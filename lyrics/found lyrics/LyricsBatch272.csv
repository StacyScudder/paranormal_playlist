Lionel Richie,"Lady, morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me
I wonder if you need me now
We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me
Remembering the pain, if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all, I do love you
Still

Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down
But then most of all, I do love you
Still

We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately
We were too blind to see, but then
Most of all, I do love you
Still",Still
Lionel Richie,"Show me a river that's so deep
Show me a mountain so high
I'll show you love that'll last forever
Flying high, so high

Ah, show me a place where dreams are for dreamers
And all the things you wish come true, yeah
I'd wish the world had all happy people
Then there'd be no more wishing to do

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh

Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,
Sweet, sweet love

Sun shines over the rainbow
High on a hill
Take a ride on a magic carpet
And you know its for real

The world is filled with all the lonely people
Trying to find their way
All they need is a hand to guide them
To a brighter day

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love (sweet, sweet love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (well, well)
Sweet love (sweet, sweet love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, yeah
Sweet love

Sweet love that comes through the ages
Reach out and touch my soul
Gave my life so much meaning
And everyone a heart of gold

Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Sweet love (well, well, well)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (sweet, sweet, sweet love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (sweet sweet, sweet sweet love)
Ooo ooo

Oh you needed love (ohh sweet love)
Sweet, sweet love
(Ohh ohh) Sweet love

I know you're searchin'
I know you're searchin', for a little love
A little peace and understanding
And I know it's been hard tryin' to find your way
But you got to keep on searchin' harder day by day
'Cause I want you, and you, you, you, you, you, you, you you and you
To stand on up, yes sir
Put a little love in your heart
And little heart in your love
Together we can make a way
Listen to me
Don't wonder to hard ah, of what I trying to say
'Cause it's love, love's the only way

Oh, nothin' but love
Oh oh (Love)
Sweet love (Sweet love, ow)
Oh, oh, oh, (When you're down and out and you can't see your way)
Sweet love (And you need a friend, well-ell-ell)

Oh, oh, oh,  (Just call on love, love)
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)",Sweet Love
Lionel Richie,"Ballerina girl
You are so lovely
With you standing there
I'm so aware
Of how much I care for you

You are more than now
You are for always
I can see in you
My dreams come true
Don't you ever go away

You make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
And when I hold you
I only want to say
I love you

Ballerina girl
The joy you bring me
Every day and night
Holding you tight
How I've waited for your love

Sometimes I've wondered
If you'd ever come my way
Now that I've finally found you
This is where my heart will stay

I'm never gonna break your heart
Never will we drift apart
'Cause all I want to do
Is share my whole life with you

'Cause you make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
I guess I finally realized
There's nothing else like loving you

Ballerina girl
You are so lovely
I can see in you
My dreams come true
Don't you ever go away

Lionel Richie,"What is happening here
Something's going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the lights
We're gonna have a party
It's starting tonight

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

The room is hot and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people startin' a climb the walls
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Come on!

Everybody start to lose control
When the music is right
If you see somebody hangin' around
Don't get uptight
The only thing we want to do tonight
Is go 'round and 'round
And turn upside down
Come on! Let's get down!

So come on! Let's get loose
Don't hold back
'Cause ain't no use
Hard to keep your feet on the ground
'Cause when we like to party
We only want to get down

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Say what?
Can't stop now
Just getting started
Everybody clap your hands
Come on
Everybody let's dance

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling baby baby
We gonna dance all night",Dancing on the Ceiling
Lionel Richie,"Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love

I spent a night in L.A.
Just another chance to see you
Just you and I
Wanted you to know
That my playing days are over
'Cause all I do is think of you
The writing's on the wall

About the one thing
I've been knowing
You're the only girl
I've ever cared for in this world

Somewhere down in east

And some hey down hey
Tell the conductor you're heading
For the cocktail car
Yes you are
That is where I'll be with my sweet
Ooh, la la, hey

The ones you love will come and go
When you lose you sacrifice
Chasing the rainbow
And if you should climb this magic ladder
The story will unfold
Just remember when you reach the top

Time, just take the time

Lionel Richie,"How will I know if someone loves me
How will I know if there is no one else
Dying to have someone who loves me
But I want them to love me for myself

Looked for love in all the wrong places
I searched the moon and stars
Found myself lost in a world full of faces
The place I didn't look was my heart

I've been all around the world try to find something new,
Lord knows that something was you
'Cause I found in myself the one thing that is true
All I want is an ordinary girl

All I need is an ordinary girl

[Chorus: x2]
All I want is someone I can talk to
Someone I can lean on now and then
And I don't want to lie, pretend I am someone else
I am just looking for a friend
My heart was going through so many changes,
I didn't know which way to turn
Just when I thought I had all of the answers
I found I still had so much to learn

I've been all around the world try to find something new,
Lord knows that something was you
'Cause I found in myself the one thing that is true
All I want is an ordinary girl
All I need is an ordinary girl

[Chorus]

Someone to love me

[Chorus]

I just want to feel lost in love forever
Want to see that look in your eyes
I hope that you understand what I am saying, baby
Cause girl I need you right by my side
I've been all around the world trying to find something new,
Lord knows that something was you
'Cause I found in myself 
The one thing that is true
All I want is an ordinary girl
All I need is an ordinary girl

[Chorus]

Someone to love me

[Chorus]

Talking: You know I've been all around the world
Trying to find someone new
He, you know what ended up my search:
That someone was you
And I found in my heart there can be no one but you
All I need is an ordinary girl

You know heaven send you from above
Oh girl, it is only you
You are the best thing in my life girl
You are the best thing in my life ooh

Lionel Richie,"Time can heal a broken heart
Oh, but does it really ease the mind
I know it's hard for you
Though you say that you're not longing for my touch
I know it pains you much
What's wrong, baby
What's on your mind
Did you leave a piece of love behind
What's wrong, baby
What is on your mind
Did you leave a piece of love behind
Night begins with calls from you
Oh, asking me if I'm alright
I'm really not sure, baby
I'm wondering if your love for me has gone away
Like I heard you say
What's wrong, baby
What's on your mind
Did you leave a piece of love behind
What's wrong, baby
What is on your mind
Did you leave a piece of love behind
It's hard to say
We've made mistakes
But when it's not over
It's best to put pride away
Two eyes should not cry the tears of regret
'Cause two lips won't let go of an age old lover's lie
Oh, baby, oh, oh
What's wrong, baby
What's on your mind
Did you leave a piece of love behind
What's wrong baby
What is on your mind
Did you leave a piece of love behind
I'd do anything for you
I will give you all my heart

I don't wanna lose you
I want you to stay

Will you make this sacrifice
It's hard to believe

There was a lady standing
Right there beside a well,

Then the vision went away
I thought that I had lost her

She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine
Now I want her next to me, 'cause I want, 'cause I want more

Why did she have to go
What do I say to find her

We talked, and then we danced
I held you close to me
Girl, you are my ecstasy
Your lips, and your hair
The way you touch me, girl I swear
Only you could take me there
I had to be your lover

You're the one, you're the only one

It's like destiny

I believe the time is right
To just let go

And you lift me up to the sky

Lionel Richie,"Here is my heart you can take it

There's a time in your life for believing
That impossible dream in your heart
When you find in one magical moment
The one you search for from the start

On a night like tonight when you're holding me
I can see in your eyes, it's you I've dreamed of

Here is my heart, you can take it
Love so strong, can't be wrong
Here is my heart, please don't break it
Come what may, here I'll stay
Here is my heart only for you

If I gave you the keys of a kingdom
If I dressed you in diamonds and pearls
It would never compare to the feeling
We have together right now

On a night like tonight, you're everything
For once in my life, it feels like Heaven

Here is my heart, you can take it
Love so strong, can't be wrong
Here is my heart, please don't break it
Come what may, here I'll stay
Here is my heart, only for you
Here is my heart, now and forever yours

Making love under the stars
Paradise is where we are
Living it up, we'll never stop
Dancing together
Round and round and round, we go
Feel the rhythm in your soul
Nothing is going to stop us
When we're dancing together
All night long forever

There's a feeling that I get
And it's way down deep inside, girl
I've been trying to hold on, but you say that you're not sure
I just hope you realize what my heart is going through

How long, must this feeling go on
How long, must I stand the pain and
How long, must this feeling go on
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the right time to come

I know all about the hurt and the problems in the past
I know why your scared of love,
'Cause you think it just wont last long
Well, I'm here to tell you what I'm saying is all true
There ain't nobody else in life
That can take the place of you

How long, must this feeling go on
How long, must I stand the pain and
How long, must this feeling go on
waiting for the night
Waiting for the right time to run

Why can't we just run away, and oh run
A place were we can be alone and nobody finds us, run
Can we both just run away, and oh run

I've often wondered how it bothered you
I know how close I came to losing you
But we managed to stay alive
I guess only the strong survive
I just gotta tell you baby

[Chorus]
Sometimes love can be so cruel
Sometimes we learn 'bout being a fool
I don't know why, girl, we've lasted so long
It may be the water
That keeps us strong

I took for granted that you'd always be there
I know it seemed at times I didn't care
I didn't know what you had given me
But with love it takes some time
But through the joy and pain, you're mine
I just gotta tell you baby

[Chorus]

It may be the water
That keeps us strong
You know that I'm so glad to say, oh baby
That it all turned out this way, ?cause you know that
It almost slipped away, oh baby
But we managed to stay alive
I guess only the strong survive
I just gotta tell you baby

You know that I'm so glad to say, oh baby

Lionel Richie,"How could this happen, I don't understand
Falling in love was just not in my plan
But I want you to know,
You just got a piece of my heart

I've been through the changes
I've walked through the pain
I've told myself I would never do this again
But I want you to know,
You just got a piece of my heart

'Cause love has been a stranger,
Love has been cruel
Lovin's made me feel like the world's one and only fool
And I promised myself I would never trust my heart again

I protected my feelings
I fought to be free
I can't believe I would let this happen to me
But I want you to know
You just got a piece of my heart

Tell me where did you come from
Tell me who sent you here
Whatever the reason, girl God made the message clear
'Cause nobody else can make me feel the way that you do
I just gotta say
That the struggle is over
My story's true, I finally realized
I want to spend my life with you
'Cause you are the one that changed the way I feel
And I swear I know this time it's real

Never in my lifetime, in my wildest dreams
Could I ever ever imagine the love that you brought to me
'Cause you are the one that changed the way I feel

How could this happen, I don't understand
Falling in love was just not in my plan
But I want you to know,
You just got a piece of my heart
But I want you to know,
You just got a piece of my heart
Just got a piece of my heart

I wake up to the thought of you and I call your name 
No one ever made me feel the way you do 
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you 
But now I've got to let go 

We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, my tender heart 
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again 
With my tender heart. 
We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad 
Knowing that I'm not the one you want 
I can't hold on to my tender heart 

I never thought I'd be the one who would play the fool 
But I know love can feel so good and can be so cruel 
It's clear to me the writing is on the wall 
It's clear to me that you don't really love me at all 
And I can't go on this way 

We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, my tender heart 
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again 
With my tender heart. 
We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad 
Knowing that I'm not the one you want 
I can't hold on to my tender heart 

I'm standing at the door 
Don't need this hurt no more 
I'm crying out in vain 
Cause you don't feel my pain. 

Maybe it was always going to be this way 
Maybe I'll look back and understand some day 
But now I've got to say 
We don't stand a chance

And that's what it feels like
To love a woman
To love a woman

When you're looking in her eyes you can see forever (forever)
You're captured by the beauty of her soul (oh yeah)

You know you're never gonna find a woman like this again

So don't let go oh (don't let go)
Will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays
And that's what it feels like
To love a woman
To love a woman

Oh she can make your day
Oh she can take it away (take it all way)
And oh whether it's wrong or right
You know it in the end you'd do it all again
To love a woman
Just to love a woman (uh huh)

Oh you know (yes I know, yes I know)
She loves you tomorrow like she loves you today (well she love you)
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays (she's yours if she stays)
And that's what it feels like (I'm gonna say it)

Lionel Richie,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

The first time I saw you
Oh, you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine
Honey you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist
Oh, Oh, Ooh, Ooh, Oh

Penny lover, my love's on fire
Penny lover, you're my one desire
Tell me baby could this be true
That I could need someone, like I need you

Nights warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl I surrender
Oh, what more can I do
I've spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl I'll do anything, just please stay
Oh, Oh

I don't understand it, Oh what's come over me
But I'm not gonna worry, no not anymore
'Cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
With a love like yours, it's hard to resist
Ooh, Ooh, Oh

Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (don't you make me cry baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (Oh penny baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)

Lionel Richie,"Lady, morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me
I wonder if you need me now
We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me
Remembering the pain, if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down
But then most of all, I do love you
Still
 
We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me
Cause I needed you so desperately
We were too blind to see, but then
Most of all, I do love you",Still [Live]
Lionel Richie,"Thanks for the times that you've given me,
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!

Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you.
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
I love you !",Three Times a Lady [Live]
Lionel Richie,"I don't know what it is but she drives me crazy
I don't know what she does but she drives me wild
If only she could let me be the man I want to be
Well she can leave me helpless as a child

I don't know how it is but she has the power
She can make me laugh when I want to cry (oh yeah)
She tells me that I'm in control but I know it's just a lie

And I don't mind oh
Will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays
And that's what it feels like
To love a woman
To love a woman

When you're looking in her eyes you can see forever (forever)
You're captured by the beauty of her soul (oh yeah)

You know you're never gonna find a woman like this again

So don't let go oh (don't let go)
Will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays
And that's what it feels like
To love a woman
To love a woman

Oh she can make your day
Oh she can take it away (take it all way)
And oh whether it's wrong or right
You know it in the end you'd do it all again
To love a woman
Just to love a woman (uh huh)

Oh you know (yes I know, yes I know)
She loves you tomorrow like she loves you today (well she love you)
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays (she's yours if she stays)
And that's what it feels like (I'm gonna say it)
And that's what it feels like (what it feels like oh)
And that's what it feels like
To love a woman (mm hmm)
To love a woman (oh oh)
Yes to love a woman",To Love a Woman
Lionel Richie,"Every night and every day
My heart feels the pain
I wake up to the thought of you
And I call your name

No one ever made me feel the way you do
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
But now I've got to let go

We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, my tender heart
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
With my tender heart

We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, oh, it hurts so bad
Knowing that I'm not the one you want
I can't hold on to my tender heart

I never thought I'd be the one
Who would play the fool
But I know love can feel so good
And can be so cruel

It's clear to me the writing is on the wall
It's clear to me that you don't really love me at all
And I can't go on this way

We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, my tender heart
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
With my tender heart

We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, oh, it hurts so bad
Knowing that I'm not the one you want
I can't hold on to my tender heart

I'm standing at the door
Don't need this hurt no more
I'm crying out in vain
'Cause you don't feel my pain, oh

Maybe it was always gonna be this way
Maybe I'll look back and understand some day
But now I've got to say

We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, my tender heart
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
With my tender heart

That shooting start that's in the sky
How did I. Get to be by your side

I say these words tonight,
You are my pure daylight

It seems like heaven
When I'm laying with you

Lionel Richie,"You held my hand and then you slipped away
And I may never see your face again
So tell me how to fill the emptiness inside
Without love, what is life? And anyone who knew us
both can see We always were the better part of me
I never wanted to be this free And all this pain, when does it go away?

Then every time I turn around And you're nowhere to be found I know
I gotta long long way to go Before I can say
goodbye to you Oh, I gotta long long way I know
Before I can say goodbye To all I ever knew, to you To you

From memory there is no hiding place Turn on the TV and I see you there
In every crowd there's always someone with your face
Everywhere, trying not to care

Then every time I turn around And you're nowhere to be found I know
I gotta long long way to go Before I can say
goodbye to you Oh, I gotta long long way I know
Before I can say goodbye To all I ever knew

To you I wish you everything And all the best that life can bring
I only hope you think of me sometimes Oh, and even though I fell the pain
I know that you will love again The time will come and you'll move on

I gotta long long way to go Before I can say
goodbye to you Oh, I gotta long long way I know
Gotta long way to go Before I can say goodbye

Night was play
Pain was all a world away
We went to school
We learned the rules
We trusted all they had to say

Then life took a turn
We all had to learn
And we can't go back again

And my heart is breaking
Just for you
Just for you

Lionel Richie,"Here I am standing in the mirror, looking in my eyes
Trying not to fool myself, and realize
Times are getting harder for us to get along
Everything about this love is all going wrong
You keep on telling me to do this, do that
And I need to change my ways
But I think that maybe the price of this love
Is too high to pay

Ball and chain, is the feeling that I am feeling tonight
When love's a ball and chain
It don't matter who's wrong or right

I keep on living in confusion, wondering where I am at
Trying to figure out if I should do this thing or that
I can't see the future, and I can't change the past
But I'm feeling that this love of ours just ain't gonna last
I've been down one time, two times, three times, fou
I've been waiting for times to get better 
And I can't take it no more

Ball and chain, that's the feeling that I am feeling tonight
This love's a ball and chain
It don't matter who's wrong or right

Time, I would love for time to be on our side
But I know that this love affair is all over now

Ball and chain, it's a feeling that I am feeling tonight
This love's a ball and chain
It don't matter who's wrong or right
This love's a ball and chain
It's a feeling that I am feeling inside

You know she's nothing to ya, She wants me

When a guy like me has everything she needs
Well, I don't believe you understand, The power of my game
You just got to know that girl is into me

Of all the things I take back
If I had a wish it would be that

(You feel it, I feel it, let's not pretend)

Baby, I don't know what love is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
'Cause they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love

It's so clear for you to see
(Don't let nobody tell you what to do)
Why they can't they just let us be happy
(I don't want to find somebody new)
If you know what's really in your heart
Then don't let them tear us apart
('Cause you feel it, I feel it, let's think this through)

Baby, I don't know what love is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
'Cause they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love

We have a bond that's unbreakable
And it's not time to let it go (We're in love)
And now that we know it's real
We are going to let it show
To the whole world
That I'm yours forever
And you're my girl
(You are my girl)

Baby, I don't know what love is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth

Lionel Richie,"Here I finally come to stand 
My pen and paper in hand 
To write to you 

To tell you what I feel inside 
To say to you I can't survive 
Without you 

For all the things I've come to see 
I now beleive there's only you 
Only you for me 

I'm standing here so lost in you 
That's all my heart and soul can do 
Is say what's true 

I love you 
I love you 

The first time I looked in your eyes 
It was so clear to my surprise 
My heart stood still 

I'v eheard it time and time again 
That when you fall you can't pretend 
True love is real 

I know with you I do belong 
You are my voice my simple song 
You're all I need 

The joy I feel when love is blind 
You're everything I need to find 
My search is through 

Babe I love you 
I lvoe you 
Babe I love you 
I love you 

Cause I know with you I do belong 
You are my voice my simple song

I've been here about an hour
They keep saying come talk to me
I keep thinking there's one and they say us three
Standing there getting out of the shower
Turning around showing me the thing got power

Started to converse and I sense a problem
And I'm thinking girl I can always solve them
But she didn't want to hear it
She says she is all mine and I can make him feel it
All along I was thinking it was gonna be her plus two
Now they're looking like Lionel the joke's on you
Next thing I'm feeling is her up and down
While the girls are watching

Baby, by the time you get this letter
I'll be gone
But I left something for you on the pillow
Put this tape in
Press play
I love you

It's four in the morning, I'm sitting here at night
I'm writing you this song to say what's on my mind
I'm leaving in an hour, and you won't be up in time to say goodbye, whoa
I'm putting this on tape (baby, you're wonderful)
I really mean it, babe (more than you will ever know)
I wish that I could stay (but I gotta go)
I'll be back, but in the meantime
Keep in mind

[Chorus]
(What you are)
Something too big for words
And it's my pleasure to love you, baby, for better or worse
('Cause what you are)
A beautiful mother to your kids
Sometimes, it slips my mind, so in case I forget
(Girl, you are) you're better than (anything)
I ever had
(You are) the perfect love
(Never give you up because you are) 
My heart, my soul, my breath
Take it all until there's nothing left
'Cause, baby, you are

Now, no man has ever loved his woman
More than I love you
Girl, you know it's true
And no man can ever say he does his woman better than I do you
That ain't true (here's what I do)
Send you fresh-cut roses every day of the week
Take you shopping whenever
More importantly
Wrap my loving arms around you
To reassure everything I felt that first night
I feel it more

Lionel Richie,"It's been this many years 
It's been that many years 
And still have to ask the same question 
Why? 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When you and me would kiss at night 
Remember what we tripped like 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Funny me, funny you 
Don't have nothing lft in common 
You wanted me to have your heart 
Now you want it back 
What about the promise you made to me 
That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason 
And suddenly we're flying high 
Now it's Mayday we're falling fast 
You're trying to get lost 
I'm trying to pull up 
And damn I can't say 
You said you didn't need me 
I really didn't think that you would leave me 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When you and me would kiss at night 
Remember what we tripped like 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Now the kids are looking at me like I'm to blame 
No longer got their respect for me 
Don't want to hear what I'm saying 
I know how it feels to be ashamed 
Cause when I was young I felt that pain too 
And I can't say nothing that would cause you to make a change 
And that's the reason that we're going our separate ways 
Then who am I fooling 
What am I doing thinking you love me 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When you and me would kiss at night 
Remember what we tripped like 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

You would think by this time I would get it right 
Know the schemes and the things that make it be right 
When you said you could stay no longer 
I thought I had just a little more daylight 
LIke when we use to turn a fight into a good night 
I know the things I use to do to make you feel right 
I would give anything the fortune I made 
To bring back the days that the feeling was so right 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When you and me would kiss at night 
Remember what we tripped like 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night

I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time little darling
I'm coming home to stay

I'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
I'm mighty glad you stayed",Stuck on You [DVD]

Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, your once, twice

Life was all big and I scream
Truths were true and lies were lies
We thought love would never die

But the world moved on 
My illusions gone 
And I don't know who to blame 

And my heart is breakingâ?¦Just for you just for you 
And my arms are openâ?¦just for you just for you 
And these tears I'm crying are just for you just for you 
Just forâ?¦ you

Give me shelter from the storm
I just hope this light inside me keeps me strong

Stare at the sea. Stare at the sea. I dream
I dream. And hope. And wish

Some things are best expressed by nature
Like the song of a sun
We split our roads in a race to power
Like we split the atom

Is it only love that you favor?
Truth is the flavor
Fear is the flip side
No faith in the warm skin

Brotherhood shows when the surface breaks from the outside
So you encounter yourself
While watching you body cry
When the all the faults don't seem like the tools you used to create your life

Thoughts fermenting
I am repenting
For the trouble I caused
My peace. My wars

Looks through the ripples to rocks in the bed

Roots hold to rocks as the currents fled

Life to expression sounds like a blood flow
Ear to the skin heartbeat of a man

Man on a hill watching the city
He looks through the clouds the clocks in the tower
Well life brought the surface, protect what's within
Same from the winds and the foreign power

Man broke the surface the woman and the child
Dream now the columns of black smoke
Life to corruption the fear of the true flow

",Number Nine
Lionrock,"I want to taste a new dessert
To see how other people work
To see them irrigate the dirt
With water from a bank.
I took my tape and tape recorder
And made my way up to the border
Where I received a legal order
From a man who drove a tank.
Wanted to see another country
But the country wouldn't have me
They said they have a new policy
To protect their economy.
I said I want to see your city
They said they couldn't entertain me
They said they simply had too many
And If I tried they would detain me.

He said, â??You haven't any place here
Why you show your face here?
I'll keep you at the base here
Don't move â??til you're told.â??
He returned with the command
â??Go back to your land. The only way to enter is with gold.â??

What you get is what you see not what they say (x5)
A promise in a second. The truth will take a day
To see the truth in every step along the way
Is like a child that learns to judge within his play

I want to turn my water to wine, but I'm not divine
So I must feel work to do it.
I want to turn their sorrow to salt, the weak to the strong
So we've got to think our way through it.
Closing in from all quarters. Pressure to achieve is like I'm forced to grow
All your sons and your daughters. They have to fight to keep the little that they know

I never wanted to be free until I knew I was in prison
I didn't know I was a key until I unlocked the pain in living'
I want to see the vegetation To inspire my vocation
To see the plans of every nation. Hear the words from their hearts.

Won't rest 'til the folks sing tunes from the heart string sounds from the true springs of our histories
Confessed let them come through lives that evade you born to renew and explain our mysteries
Your eyes won't lie when they're allowed to see
Your sun, your skies see that you're allowed to be
Your reason why so we're wise to take heed 
Your time, your earth, so plant your seeds (x3)
Plant your seeds [Repeat]",Straight at Yer Head

Lionrock,"Fall into line. I clocked the card today
Conveyor whizzes past my hands
The supervisor spies a quiet corner 
Thinks he better warn a peace says in his plans
Assemble pieces of the nucleic craze
Conveyor quizzes the pneumatic mind
And while we're working are we seeking different thoughts
Spinning wheels away the pennies we can find
Design the future from the scraps you find
Display emotion with a toxic bloom
The new machine is up and running now
And in less time it prints the labels, good as new
Overdue or over done, before we crawl we try to run
And that's the all we try to reach 
Before we learn we try to teach
A kind of dance-too close to find
Who sees the generation with their souls in mind?

We let off steam from the magnetic coil
Then we use a spark to raise the precious oil
The supervisor spies, the traffic queues
The news says we could loose while all the rivers boil
Should we leave them to devices, they would price things way too high
When I greet a man en route who claims I'm sentenced to comply
You're in the wrong zone. You've found the wrong place.
So take your dreams home. You need to interface.
And could you pull the thread unwrap the cloak to leave him bare?
See the truth before illusions that is in despair
A solid corpse, too sure to hide
Who shields the generations from the coming tide?

Opinions are opinions are opposed until they prove
But even when well founded the astounded won't be moved
So take the feeling high. Just let the feelings fly.
From macrocosm to the microscopic world of me
A force instills a life, who knows how long a life would be?
Envelope, attack, decay, release
We'll let this reign and thus sustain a kind of peace",Amazing New Product
Lionrock,"She's here to test the future man
With x-ray eyes for every plan
Don't try to compromise her views
She'll win the day and make the news

Sometimes her cycle makes her sick
But she's too quick to keep it down
She's dressed for flight, the perfect night
A silver stream walked into town

And in her eyes 
A simple cure
For young or old, for rich or poor

When everything she saw was her and of her mind
Would she bathe in all what was good until all else believed she's blind
Making her choices with her emotions
She begged stability while she stirred the world's commotions

She was shocked. 
Door was locked.
Now it's opened up and pours the truth in to her cups

She lives her life the way it came
Summer's tease and learn to pain
Played her games in city streets
To taste the life she longed to keep

Sometimes her cycle made her sick 
But she was quick to keep her poise
She blew her top and caused a tidal wave to drown the world in noise
But in a thought, she would forgive
And granted need, to light, to live",She's on the Train
Lionrock,"Listen ends again into the desert street, 
A strange kind of violence
And like a legend creeping down the alleyways, 
It waves a hand to silence
All though we're not aware, there is a presence there 
Until we hear them teasing
Spitting curses, verses from the sacred books of long forgotten reason
Silken suits, the clicks of heels, 
The midnight hour long decayed
The spirit moves till busker plays 
Till he wishes he could never played
But the street wise listen 
While the wet roads glisten
Don't know what you're missing

I wouldn't carry you through this tonight 
But the melody's here and the beats are all right
And though there's a risk from the street hood, 
In the mist of the rain we can feel good
All though we're not aware, 
There is a presence there, 
Until we see teasing
Stealing time in motor grime working like a lamp through the vampire season

Heaven, soothe, power versus dancers in to a groove
Moves through the inner sun with shinning proof
You've carried all the blessing you can see 
That you were getting what you fear
Love lies close to all the hate you could've reared
Blue skies always under cloud that disappears
You've died too, but wrong thing, hear the song bring proof
Under life's wing, many cycling truth

A lover's fight, the blues patrol, 
She tries to keep the cash she made
Out on the streets since twilight, 
Now she's wishing that she never stayed
But the street wise listen 
While the wet roads glisten
Don't know what you're missing

Boys from the bar spilling out
Climbs into the car without a shadow of a doubt
Boys hit a drunk on the street, 
Passenger screams as he flies from the seat
Lives in a tangle or worse, 
Lift from the pipe of the night in a hearse
Lives in a gamble or more, 
A lift from the plain day
A lift from the plain day

And the truth will set you free
From the broken lamp lying at the corner of a memory
Treasures to be found
Yes this is your town [Repeat x2]
I guess this is your town
Yes this is your town",Wet Roads Glisten

Momma had the radio bumpin' and the block was jumpin'
And my neighbors showed love

And the music was better
Fast forward in to the ninety's and eight ball leathers
Even though crime was high
Momma said ride your bike but don't leave the block

We had house parties moved to block parties
B-Boys dance they wouldn't fight nobody
Things were a little safer then, yeah

And I remember Jack Tripper, George and Weezie
Come five thirty Good Times was on TV

Applejacks on my lap sitting watching Thundercats

Night Court had the bass line bumpin'

That's when TV was better
I remember rockin' cross color sweaters
And even though crime was high
Used it turn on the fire plug chill on the block

Teach them to love and we can't lose
Help them to find the right path to choose

Life's a crack house socked in tears
Church a packed house covered in fear
God love reigns down on His children

And everyday a life is thrown away
When everyday there's a life to gain
Christ accepts all sinners the same
Men and women just reaching for change

I'm from the ghetto, I'm from the gutter where it all goes down
And in the ghetto is where the Most High change me around
We've been praying and I think we see now
We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it

I'm from the ghetto where stars are born
Record deals no sales leave young men scorned
Little women with big women bodies make them feel grown
You cast the first stone

Seventeen of the grind a formality
Cutting school smoking weed a reality
Little babies having babies it's so sad to see
Men and women of the church are taking back the streets

I'm from the ghetto, I'm from the gutter where it all goes down
And in the ghetto is where the Most High change me around
We've been praying and I think we see now
We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it

I'm from the ghetto where guns are used by
Little ones that are often abused
20/20's Badlands the news consist of thugs
But Christians live here too, let's change

I'm from the ghetto, I'm from the gutter where it all goes down
And in the ghetto is where the Most High change me around
We've been praying and I think we see now
We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it

If I ever make it out the hood congratulate me
Lately I've been feeling like I'm trapped here
Last year feels like the other day
And another day goes by but it's the same thing

What can I do different, how can I make a change?
Feels like a deja vu but still I maintain
Feels like I paid my dues when I was eighteen
Would my music appeal to you if I was mainstream?

Woke up this morning looked around my cell
Can't believe I get to leave today
Thank the Lord Jesus Christ the most high
I started to cry as I prayed

I can't wait to walk with my son
And see the big smile on his face
And make up for every single day
That I was gone

I said peace to my mans in C block
Fam in E block and Pastor James
I couldn't believe that the time was coming
I would finally be on my way

I never thought that I'd leave here breathing
But thank God for my faith
I took one last look at the yard
I took one last look at the guard
And said I'm ready to go

Oh, I was locked down, hopeless until You looked my way
I was doubtful that You would forgive a man like me
You are the reason that I can finally say
That I'm free

I spoke to the guard said, ""I'm leaving a new man""
Shook his right hand then I headed for the front gate
I could see my son jumping for joy
I smiled back at the guard and said that's my boy

I hugged my son with a knot in my throat
Thanked my wife for all the letters she wrote
For staying with me through this four and a half
For being a mother, for being a dad

I said, ""Thank you baby for sticking with me through these hard times
Sorry baby for every single night I made you cry""
She said, ""Don't worry I'm just glad your alive
Ready to start brand new and push the old to the side""

Thank You Lord I couldn't thank You more
For everything You've done in my life
I praise You Lord, I couldn't repay You Lord
For keeping me alive, it's good to be back babe

Free

Oh, I was locked down, hopeless until You looked my way
I was doubtful that You would forgive a man like me
You are the reason that I can finally say
That I'm free

Sorry baby, for every single night I made you cry

Liquid,"Police man stepping on my foot
With his heals so I won't run
He said I'm suspected of a robbery
That happened down on Lexington

I told him I was on my way home
From the store and I worked all day
Then I was thrown in the back seat of his car
And my rights were read

As the cuffs dug deep into my skin
And my wrist began to bruise
I looked to the Most and asked Him
For strength to get me through this one time

One time
That's all it took for me to find
One time
A reason to change my mind

One time
And look up to the Most High
One time

It only takes one time for you to make a bad choice

So call me back and don't say you ain't got no tracks

All the things that we cannot afford
We can deny 'em but it's your decision on the other
You made me high though I was coming down
You made me fly as if you were a clown

Building me up
Burning me out
Why should I quit
I'm rockin' no doubt
Tell me what's wrong
What can I do
Forget about that
The joke is on you

You made me cry and did not know my name
But I loved you so you're the one to blame
What can I do to make you feel the same
You're treating me as if it was a game

Whatever comes I'll watch you on your way
Whoever comes might know what is supposed to say
He will show his collection by gas-light
Makin' love, loving at first sight

Only for nights in ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean for my love to find.

But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
Nor do I, have wings to fly
If I could find me a handsome boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

Of happy times spent long ago.

Have all passed on now, like melting snow.

Soft is the grass and my bed is free.

Far beyond imagination.

Just an itching in my heart,

When you're thirsty, drink your fill,

Causing my heart complication,
Love is a growing infection,
And I don't know the correction, 
Got me rocking and a-reeling,
And I can't shake the feeling.

"Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes","Woman of my own and tranquil key
No I'm not just the L out of TLC
Songstress for the longest
Felt more adappa as a rappa
Start to make what it seems
It's more mind over matter
Have fun
Comin' with beats & rhymes
But it's not so sweet in this light of lime
Sometimes when you make it people get mad
Throw buckets grab, backs get stabbed
It was a hard struggle, meaning shit
Now it's hard just tryin' to juggle this, among shit
So people see the smile
All the while I have an inner child
That's cryin' denial (cry in denial)
Cryin' no smile, cryin' with style of beguile
In piles in aisles of niles
Meanwhile seem so senile, fakes monsters
I'm docile, fragile
I show gentile smiles, I take it a mile
People don't see the truth, in this booth
Under my tongue, over my tooth (ah-ooohh)
Eight nine spoof of my inner youth
Innocence

So just close your eyes
And relax your mind
As the sounds dig in your brain
Now don't it feel so strange
So just close your eyes
And relax your mind

Awards and claps

But to a lyricist, chastising conniving, criticists
Gotta earn your bliss, unchill your wrists
I know you mince, add bills to rent
So now you owe me
That's why I'm so into it
This tapestry
Put you abstract, non-skilled folks can't see
I hinted at them, add tracks
Don't care if you're mad at
I speak the past
I speak rash spirits
Universal, helped my lyric rehearsals of the here's
Become an adult from peers, much fears, such tears
Scorned from revelations dawn
Things I do like, morning lawns
I'm morning poems
That now yawnin' on
They're not spawning wands (they're not spawning wands)
This here wand has a magic stick
Throat-wise called the Larynx
Helps me spill it, my utter of a mind
I milk it
So that it hits your back with spiritual parmalat
I farm the black
Spirit staff, Spirit staff, Spirit staff

So just close your eyes
And relax your mind
As the sounds dig in your brain
Now don't it feel so strange
So just close your eyes
And relax your mind
As the sounds dig in your brain
Now don't it feel so strange

When the house burnt down
Only I made the blame
When the money got funny, I took it to court
When most of y'all scrubs
Wouldn't have even fought it
When the group had issues, I laid in thought
Corrected the bad news, I heard in interviews
How many of you really know Lisa? Not many!
It's not contrary, it's fear, I don't know you either
I'm responsible for more than you'll ever know or see
So many things you don't know happened because of me
From Blaque, to the designs of the stage, that was me
So how could any of y'all be mad at me?

Everybody says all they want is the truth
Well the truth is I still got love for my group
But you don't really want the truth when it's concernin' you
You want to hear that no one's doin' better than you
You love to hear the pain
You love to hear the struggle
You love to know that paradise
Has got trouble
The only trouble we ever had
Is you bein' involved
You gettin' involved where you don't belong
When my faith started to waver it was like I was done
I felt like Brian McKnight I was ""Back At One""
The only one that was
The only one that ever
The only one I need
The one and only me
Because if I hadn't told you it was on different planes
You would think that I meant our flights ain't the same
My only crime was I was so blind
Didn't know I had everything I wanted all the time

"Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes","What is life?
To live is to believe
To love
Is to receive
Check it out
Check it out now

Young woman confused
Young woman abused
You must understand
It's never too late to lose who you are
And choose who you are supposed to be
Supposed to become
You've been in and out
Up and down, back and forth
Backwards around
Not a friend, not a mother, not a father
Just God and you should make a choice
What you ought to do
What matters most
Who you are to you
Opinions of the old and young
Shouldn't matter to you
Take advice think it over twice
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night
Night is decent, but recently
Things have shown us
We have done the wrong things often
Never suicide, that's the easy route
There's always another way out
Think about it (think about it)

[Chorus]
Life is like
Life is like a park
Seesaws, merry-go-rounds
And though you may swing high
Sometimes you may even fall down
And though you may get stuck
You must get back up
You are bloomin' love

Now see if you went through life with your eyes closed
You never would've known there was a high road
Let people get the best of you and get mad at them
Instead of bein' mad at yourself
You're only number one in your life
And you will decide if it goes right
Every time you digress
Defeat your progress
Feed you lunch, but you must digest
The controversy yo can get personal
They don't understand it's the role reversal
Seekin' fame, play their games
Gave a whole lot for a whole little game
When push comes to shove
Do you push or shove?
When the choice is yours
Do you leave with love?
All the tears you cried, you're dyin' inside
When will you decide to survive
Think about it

[Chorus: x2]

Clap your hands, this evenin', everybody
Clap your hands
Why don't you clap your hands everybody?
Everybody clap your hands
Why don't you clap your hands, oh Left Eye?
Everybody clap your hands
Why don't you clap your hands everybody?
Everybody clap your hands y'all
Clap your hands y'all, ohh clap your hands
If you believe it, clap your hands
Bloomin' love

[Chorus]

Sometimes you may fall down
But you gotta get back up and try it again
Try it again and try it again
And Try it again
And try it again
And try it again",Life Is Like a Park
"Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes","I believe when someone passes away
Either a star is born, energy so pure
That it creates new worlds
Or as the soul releases
Shatters into pieces
Becoming free flowing thoughts
For my mental thesis
Maybe we just don't understand
The spirits that still walk the land
Or whatever the case
I believe that we all still remain
To share the same space

So dad, I know you're listenin'
How you been?
Oh, I'm doin' fine, just passin' time
Submerged in sin sometimes I take a bath
And just get all dirty again
I try to cleanse my mind, cleanse my soul and get in
Into that place you've been
No, I'm not tryin' to rush anything
I just wanna visit you because I miss you
So what you tryin' to say?
My imagination been wild since I been a child
And since you're laughin' then
I take it that good things are happenin'

[Chorus]
The day I learned you were gone
A new star was born
Distant voices fill my mind
Said look up in the sky
And when I did there you were

Well, I'm sure you already know this
I'm a big pop star
And my pops is a star (ha ha)
No, you really are
Sometimes I feel like an anus
I kinda made you a little famous
Always spillin' my guts
Explainin' to these people who think I'm nuts
Told them how you and moms knuckled up
My excuse for being such a disrupt
Yeah, they sure did
They called you an abusive drunk
Sorry, I didn't realize the media would run with it
But now I know and sometimes I try to have fun with it

[Chorus]

What did you say you wish to be free
Been here all this time because of me
And on August 16, 2001
Anything that I wish to release
Release? I see.
First of all I give you my thanks for preparing me
To be open and free
I release my mind releasin' my soul
Release the courage to break the mold
Release my record 20 million sold
Release my pops you're free to go
Create a new galaxy, yes dad
You'll still be right next to me

Comin' to you from Supernova (AKA Left Eye)

I'm goin', I'm goin' from rags to riches (ha ha ha ha)
I'm goin', I'm goin' from rags to riches (ha ha ha ha)

I started off as an army brat (Atten-hut!)
Seven months old class act
I was racing down the block
As a matter of fact
I could've been a track star (I guess I am)
I stacked bars
Comin' through your system in them phat cars (uh)
Cross country isn't that far
It's like I'm in the race, don't know who you cats are
See one day I fell from grace, landed in this place
My innocence erased from talkin' back to my momma's face
Like I was lost in space
Without a trace, cuttin' class, bein' Mrs. Fast Ass
Gettin' blasted with my dad, got caught up in the flash
My Nana goin' straight mad, had to make the dash
Saw a fella through the streets
Who would give anything for cash
And anything to crash in anybody's path
If everything I had
Look at what I could grab (check it)
And it was just a bunch of niggas

[Chorus: x2]
I'm goin' from rags to riches
From rags to riches
I'm goin' from rags to riches
I bet you I'mma be the richest

Mama diggin' for her green, last dolla (dolla bill)
To pay for the phone bill, electric bill, water bill
How you feel when you make a mill?
And move your mama to a house on the hill
With picture framed TV's on the wall
Hard and I'm pissed when she wanna ball
A cell phone for when she wanna call
She ballin' out of control
With her own bank roll, I got her back though
One for the money and two for the show
Mama floors stayin' clean 600 green outside
Showin' them the many ways that God provides in life
Or who can see the bigger picture
And tell a story from goin' dead broke to gettin' richer
Knowin' I'm gettin' with you in this paper chase
Rags to riches all up in your face

[Chorus]

I remember sellin' weed
Can't believe that I was poisonin' my folk
Now I let my throat be the antidote
Always kept my hopes high
Now mama don't cry, 'cause I'll be close by
With the most high I was playin' Robin Hood (in the hood)
Little Red Riding Hood
Til' the barrel pointed where I stood (yeah, I stood)
But walked away like I was absolutely positively sure I could
Attitude on drugs
A few dollars in the bucket
And scheming steady dreaming
For a chance to make some duckets
Caused a little ruckus on the sideline
From the alley way to Cali, on the Grammy day
Went from disarray to mayday, mayday, mayday
Ran away from the sickness with a quickness
And went from rags to riches

I'm lovin' everybody that's tryin' to get it from rags to riches
From nuttin' to somethin' (ha ha right)
You know what I'm sayin'
I'm nuttin' but a quickie story from rags to riches
To all my mournin' ghetto superstars out there
Much love!
I'm backin' everybody, East coast, West coast, the Midwest
Everything you know what I'm sayin', it's all hip hop
Much love!

We all came from rags and went to riches
And the ones that's still messin' with them rags

Like waking up in the stormy weather in your mind thinking
Oh, this could be so much better (I'm telling y'all)
I'll never forget her
Black leather down for whatever
My niggas sweat time
So we sitting in  this club
Where the ladies rub-a-dub
They solicitin' their love
Me and my man about as tight as you can get it
So he admitted that he wanted to hit it
I said now wait a minute, I can contest
To being bout as open-minded as it gets
When it comes to sex
Cause I believe in time and space and what a waste
If you can't really have your time and space
So what was the use?
But to swallow my pride to love and let loose of this feelin inside
Said if you want it that bad then you should have it
And then he smiled and said I want you to grab it

[Chorus]
True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only
True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only

I'm on the hunt to get my nigga what he wants
From back to front of the club
She's trying to pull a stunt
Even though they got the lights down low
I can see the whole dance floor
She must have slipped out the back door
Rather than going back empty handed
I know this ain't the way he planned it
I do as if commanded
Let's see who next be the finest
Who next be the best for sex
And messing with his Highness
So I took another look and guess who's back
I'm off the hook
It's the lady in black
Excuse me Miss, see that man sitting at the table
He wants to know
If you're ready willing and able
So she followed me and obviously
My man is gonna want a little privacy but I was wrong
He turned it up another notch
Asked if she went tongue to crotch
And said he wants to watch

[Chorus]

So now I'm thinking what have I done and gotten into?
Maybe this will be strong and maybe monumental
As I look in her eyes what is she gonna say?
Never thought I'd be in dismay when I woke up today
She said her thing ain't girls we in three different worlds
So he mentioned instead that he wanted some head
She obliged no menage then fled
We were straight for bout a month
Until pure lust were the topics we discussed
Though I didn't mind he wants it all the time
More women and all I've been in
Spreading venom and still want to be mine
So I told him one day can't do it any more
He reacts so relaxed
Said he's done with them for sure
Then I caught him one weekend
Cheating and creeping ducts leaking don't speak
I'll be leaving

Now
Now what do you believe?
Who do you receive?
Where do you go next?
And through what exit do you leave?
The questions that I believe confessions go to He
Count your many lessons and blessings that they bring
This is for my breed and all life that is conceived
Energy told me you manifest your destiny
What is energy?
It's what you eat
It's what you breathe
It's what you think
It permeates throughout your being
And serves a link to all other energies
That's anything and everything
Moving light that you have never seen
And light carries information
Without hesitation vibrations glean
Through the constellation, manifestation stimulated
Better destination, total creation realizations
And mental concentration
Alienated from the truth
Is why we conversated
Savin' the nation for the youth
Is for my observation

[Chorus]
Are you free or are you guided?
Do you make your own decisions?
Our only responsibility is love (love)

Let's touch on Christianity
I question all humanity
Is God so full of vanity?
That children enter this family
Who haven't yet to see that Jesus is the key
Or suffer this calamity, I cast you down for an eternity
Insanity
You can call me what you want to
But the man in me
Separated from this false reality
Would never be the victim of casualty
For my lack of understanding there's a guarantee
Spirituality has immortality
No matter your status or nationality
What's your locality notice the fallacy
We're all separated by principalities
Billions of galaxies and all you see is this
In the totality of eternal bliss
A life of sin it's all the kin

[Chorus: x2]

You see, we like to make things complicated
You don't have to read books and go to church
To learn about God
And find out
We don't know how to talk to each other
You know if we all just be quiet
Then we'll realize that we can really hear each other
And then you'll realize that you already have the answers

"Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes","This one right here goes out to everybody
And it doesn't matter who your are
Cause I know that everybody has a friend

What defines a friend, the meaning
Where does it lye
In the mind, in the money, in the face, in the eyes
In the days, in the nights, well what is a friend
Do you love it and leave it again and again
So now our story begins of two little friends
You would have thought they were twins
Would have thought they were kidding
Wouldn't think they can bend
Because all the time they would spend
For each other they would fend
For they friends to the end
Their mothers know mothers
Sisters know brothers
Mothers know fathers
Sons know they daughters
They blood thicka then water
If one had fifty cents they'd both have a quarter
That only makes sense, adjusting levels and all
They grew up together from pre-k to high school
Winters in the snow, summers in the pool
He's and athlete, she's an actress
But hormones would lead them

[Chorus]
You have been there, through thick and thin
Always beside me, you are my friend
More than money, fortune, or fame
Forever and ever, we will remain
We will remain friends

Not furious just curious
She saw himself fit
Who better than the boo the girl grew up with
How bout the walks in the park
On the phone all night
Dreams like that she saw in plain sight
To his friends he's urgent
Simple fact she's a virgin
To her he'll be urging sexually let's merge
As you can see there's two different dreams
Her thoughts are so pure, his low as the floor
She's looking he's balking
Now walking and talking
Bout a new stage and phase
That they should embark in
So it came to that length
No dinner, no candlelight
The female exhales
Something doesn't feel right
She said it polite, honey please not tonight
Cuz he didn't get any, he got real malignant
Hit her, it hurt, her breath got suspended
Then he looked at his work not feeling:

[Chorus]

Their meeting had ended
Feeling offended, he went and attended
To a counseling session
Now life is a lesson
Full of questions
Why be drowned down
Rather than manifested
Went to his friend right from the beginning
With tears in his eyes he said I apologize
She much obliged, made amends
Once again, they're friends to the end
Yea, it was true love again
As transparent as when
A parent is caring
What defines a friend
Where does it lye
In the mind, in the money, in the face, in the eyes
In the days, in the nights, what is a friend
Did you love it and leave it again and again
In time in the sadness in the hurt in the pride
It's the person dispersing through the hands of time

[Chorus]

You have been there, through thick and thin
Always beside me, you are my friend
More than money, fortune, or fame

Bet your bi**h cant do it like me

And when you see me on the street I'm lookin' fresh
And when you see me on the town I'm lookin' fresh

"Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes","Young woman confused
Young woman abused
You must understand
It's never too late to, lose who you are
And choose who you are supposed to be
Supposed to become
You've been in and out
Up and down, back and forth
Backwards around
Not a friend, not a mother, not a father
Just God and you should make a choice
What you ought to do
What matters most
Who you are to you
Opinions of the old and young
Shouldn't matter to you
Take advice think it over twice
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night
It's decent, but recently
Things have shown us
We have done the wrong things often
Never suicide, that's the easy route
There's always another way out
Think about it (think about it)

[Chorus: x2]
You can give up
Or you can get up
Just don't let what you need pass by
Spread your wings to the sky
Let you soul fall in love

You can fly

Now see if you went through life with your eyes closed
You never would'a known there was a high road
Let people get the best of you and get mad at them
Instead of bein' mad at yourself
You're only number one in your life
And you will decide if it goes right
Every time you digress
Defeat your progress
Feed you knowledge, but you must digest
The controversy yo can get personal
They don't understand till the role reversal
Seekin' fame, play their games
Gave a whole lot for a whole little gain
Push comes to shove
Do you push or shove?
When the choice is yours
Do you leave or you love?
All the tears you cried, you're dyin' inside
When will you decide to survive

You can fly
Fly [Repeat: x4]

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

La culotte dans son ménage

En culotte comme un zouave

Lisa Asher,"Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack.
I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight.

I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes

Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room
 
Baby it's a dream come true
Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

Trumpets sound I hear thunder boom

Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me",In a Sentimental Mood

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

Growin' up livin' in my own little world, so it seemed
I had my dolls and dreams
Momma was always there to comfort me and give me love
And there wasn't nothin' quite like it in the world that I knew of

Before I knew it I was standin' in my teens
Sweet little boy with his strong young arms holdin' me
I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Ooh, it like to drove me crazy and I remember sayin'
""I never felt nothin' like this""

So I went and asked momma, ""Can you tell me what it means?""
She said, ""You're in love and that's every little girl's dream?
""Baby, what you found is every little girl's dream""

So I said, ""Momma, does love ever last?""
She said, ""Worry about now and let the future come to pass
Just understand and enjoy what you've found
And listen to it as long as your heart hears the sound of love?

?There ain't nothin' quite like it in the world anybody knows of""
So there I was, all through my teens
Same little boy with his strong young arms lovin' me
I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Ooh, it like to drove me crazy and I remember sayin'
""I never felt nothin' like this""

And I remember sayin' to momma, ""I know just what you mean
I'm in love and that's every little girl's dream
What I found is every little girl's dream""

And I found mine and momma said
""Me too, baby, once upon a time
Lifts you up, it lets you down
There'll be another dream to bring you back around

There's somethin' about the first time
That keeps you rememberin'

Lisa Brokop,"I caught you glancing in a pawn shop window,
You caught me looking there too.
Just a little quarter-carat diamond,
But it was sparkling true.
I could see you were a little uneasy,
You said: ""We're running late.""
And later on, parked over in my driveway,
Said: ""Boy, you're gonna have to wait.
""If you really want to be my baby,
""I really want you to be mine, all mine.
""If you want to talk about forever, 
""That's what's on my mind.

Gentle roses and sweet perfume.
I was thrilled the first time you kissed me.
But just a little too soon.
Where I come from, love stands for something.
And it's worth the wait.

And by the time the thunder rolled in I reached for you and you were gone
I guess I barely got to know you, guess I hardly know myself
I still have some things here for you that I can't give to no one else

Never did say goodbye
I never did tell you how you changed my life
About the time you came along
We got caught out in a storm and I got lost without your light

Now every time they call for rain
I reach out to touch the sky
Maybe I'll see you again
Maybe that's the reason why you never said goodbye

I get so tired of pretending that you never flew away
Seems like I'm always defending myself and how I think of you this way
If I can see you in my mirror then maybe you can see me too
On a sunny day I'm feeling better, on a cloudy day I look for you

Never did say goodbye
I never did tell you how you changed my life
About the time you came along

Not while you're here with me

But I can only go so far

And you need somewhere to cry
But not here in my arms

I can give you love I can give you time
But I can't give you all that's in my heart

And we stayed up yellin' at each other till late last night

Who needs you stealing my covers, taking up half the bed

He pours the red wine in her glass. 
On the other side of the same city,
A man sits alone in his room.
Constantly tortured by memories,
He's putting the bourbon to use.

A bridge wrapped in flames,
Or soft candle light. 
One's for: ""I love you.""
One's for: ""Its over. Goodbye.""

Between whiskey and wine.
Now the lovers, they savour each moment, 
Not wanting the evening to end.
While the lonely man prays in the silence,

I don't iron my baby's shirts,
He likes it when I wear them
Sometimes I come home from work
And He's already there
We might just head for sandy shores
Some random afternoon
The laundry won't get done
The bookshelves won't get dusted

Over analyzin' this and that
Choke when it's my turn to bat

Feelin' like every thing I need
There's so many possibilities
If I just take the chance

What if there's a touch
That calms my deepest fears
A sunset on an ocean pier
Where we tell each other our life stories
All night long until it's morning
What if there's a moment sayin'
Dance, though there's no music playin'
And a perfect blue sky backdrop, for a kiss
Is that what I'd miss?

Let you get into my heart and soul
The other part it just don't know
'Cause theres alot to lose
I could give all my everything
No there's nothin' that you wouldn't see
And it could turn out that you don't love me
Like I love you

What if there's a house with roses
And a trellis
A yard that makes the neighbors jealous
We're on the front porch holdin' hands
Makin' all our future plans
Family pictures on the mantle
Christmas trees and Roman candles
Take out menus and weekly grocery lists
Is that what I'd miss?

What if there's a little girl
With your blue eyes
A wall that marks just how time flies
One minute bouncin' on my knee
Next she's askin' for the keys
Maybe I should just surrender
To the hope of things we might remember
I'll tell my heart I think it's worth the risk

Lisa Brokop,"I wanna live like a wildflower,
Find my place in the golden sun.
Sittin' on the banks of the Okeechobee,
Watchin' that river run.

Where's that girl who ran barefoot,
Chasin' the wind and the butterflies?
Tellin' her secrets to the calico cat:
That cat never heard no lies.

Grandma's apron full of blackberries,
Sayin': ""Get your bucket and a-come home child.
""Wash your hands it's time for supper.
""Clean your face but don't touch that smile.""
Kiss on the cheek and off to bed:

Run, run, river run.
Watchin' that river run.

Where's that girl who laid in the daisies,
Lookin' at the faces up in the clouds?
Dreamin' of the boy she's gonna marry.
Where's that boy right now?
Come on, honey, go with me,
To the boy and the girl we used to be.
I pray, the Lord, our souls to keep:
Lord, keep our spirits free.

We're gonna live like wildflowers:
Nature's daughter, nature's son.

Dancin' at the feet of the Father's son.

suddenly turn and see

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some like the bop-type refrain
I'm sure that if, I heard even one riff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane

Is my idea of nothing to do

Is it wise to be cold, to struggle, to hold back with tears
If you could only see the girl
They call the lonely one
You'd know that since you're gone
The lonely one is me

",The Lonely One
Lisa Ekdahl,"There was a boy,
A very small enchated boy.
They say he wandered very far, very far,
Over land and sea.
A little shy and sad of eye,
But very wise was he.

And then one day.
One magic day he came my way.
And as we spoke of many things,
Fools and kings,
This he said to me.
The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return.



",Nature Boy
Lisa Ekdahl,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drop of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
There's no matter darling where you are
I think of you night and day,

Night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day,

Night and day Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Til you let me spend my life
making love to you

Lisa Ekdahl,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

: I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
What is this thing called love? :",What Is This Thing Called Love?
Lisa Ekdahl,"Blue is the color of love
When your lover has gone from you
Your heart is filled with longing to have new
What came once from others

When you open your heart for two
But now it's true and you realize
What illusion can do
If you close your eyes
But the dreaming is over now

So blue is the color of you
When you're waiting for someone who
Will always make your dreams come true

But now it's true and you realize
What illusion can do
If you close your eyes
But the dreaming is over now

So blue is the color of you
When you're waiting for someone who
Will always make your dreams come true



",The Color of You
Lisa Ekdahl,"How many more times must I cry
How many more times must I say goodbye
To you
I've opened all the way
For you
It's always just someday

How many more times must I try
How many more times must I lay down and die
For you
I'd lose mountains
And blue skies
But I can't help losing my mind for you
How many more times

I'd lose mountains
And blue skies
But I can't help losing my mind for you
How many more times



",How Many More Times
Lisa Ekdahl,"I don't miss you anymore
Unless the moonlight's great
Or on a starry night
I just might miss you
A little bit

I don't miss you anymore
Unless it's a cloudy day
Or if the sun shines bright
I just might miss you
Now and then

I don't miss you
'Till the morning fills the air
Or the afternoon is fair
Or the evening light is barely there

I don't miss you
And you know is not a lie
Unless the moon is floating
High above
A perfect midnight sky

I don't miss you
'Till the morning fills the air
Or the afternoon is fair
Or the evening light is barely there

I don't miss you
And you know is not a lie
Unless the moon is floating
High above
A perfect midnight sky

I don't miss you anymore
Unless I close my eyes
Especially open wide
I see
I miss you every day



",I Don't Miss You Anymore
Lisa Ekdahl,"If the sun
Refused to shine
Down on me
'Till the end of time
As long as I have your caress
Your tenderness
I will be blessed

If the stars
Refused their light
Just for me
They stayed out of sight
If you say you love me best
I won't care less
I will be blessed

If the wind won't blow your name
Until I'm still
I will
If it's whispered from above
The highest hill
I will

If the moon
Up in the sky
Turned its face
From the lonely eye
I could never be distressed
Or love you less
I will be blessed



",I Will Be Blessed
Lisa Ekdahl,"I've seen a million works of art
But nothing on canvas
Can capture my heart
I'm looking for something
Even Rembrandt couldn't do
I've never seen anything like you

I have a million photographs
Of sages and saints
But thre's something they lack
Now I see something
Even God would approuve
I've never seen anything like you

Now you could say my mind is gone
But I know it isn't true
Now I could carry on and on all day
In praise of you

I've seen the stars up in the sky
Like angels from heaven
Or a tear in my eye
But they don't shine brighter
Than the light you're shinin' through
I've never seen anything like you



",I've Never Seen Anything Like You
Lisa Ekdahl,"If a bird sat down upon my shoulder
Would I know if it's a sparrow?
Just as well now it could be a nightingale

If I had the wealth of all the universe
Would I be a Pharaoh?
Just as well now I could use my
Might to sail away

I know everything seems so real
I know we're on a spinning wheel
I know it wuold be so nice
Almost paradise
If you and I just sit together

If you listen close enough
My song will hit you surer than an arrow
Then you'll hear me singing like a
Nightingale at play
At play



",Nightingale
Lisa Ekdahl,"Tonight I'll drown
In the eye of my lover
If I empty my hands
I'll hold everything

I've given up my will
Now you can take it all from me
Or you can leave me
Drowing in a wave of my conceit

Tonight I'll crash
On the ground of my lover
If I give up my soul
I'll be everything

I've climbed the highest hills
And traveled all the distant seas
But that just leaves me
Broken on the ground of my conceit

There's a secret so deep
Opened up from a day
When there's nothing to keep
And there's nothing to let fall away

Tonight I'll burn
In the flame of my lover
If I give you my heart
I'll be everything

I died for all the thrills
But always wound up on my knees
That's where you'll see me
Burning in the fire of my conceit.



",Of My Conceit
Lisa Ekdahl,"Only you
Can make me feel
The world can disappear

Only you
Make my heart heal
And make it oh so clear

We can talk in circles
Going round in a million ways
And never understand

'Cause our words are whispers
Hidden up in a distant haze
Like diamonds next to sand

I don't even know
What it's all about
But I get all blissed out
And then I know
It's only you



",Only You
Lisa Ekdahl,"Unapproachable I stare
For you my anguished heart despairs
There's nothing but sadness in the air
I reach out for you but you're not here
Or anywhere
Just sorrow left to bear

Unavoidable you say
There's too much pain for you to stay
And nothing we had remains the same
They say that everything must change

Even so
We can always start
Over from zero
And we'll be closer than
The rhythum of our hearts



",The Rhythm of Our Hearts
Lisa Ekdahl,"This night
I awoke
Out from dreams
Of tall cascading fontains
Of love
I'm floating like a dove
Covered from above
With fountains of love

And you
Fly with me
Through a scene
Of deep caressing rivers
Of love
Soft as a dove
It's you I'm dreaming of
With rivers of love

Flowing from above
Knowing only of
Rivers of love



",Rivers of Love
Lisa Ekdahl,"In the silence of my mind
I can see our love was just a line
To a grasp of air
That's nowhere

And while I wait for love's embrace
My life is but a race
Since you're gone now
All my light is left to waste

I never learned the rule
That love can be so cruel
When it's over and done
Now I can't believe
That what they say is true
How love can be renewed
Because once it's abused
Then it's through

There's no laughter in your smile
And all that's left are shadows in my mind
Of a different place
And your face

And in the quiet of my heart
The sadness lingers on
Now I just have a different point of view
Since you've been gone



",Since You've Been Gone
Lisa Ekdahl,"The sun rose
And I awakened
Covered up in flames
I was lost
Like anyone knows
How I was shaken
Fallin' from in pain
I was almost blind
My hands entwined
But suddenly the
Sun rose right before my eyes
I can't believe that I
Could feel the way I do
I can't believe it's true
It's you and only you

The sun rose
In such an hazy
Sky this morning
I though
My soul
Would fly away
When it was
Just barely
High and dawning
I though I almost died
My hands were tied
But suddenly the
Sun rose right before my eyes
I can't believe that I
Could feel the way I do
I can't believe it's true
It's you and only you




",Sun Rose
Lisa Ekdahl,"Sunny weather
Tastes much less sweeter
Since you went away
Sunny weather ain't no sunny anymore

Sunny weather
Seemed so much brighter
Now colors just fade
Sunny weather ain't no sunny anymore

All day
Rain falls
And I'll fall like a feather
'Till I can kiss you once again

This sunny weather
Feels colder than winter
My heart's turned to snow
Since you had to go
Sunny weather ain't no sunny anymore

For the strength to stay away

When I know your coming back again
How can I ease the pain in my heart
How can I ease the pain

Everytime that I let you in
You take away something deep within
A fool for love is a fool for pain
But I refuse to love you again

Tell me baby why you're here

Lisa Fischer,"Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

People used to laugh at me when I was a little girl
I guess they didn't understand
But when you're young and all alone
You make up things for the things that are missing
Ooh, how I used to love to dress up in my Mother's clothes
It made me feel like somebody
I'd pretend I was the prettiest girl at the dance
And all the boys loved me
And I was gonna be a big success
But of course I never got that dress for my very own
I didn't do half the things I thought I'd do
But I guess the good part of my life is that I did find you
And you know
Now when I look into a little girl's eyes
It's like a mirror
And I remember, I remember

She's faced the hardest times
You could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her little shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears
And the sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight's silence in, in her ears

Let her cry, she is a lady
Let her dream, she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

Be careful how you touch her
For she will wake up
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you see life through her eyes
You won't believe
The way she's always paying
For a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear, it's all she knows

Let her cry, oh my, cause she's a lady
Let her sing, sing, cause she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a sweet and gentle flower, growing wild

And if by chance you get to hold her
Hold her for a time
And with your new possession, what would you do
I would pick her up from the garden, to be mine

Each time her little shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears
And the sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight's silence in, in her ears

Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her sing for she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her

She's a sweet and gentle flower, growing wild

Far away from here

I could do about anything
Great excuses make it easier to forget 
That awful feeling
So smile real big, oh precious moment
In this vague world full of fantasy like my man
Could it be he takes me there 
Anywhere far away from here
Far away from here, 
Far away from here, 
Far away from here
I could do about anything.",Stars [Album Version]
Lisa Germano,"How can I say?
I lost my head
It was in the waste basket
When I found it I'd give anything
To change the words the words the words that come out of it
We all do it
We make mistakes and make some more and then some
But only as much as we feel
And the way the way is soon forgiveness
Eyes are open
Can I really believe what I see?

Love is everywhere and I could have it
Love is everywhere and I could have it
If I see it
What a waste
What a waste to feel the way I feel
While happiness is just around the corner
'Cause happiness is just around the corner from forgiveness
Once around the world
Could I feel my way around the world
Twice around the world
Feel my way around

Okay okay
Nobody teaches how to laugh
Nobody teaches how to live
Nobody told me what to do
When life gets pretty ugly
What a waste
What a waste to feel the way I feel
While happiness is just around the corner

And love is everywhere if I could have it
If I see it
Once around the world
Twice around the world
I gotta feel my way around the world
Feel my way around
I gotta gotta feel
I gotta feel my way around
Gotta gotta feel
Gotta feel gotta feel gotta feel
Gotta gotta feel
Around my world

But it's not

The sun will come out 
The day after tomorrow..haha
And you can move on 
To another bad day
You wish you were pretty, 
But you're not

But your baby loves you, 
He tells you so all the time
Oh that must be why 
You're so happy together
You're having another bad day 
And that's all you could change
But you don't, 
But your attitude, baby 
Doesn't have to be so sad
You wish you were happy 
But you're not

But if life was easy 
You wouldn't learn anything, 
Now would you?
But most of the lessons you learn 
You would rather forget
You wish you could laugh it away 
But its hard
A smoke or a drink makes 
The laughing part easier, 

But now you are stuck 
With another addiction
You're having another bad day 
And that's all you could change
You could change 
But you're attitude, baby 
Doesn't have to be so mad
If you were just younger, 

Or, you could start over, 
It's never too late, 
That's what Betty says
Whatever happened 
To your sense of humor?
You've had all your treats 
And its only 8:30 am 
That's am you would
Give anything to change back

To when
The waves
Were smaller
And you could jump
Over
Change back
To when you laughed
Easy
And all your moves
Were childlike",Bad Attitude

Lisa Germano,"After the storm
After you're gone
Where are my arms?
Where is my arm?

After our love
Needy and strong
Falls on the floor
Dirty and wrong

After your voice
Cuts through my chest
How can I stand
To hear again?

After our love
Deeper than deep
Severs the soul
How can I be?

After I feel
What I feared most
After the storm
Where are my arms?

After the storm
Where are my hands?
How can I touch
Without my hands?

We always knew
Long before storms
Ever came through

No you in the middle of the night

As I rest until tomorrow

I'll remember them
In, out, over
It's not possible

No color here

All my mistakes woven in a rug
Black, blue and dusty
Is there a beauty there?
Reach, reach, reach
I'll be reaching now

Is there an angel here?

Rest until tomorrow

Someday someone

No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

Lisa Kirchner,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Lisa Kirchner,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Lisa Kirchner,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

The only difference is you're down there.
I'm looking through you, 
Any other way. 

Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight. 

I'm looking through you, 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you, 
What did I know?
You don't look different, 
But you have changed.

So easy?
Well, there's something I want you to know

If you love something just set it free
And know that
If it comes back then it's meant to be
I'm still hoping

I'm gonna love you forever
I'm gonna be here for awhile
'Til I see your smiling face again
It's just a matter of when
So until then I'll be right here waiting

I could fall in love with you 
I could fall in love with you 

I can only wonder how 
Touching you would make me feel 
But if I take that chance right now 
Tomorrow will you want me still

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart? That beat in my heart, that beat

[Incomprehensible]

It's like trying to touch the sky but overlook the sun
That's why reality keeps telling me that you're the one
Just the very thought of you gets me aroused
I can feel my heart beat right through my blouse

And darling I tried not to show now I don't know what to do
I tell myself that I'm lying so let's just not let it go
My heart does double beats for you, baby
And I hope you feel the same 'cause I do know for sure, baby
That sure as my name oh baby I know that you're the cure

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part

That beat, that beat, that beat, that beat
That beat, that beat, that beat
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?

I can run you say I'm here and this is my idea to care
Well I do myself care that make you feel that you're still there
[Incomprehensible]
But I want to do is just ask you, tell me can you feel the beat?

Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Well, can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat? Talk to me

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love
We've ever been to my heart, ever been to my heart, yeah
Oh my love we've ever been to my heart, ever been to my heart
And love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love

You change your shoelaces. 
I light firecrackers. 
Spend time alone, find a stick in the basement. 

Drink water and gold dust and die of impatience. 
Electric like static, and no need to speak. 
It's not right, but it's not wrong. 
So I wrote this song. 

I wrote this song - is that what you want. 
You got what you want - does it make you feel better? 
With a smirk on your face and a gun at my head, 
You come to my place and ask to be fed. 

You change your shoelaces. 
I light firecrackers. 
You step on the sparks. 
You change your shoelaces. 

I light firecrackers. 
You get in the way. 
You get in the way. 
You want to suffer and show me you're angry. 

Fight with your fists up or call for your mommy. 
You want to suffer and show me you're angry.",Firecracker

""It makes my heart heavy  you're lonely  I think. 
Oh  Rose  you're sad  I suppose."" 
""Look in her bed and she's bound to be sleeping. 
She's lying there dead.   No  she's breathing."" 
Furious Rose  with your opiate eyes  
Your languorous hum  that tone of surprise 
I've heard energy in adversity. 
Your smile: the soul of witchery. 
You're not running away, 
You're not running, are you? 
Lyrically longing, she's tearing the words from the page. 
She's fearfully seething. 
""Bring me your blessings, a prayer, or a new pen. 
You don't know what I need."" 
""Look in my bed and I'm bound to be sleeping, 
I'm lying there dead, but I'm breathing. 
And I'm barely balancing as it is, 
And I don't want to drown in my dreams 
Bring me wild plums and acrimony 
I bet you don't even know what that means.""

Lisa Loeb,"I didn't come this far for you to make this hard for me.
And now you want to ask me ""how""?
It's like how does your heart beat and why do you breathe?
How does your heart beat and why do you breathe?
Why did you come here?
You weren't invited.
You were on the outside
Stay on the outside.
And now you want to ask me ""why""?
It's like why does your heart beat and how do you cry?
How does your heart beat?
And there are some things that I'd like to figure out.
There are some things that I can do without
Like you, and your letters that go on forever,
And you, and the people that were never friends.
With all the things that you could be,
You never could learn how to be me.
And now you want to ask me ""how""?

Some things don't need a payback. some things are sure But the answers I find, aren't what you want to hear. they're not even close. Some things you can' t feel safe about. Some things don't need a clear up. You got that? I remember good things like the van breaking down. I sat on your lap in the auto repair and you touched my hair. While the heavy drops rain on the pavement outside. Don't take revenge. just let it lie. Don't give me a chance. You don't owe me that. The easiest thing, is if you just let it die. Some things you can't feel safe about. Some things don't need a payback. some things are sure Don't follow me out, I'll think your coming for some payback Why did I leave? How long did it take?

At the toast and the butter

She gets home from school too early
And closes the door to her room
There's nothing inside her
She's weak and she's tired of feeling like this

And they rise in the morning
And they sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking
She's falling apart

They call her for dinner, she makes up a reason
She looks at her arms and she rolls down her sleeves
And her mother is starting to see through her lies
And last night her father had tears in his eyes

Only I was talking, only I was talking.
Is this a future disaster? -Full of omens?

Play guitar like a rock and roll star
Sing along while the record played
'round and 'round and 'round

Back home, all alone
And it makes me sad, cause now you won't
Take me out, make me laugh
Never say now I want to go
Back home, all alone
And it makes me sad, cause now you won't
Let me go
If I'm the one you're holding on to
Let me go
Cause after all this time I know that I'm the one who can't let go.
Take me out, make me laugh

Back home, all alone
And it makes me sad, cause now you won't

Hanging out in the parking lot like the day would never end.

Lisa Loeb,"Diamonds are a ritual 
A prize in a cracker jack 
A name that you won't get back 
Diamonds are a run around 
A game you can't win 
While you wait for your life to begin 

Miss the party 
Drink the punch 
The drunk ones are the lucky bunch 

Diamonds play single 
So sharp and abbrasive 
Just look at their poor faces 
It's sad 
It's not in the cards for them 
Look down at their hands 
You'll see nothing but emptiness and misery 

Miss the party 
Drink the punch 
The drunk ones are the lucky bunch 
Drink til' they can't tell what's wrong 
Drink til' they can't tell what's wrong 

Diamonds are a piece of twine 
A seal on the envelope 
Some guarantee of hope 
Diamonds are just rocks that shine 
So I'm not the diamond kind 
I'll never see a diamond mine 

Miss the party 
Drink the punch 
The drunk ones are the lucky bunch 
'cause they can't remember when they've had such a bad time 
No they can't remember when they've had such a bad time 
They can't remember when they've had such a bad time

Lisa Loeb,"I know we're in September 
And this is my house 
And this is my town 
But my clothes are in the case 
And I am leaving 
Don't tell me what you spent it on 
You always lie

And it's a decision 
I am leaving 

We used to say for fun 
Lets say you lived 
And then you did 
You were the leader of us all 
The perfect fall 

You speak to the weak and old picture of me 
Everybody says they wanna be free 
And it's a decision 
So I am leaving 

The powder's in the kitchen 
The spoon is on the floor 
Your sister says it's different now 
I don't believe her anymore 

[Chorus]
And I don't want your hand me downs 
They're old 
They're all worn out 
I don't wanna hang around 
I don't want your hand me downs 

So now I'm in this hotel room 
I'm free and droning on 
But the musics way too loud 
I wanna skip to the next song 

The glass is on the counter 
The sheets are on the floor 
Your sister says it's not the same 
I don't believe her anymore

So you lie yourself to sleep tonight 
But you won't think of me 
'cause your world revolves around you 
Or so it seems 
Or so it seems 
And you can't get off 
And I can't get on 
Yourself is all you see 
And I don't wanna hang around

Your girlfriend never smiles, no one ever calls.
You begin to wonder if they were your friends at all.
You frown, you take a look around.
You shout, this'll never get better.

Turning your field into a deeper valley

It's just a little mess, your dreams aren't shattered

Lisa Loeb,"Days were different when you counted them in hours.
There were some things that she never wanted again.
In fragmented words, too weak to hear,
There were some things that she never wanted again.
Like: do you want to be the man she once knew?
Do you want to be the woman she knew too.
Days were different when you counted them in hours.
There were some things that she never wanted again.
Like, she won't talk of blocks, and of time,
And of clocks and how they bind.
And the days that have passed so fast that you might
Bring the past to the present, and say it is your future life.
I'm waking up from a bed of past lives lived,
'cause I'm living my life 'half-life, half-lived.'

And with some help from you they become dependant.

They always trust you but they're dying out.

It blows my mind. 
There's a doctor on every campus now. 
And he's gonna tell you what you're feeling. 
Momma wants you to swallow this down. 
It's gonna make you sit still and listen. 

I'm sorry, children, you don't have the choice. 
Your parents gave you something way back when. 
There's nothing wrong with you; 
It's easier to give you this. 
Then you won't embarrass them. 
When there's something wrong, take an antidepressant. You can even choose which kind you want by the latest suicide.

Don’t get hung up here
Let’s forgive each other
You can move on dear

Too many sins for confession

And all the spiders, they spin their webs

Of all the colors that you knew they had
But you wanted to ignore

Don’t get hung up here
I will always love you

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Leave me in the midnight sun

A memory, a wildered rose
My summer dream my winter ghost

I saw someone on the ice today
Leave me, winter's on the run
Ice break, all of this will melt away
Leave me in the midnight sun",Midnight Sun
Lisa Miskovsky,"When I came there, I was dressed in blues
Watched her dancing, without no shoes
I couldn't help it but I was feeling down
Wanted her to disappear when I led her down

She's your angel, she's your altitude
And I'm a broken, lady
And I act way too, way too rude

In another life, oh, what a strange excuse
I'm left here all alone, well, well, well, well, I'm still having fun
When nothing matters, something changes inside
My eyes cried a thousand tears, my arms were open wide

'Cause you don't love me
Oh how I wanted you
It's always that extra hand
That will pull you, will pull you through
",One Dark Night
Lisa Miskovsky,"Caught your eyes across the cantina floor
Hiding my smile when you passed through the door
We were young, only seventeen
Driving around in your daddy's dream

And I was your angel, 
Oh baby, you were my king
And we had coins in our pockets, 
And we had songs to sing
And I had my mom's dress, 
No wedding ring
We walked down at the valley 
But I couldn't hear your restless heart

You're always working, 
Always running late
So, I eat my dinner 
And watch the show that you hate
Oh, how can you spark, 
When I burn so bright
And how can I breathe 
When you will not fight

Love is like gold, 
You just have to dig deep
It's not a diamond, 
It's cool and it won't work with greed
At the end of the rainbow, 
Your dreams come apart",Restless Heart
Lisa Miskovsky,"I'm gonna leave the planet burning
I'm gonna drive the fastest car
I'm gonna teach them while you're learning
I'm gonna take it very far

I'm gonna ride the steepest mountain
I'm gonna travel to the moon
I'm gonna swim the deepest ocean
I'm gonna leave the planet soon

Sing to me, why won't you sing to me
Why won't you sing like you did, 
A long, long time ago?
It was such a long, long time ago

It's not a question of devotion
You cannot carve your own tattoo
I'm not a part of your emotion
You can't tell me what to do

I'm gonna star the greatest movie
I'm gonna write the perfect song
I'm gonna make it through the wires
I'm gonna make it all alone

Sing to me, why you sing to me
Why won't you sing like you did, 
A long, long time ago?

You fall easy, 
But it's easy to give in when you fall
Oh, and you fall easy
But it's easy to give in when the rain falls

Why won't you sing like you did,

Sing to me, why won't you sing to me
Why won't you sing like you did, 
A long, long time ago?

You've got to sing
You never sing like you did before
You used to sing
You've got to sing like you did before

You never sing
You've got to sing like you did before
You never sing, like you did before
Like you did before, 
Like you did before

I've got a hole in my heart, 
I see darkness ahead
I've got a whole lot of living 
To do before I left
There's a hole in my heart, 
It was something you said
You've got a whole lot of nothing 
In that pretty little head",Sing to Me
Lisa Miskovsky,"The rain is falling, it's close to midnight
You say, I love you

I hold my breath then, down by that streetlight
I lie, I love you too

You have your sweet dreams, my darling
I've got a head full of stories, 
I won't tell

Maybe I can save you from this darkness, baby
But I just can't save you from yourself

Let's save some time dear, this poisoned sky
Clearly has got a hold of me

I liked your smile dear, 
Don't let it die here
Now, close your eyes and sleep

Lisa Miskovsky,"I was lost, a new beginning
I could hear the bells were ringing
Waiting, I was waiting

The sun was clouded
Changing I was changing

Said but I was smart or clever
You said

(If only for a little while)
Come and take me by the hand
Mm
Come and take me by the hand
(I only wanna make you smile)
So come and take me by the hand

And suddenly my heart was aching
I could feel the ice all breaking
Smiling, I was smiling
The birds were singing hallelujah
But you don't really listen like you used to
Cause now you're used to
And now when every song has faded
Feeling blue you're feeling jaded
Lost

Come and take me by the hand
(If only for a little while)
Come and take me by the hand

Lisa Miskovsky,"Once was lost, now it?s over
I greet the morning, I believe it was the light
Once was lost, now it?s over, without a warning
I believe it was the night

?Cause I feel so lost when you're mine
You can no longer give you that sign
?Cause you dance just like me, yeah
Just like me

I can't see ?cause I'm blinded with the ocean
That you once gave to me
Why can't I be alone, I get a notion
That it wasn't meant to be

But it?s easy to see when you're blind
You can hear me when I make that sound
?Cause you dance just like me, yeah
Just like me

You can see with no eyes
You can feel the wind blow
Through the streets with no lights

When you feel that you're over and out
When you need someone there through the night
I can guide you through fire and ice

Lisa Miskovsky,"Main street's empty in the evening chill
From courthouse tower to griffin mill
Small signs of winter come creeping down the hills

I saw your shadow on Jackson St.
Where the zombie-eyed kids 
And the speed-queens meet
It's been a long time running 
Through my veins this long lost dream

And I tear it apart 
And burn it all down 'cause I have to
God gave me permission to do what it takes to find you

All the friends I betrayed 
All the enemies made in the process
We've all done the same 
We're just carrying different crosses
I'm feeling no pain baby, 
It's acceptable losses

This place got dark in the year's that passed
The store-fronts blown I guess nothing lasts
The fighting at the bars 
Still draw wired vengeful crowds

I fallowed our trail down to Rosewood Park
As the shadows grow tall and the stars come out
Were the backseat lovers used to park their daddy's car

And I tear it apart 
And burn it all down 'cause I have to
Made a deal with a man at the crossroads 
Who knew where to find you

All the friends I betrayed 
All the enemies made in the process
Our pain feels the same 
We're just carrying different crosses
It's all in the game baby, 
It's acceptable losses

They found your car own at Suicide Brigde
Where the Johnson twins became newsflash kids
But I know you so much better 
Don't believe you'd call it quits

Now I got an old address and I'm waiting there
In the first light of morning at the fire stairs
I can hear someone's something and suddenly I'm scared

'Cause you ripped me apart 
And I ran for my life 'cause I had to
My heart won't stop bleeding 
And I'm no longer sure if I want it to

Lisa Miskovsky,"Let's begin where the story ends
I'll try to explain how I lost my friends
I didn't stop when I knew I should
I've got nothing now, it's gone for good

I guess they want me dead, 
A bounty on my head
I say just let them come, 
Yeah bring them on
Are you listening now, 
Can I get through somehow
I've been waiting for so long
This is last year's song

It all began in this prayed up town 
(You were looking for a way out, 
Love strapped you down)
I turned and ran as we were taking our vows
It sure is hard to run in a wedding gown

So I stole your car, 
And ran it through your heart
And the radio was on, 
Playing last year's song
And if you're listening now, 
Can I get through somehow
You know I never did you wrong
That was last year's song

I heard you fell in love again 
(with what's her name)
She used to be my friend 
(not anymore)
I hope you'll make it in the end, 
I'm free now

No I'm not afraid now, 
No, no, no I'm not afraid now
Yeah I'm on my way now 
And I got through somehow

If you're listening now, 
I bet you hear that sound
Of the preacher's raging on, 
Banning last year's song

Are you listening now, 
Did I get through somehow
When you're finally catching on, 
Then I'm gone, like last year's song

I'm not afraid now
It's gone away now, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
You're on your way now
It is New Year's Day now
And I got through somehow",Last Year's Song
Lisa Miskovsky,"Oh my little bird
What have you done
You fell in love with
Mister setting sun
So beautiful he made the sky
Your own
Then he disappeared
Left you alone

You sang your song
You searched the blackened sky
You searched the stars
You lost your will to fly
Then the rain came
Pouring from a cloud
You begged the wind for mercy
Blown out loud

Can you hear it?
Can you hear it too?
Can you hear it?
Can you hear it too?
I know you fear it
I am here with you now

The wind was moving
Fog was moving closer
Clouds were turning raindrops
Into sleet
See this twilight bake the plains
Shadows leaving with no names
You're burning with the fear
I can feel
You're burning with a fear
That is me

Little bird you came
A bit too close
It's hard to reach the one
You love the most

There's always a setting sun

Laugh

Settle down, never understood
The ground beneath you

You trembled when he spoke, I
Think you choked but I'm still
Alive

Said it all before, I know the
Score but waiting is a fire on
Hold

I feel so much greater than you
I see so much more than you do

And I'm here eating it all then I
Leave quietly

Never gonna see, never gonna
Be, that smile on your face

And silently left him to bleed

The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me

To the rhythm of the rhythm of a tap-a-tap-tap

Cause he fell down a pavement crack, down a pavement crack

I have nowhere I'll have time

There are no legible signs

I like the way that you walk

You're not in the room

You order champagne
I'm missing a date by hours

How could I live without you
When I'm feeling this way
I'm so happy that I found you
Love you more every day

You treat me so tender
With diamonds and furs
But if choosing a gift or sender
I give up the purse
Choose situation
Too me you're the one
Every day is a celebration
You're my love you're my inspiration

Lisa Nilsson,"Jag känner dig, jag känner dig så väl. 
Dina fasor, dina våndor finns också i min själ.
Du är mitt kött och blod. 
Det bär ett dyrbart namn, det är min kärlek utan villkor.
Jag gör vad jag kan.
Så stor och stark på dagen, men så liten mitt i natten,
när ingen ser, när ingen vet, kommer gråten mitt i skrattet.

Fem fingrar ska skydda dig.
Ett är månen, ett är solen, ett är polstjärnan bakom molnen.
Ett är hopp och ett är tro.
Handens fem fingrar vaggar dig till ro.

Hmmm...

Stort är mörkret nu. 
Månen är itu,
men det är natten som gör dagen ljus och mitt ljus är du.
Och denna jord är rund,
finns här ingen annan som kan ge mig sån förtvivlan?
Och som är lika sann.
Du blir rädd för dina skuggor,
alla hot som aldrig når dig.
jag ska sjunga dig ett löfte,
och jag vet att du förstår mig.

Fem fingrar ska skydda dig.
Ett är månen, ett är solen, ett är polstjärnan bakom molnen.
Ett är hopp och ett är tro.
Handens fem fingrar vaggar dig till ro.

Om du tänker dig den skogsväg,
vi vandrar ibland,
gick vi stigen ner till vattnet.
Din hand är i min hand.
Se så långt där ner i djupet,
på botten av den sjön,
där finns en silverskatt som glimmar,
den är din inatt.
Så slumra in och dröm.

Fem fingrar ska skydda dig.
Ett är månen, ett är solen, ett är polstjärnan bakom molnen.
Ett är hopp och ett är tro.
Handens fem fingrar vaggar dig till ro.
Handens fem fingrar vaggar dig till ro.

Lisa O'Kane,"When Daddy told me what happened 
I couldn't believe what he just said
Sonny shot himself with a 44 
And they found him lyin' on his bed
I could not speak a single word 
No tears streamed down my face
I just sat there on the living room couch 
Starin' off into space
Mama and Daddy went over to the house 
To see what had to be done
They took the sheets off of the bed 
And they went to call someone
Some of us gathered at a friend's house 
To help each other ease the pain
I just sat alone in a corner chair 
I couldn't say much of anything
We drove on out to the country
His friends all stood around
Subiaco Cemetery 
Is where we lay him down
I saw his mama, she was standin' there 
His sister, she was there too
I saw them look at us standin' around the grave 
And not a soul they knew
Born and raised in Pineola 
His mama believed in the Pentecost
She got the preacher to say some words 
So his soul wouldn't be lost
Some of us, we stood in silence 
Some bowed their heads and prayed
I think I must've picked up a handful of dust 
And let it fall over his grave
I think I must've picked up a handful of dust 
And let it fall over his grave",Pineola

The sun comes up each morning
Sometimes tomorrow falls on us
Without any warning
If the day I see
Is not the day I thought it would be
Sometimes I laugh out loud
For all the things that are possible now

Not without hope
Not without faith 	
Not without taking heart
Not without accepting grace
Not without love
Can we do the things we’ve done
Can we find the strength to go on
Not without hope
Not without hope

Some say that we are blessed
Every instant God is watching
No matter where we think we are
Our souls are still touching
Whatever may befall
We know He is looking after us all
Sometimes I laugh out loud
For all the things that are possible now

Not without hope
Not without faith 	
Not without taking heart
Not without accepting grace
Not without love
Can we do the things we’ve done
Can we find the strength to go on
Not without hope

We don’t learn the simplest lessons

We look for love and search the heavens
We seek the truth we feel so helpless

Lisa Pressman,"When hope makes a wish it's wrapped in God's Love 
And in the abundance of this love there is more than enough 
In our hearts we feel inspired for love to shine through
When hope makes a wish every wish comes true 

When faith says a prayer for all humankind
A prayer to unite us in our hearts in a joy that’s Divine
When we’re given grace it’s for everyone to receive
When hope makes a wish we can all believe 

Do we stand in awe like a child reaching for God’s hand
Do we search our thoughts in wonder of the wisdom of God's plan 
Now we can start to open our hearts to the mystery that only God understands 
How else can we cope          
God has given us Hope    

When love has a dream it helps us to see 
A vision of everything we are and of what we can be 
In the light of love God sees us as pure as joyous souls
When hope makes a wish God smiles down on us all 
When hope makes a wish God smiles down on us all",When Hope Makes a Wish [Instrumental]

When your thoughts are quiet for a moment
At the point where light begins

When they flow right through you
When the spirits move you

Just to be a dancer
Like the angels hidden in the starlight
You can search for the unknown

To walk in the mystery
To take your place within the journey

When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you

I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You)
Lisa Richard,"What's going on around me
Is barely making sense
I need some explanations fast
I see my present partner
In the imperfect tense
And I don't see how we can last
I feel I need a change of cast
Maybe I'm on nobody's side.

And when he gives me reasons
To justify each move
They're getting harder to believe
I know this can't continue
I've still a lot to prove
There must be more I could achieve
But I don't have the nerve to leave.

Everybody's playing the game
But nobody's rules are the same
Nobody's on nobody's side
Better learn to go it alone
Recognize you're out on your own
Nobody's on nobody's side.

The one I should not think of
Keeps rolling through my mind
And I don't want to let that go
No lovers ever faithful
No contract truly signed
There's nothing certain left to know
And how the cracks begin to show!

Never make a promise or plan
Take a little love where you can
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never stay too long in your bed
Never lose your heart, use your head
Nobody's on nobody's side.

Never take a stranger's advice
Never let a friend fool you twice
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never be the first to believe
Never be the last to deceive
Nobody's on nobody's side
And never leave a moment too soon
Never waste a hot afternoon
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never stay a minute too long
Don't forget the best will go wrong
Nobody's on nobody's side.

Better learn to go it alone
Recognize you're out on your own

but I'll never know by living, only my dying will tell, 
only my dying will tell, yeah, only my dying will tell. 
And when I die and when I'm gone, 
there'll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on. 

Give me my freedom for as long as I be.
All I ask of living is to have no chains on me. 
All I ask of living is to have no chains on me, 
and all I ask of dying is to go naturally, only want to go naturally.
Don't want to go by the devil, don't want to go by the demon, 
don't want to go by Satan, don't want to die uneasy,
just let me go naturally. 
And when I die and when I'm gone, 
there'll be one child born, there'll be one child born. 
When I die, there'll be one child born.
When I die, there'll be one child born.
When I die, there'll be one child born.

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

And I keep on trying in no uncertain terms
To let my light shine through

Only when the rain comes down
Only when the lightning strikes me
Will I find the answer for myself

[Chorus]

To always see the light of day and to know that I am living
All my life I won't take if I'm not giving

Only when the rain comes down
Only when the lightning strikes me
Will I find the answer for myself

[Chorus]",It's Got to Be Real
Lisa Stansfield,"Measure for measure
Your love's so much pleasure
Like a haunting melody
It came inside and captured me

And I'm so happy
You're the rhythm of my life
You and I together will stand the test of time

(You know how to love me)
Give me more love, give me more time
I can't understand it
Maybe you've found someone new
Tell me what did I do wrong
What did I do

Looking into your eyes now
I don't see the love we had
I don't see compassion
I don't see anything

[Chorus]
Give me just a little more love
Some more to tide me over
Give me just a little more passion
Give me just a little more love

And a little more time
I don't see the reason
Why you should be so unfair
But I have seen it coming
Seen it hanging in the air

Baby when you hold me
You don't touch me like you did
But still I want you by my side
Baby I'll do anything

[Chorus]

I can see you're slipping away from me
But I still feel the magic sometimes
When we touch
You and me, it has to be
'Cause baby without you I don't think that I can carry on

So feel it from the heart
And when you love me
Love me tenderly
Feel it from the heart
And when you love me

Deceived and spurned me
But maybe not this time
'cause that was in the past
How I've been scared
To put my trust in something good that may not last
But baby, not this time

Dreamed the warm skin of your body burning next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips, caressed your hips

Time to make you mine

The sweet anticipation of hands I know will touch me soon

It's the little things you do that make me love you,
The way you touch my hair,
The way you care,
And when night-time comes around,
I fall asleep with you,
So I can dream the day all over again.

With sweet sweet love runnin' through me,
I give you everything I have and everything I can be,
I can't stand the thought of ever losing you,
So baby stay with me.

I wake up,
You wake up my very soul,
Time just flies away the more you kiss me,
May we forever share this love affair.

They play the game, play hard to get
Then it all goes wrong and they end up being lonely
I'm one of those people

Got me missing you
You've got me missing you

At the time it seemed okay
Nothing too serious I said
Just two people having fun
Or so I thought

At the time I was playing it cool
I had it all under control
But then I broke the golden rule
I went and said, ""You'd never have me""
But baby

You've got me missing you
Every day, every night
You've got me missing you
Without you this ain't a life
Got me missing you
And baby try as I might
I just can't stop this pain inside

If I could do it all again
I'd say the things I truly meant
'Cause now you're gone, I've gone insane
Funny how I always said, ""You'd never have me""

You've got me missing you

I remember the nights I cried
Now I'm gonna forget you bab'
Push you right out of my mind
Ohh don't you know that

I decided to find some better weather
And chase that rain right out of my sky
I'm off through being sad and blue
Tell you why

(I cried my)
I cried my last tear, last night baby
And I'm not gonna cry
Never never gonna cry
I'm not gonna cry no more
(I cried my last tear)
Ohh I cried it last night baby
(Ooo)
And one thing it true won't be crying over you

If you think I'll be broken hearted
Think it's time that you think again
'cause this time I won't sit here waiting
Waiting here for the tears to end
Baby I refuse to be blue one more minute over you
Ooo ooh

(I cried my last tear baby)
Yes I did
(Won't be crying over you)
No never no never no more
(I cried my last tear baby)
One thing is true, won't be crying over you

(I cried my last tear last night baby)
Ooo ooh ooh
And I'm not gonna cry

Ohh no I am not gonna cry no more

One thing is true, won't be crying over you

Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care

We got ground to dig and worms to scratch

There ain't nobody here but us chickens, there ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself, stop that fuss, ain't nobody here but us

Someone's sneaking round the corner
I'll bet that someone, someone's Mack the knife

You said that you were moving on, come Saturday
That you'd be gone, I thought of life without you and I cried
So finally I know who I am gonna love for all my life
So say you'll be mine, please say I can change your mind

Don't leave, don't leave me now, I know I'll love you for forever
For all the stars above, don't leave now, I'm in love

I didn't have a clue that the girl was me
So listen to me now that things have changed, I love you

So suddenly my fate is sealed

My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To hell with those lords o'er the sea

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

I didn't know what I was doing half the time
I didn't know that my life would ever change
I didn't think that anybody felt the same way

I said I wanna try it all without regrets
I wanna meet the kind of folks I never met

We never thought there'd be another hand to hold
We didn't care--we never did what we were told
They couldn't break us--they could never turn us cold, no

The way it used to be

I tell you what is wrong
I went to the mountain
But the mountain top was gone

Remember those trees
Where as kids we dreamed
They tore em down years ago
And built a factory

And when that plant closed
The workers all left town
I read in the paper that
Some kids were killed
When it burnt down

Now I stare at that field
Like circle in the earth
And nothing’ll grow now
That’s not soil
It’s just dirt

And I cant stand it
What’s the use in making something new
If all that made us must be ruined

I cant demand it
I got nothing but

I see her look at me
I swear that it is mockingly

And you decide what I should like
But I don’t buy no hype
Like in the magazine
The one with the beauty queen on the front

I wanna run, run far away
I gotta get far away from you
I gotta keep my identity
And focus what I can do, oh!

I don’t want to be famous
If I got to be shameless
If you don’t know what my name is (name is)
So what? (so what?)
I don’t know what this game is
Cause I’m not even playing it
You don’t know what my name is (Name is)
So what? (so what?)

She’s just a chickadee
They chose her for celebrity
It’s all a stunt
Why does it get to me?
‘Til I react so angrily to the stuff?
And maybe I’m not worth your time
Not a stop upon your climb
It doesn’t bother me
It’s just my insecurities acting up

I wanna run, run far away
I gotta get far away from you
I gotta keep my identity
And focus what I can do, oh!

So take a shot for free
And photo-shop the bits of me that you don’t want
I’ll steal your magazine

With my blue jeans on and you stuck in my head
I take it all back, I don't mean what I said

Dead roses on the bedside table
And a movie on, I think it's Betty Grable
I've been here for days so what's a couple days more?

I've been sleepwalking
Dreams talking
Telling myself that soon I will be feeling alright
We've been cheap thrillin'
And free wheeling
Taking the worries and giving them up to the night

I replay all the scenes in my head
Till I get blue in the face while you're waking the dead
Is it just me or do you miss me?

I'm walking these city streets
Life is so incomplete
Everywhere I look

I'm walking these city streets
And every set of eyes I meet
Read me like a book

They can tell I've been sleepwalking

Telling myself that soon I will be feeling alright
Have you been cheap thrillin'
And free wheeling
Taking your worries and giving them up to the night?
