Doc Severinsen,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
Doc Severinsen,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Doc Severinsen,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight

Doc Severinsen,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow
Doc Severinsen,"L is for the way you look at me.
O is for the only one I see.
V is very, very extraordinary.
E is even more than anyone that you adore can.

Love is all that I can give to you,
Love is more than just a game for two.
Two in love can make it.
Take my heart and please don't break it,
Love was made for me and you.

For me and you.",Love
Doc Severinsen,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Doc Severinsen,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Doc Walker,"Comes a time when you're driftin'
Comes a time when you settle down
Comes a light feeling's liftin'
Lift that baby right up off the ground

Oh, this old world keeps spinning 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

You and I we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
That's how we kept what we gave away

Oh, this old world keeps spinning 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time
Comes a time, comes a time

Oh, this old world keeps spinning 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time
Comes a time, comes a time
Comes a time, comes a time

Doc Walker,"Driving through the long night
Trying to figure who's right and who's wrong
Now the kid is gone
I sit belted up tight
She pulls on a match light glowing bronze
Steering on

And I might be more of a man
If I stopped this in its tracks and say come on
Lets go home
But she's got the wheel
I've got nothing except what I have on

When you're driving with the brakes on
When you're swimming with your boots on
It's hard to say you love someone
And it's hard to say you don't

Trying to keep the mood right
Trying to steer the conversation from
The thing we've done
She shuts up the ashtray
And I say it's a long way back now huh
But she just yawns

And she's got the wheel
And I've got to deal from now on

When you're driving with the brakes on
When you're swimming with your boots on
It's hard to say you love someone
And it's hard to say you don't

Unless the moon falls tonight.
Unless continence collides

Nothings gonna make me
Break from her sight

'Cause when you're driving with the breaks on
When you're swimming with your boots on
It's hard to say you love someone
And it's hard to say you don't
When you're driving with the breaks on
When you're driving with the breaks on",Driving with the Brakes On
Doc Walker,"I want to know
If I walk down a certain road, it was my choice
And I want to know
If I had something to say, I raised my voice

I don't wanna wake up a little too late
And say I could've done this or I should've done that
When I close my eyes at night
I wanna know I'm doing the best I can

When I'm sittin' there
In my rocking chair, looking at my life
I hope to God I would've done
Something good with my life

At the end of the day, I can only pray
That I can look back and say
I lived my life, oh, I lived my life

Don't want to take my father's father's path
I gotta make my own
Don't want my epitaph to read
""Wish they could've known me""
I don't want that carved in stone

I want to leave this place
With a smile on my face
Knowing what's in my heart
Didn't just stay in my heart
And whatever heaven gave me
I want to know I gave it all back

When I'm sittin' there
In my rocking chair, looking at my life
I hope to God I would've done
Something good with my life

At the end of the day, I can only pray
That I can look back and say
I lived my life, oh, I lived my life

When I'm sittin' there
In my rocking chair, looking at my life
I hope to God I would've done
Something good with my life

At the end of the day, I can only pray
That I can look back and say
I lived my life, oh, I lived my life

Well, I want to be an open book
Say I gave more than I took
My life, I lived my life, I lived my life",My Life
Doc Walker,"There oughta be a faster way
To fill up a Malibu, I swear
Thank God today you can pay here at the pump
Oh, one little thing to make up time
To get me back out there
Headin down the road like a bullet from a gun

I bet she's in that flannel robe
Curled up by the file
Reading Bridget Jones for the fifteenth time
Every minute I'm not there
Is another I'll need forgiveness for
There's still 300 miles to care about

Everything is in slow motion
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back, trying to get back to you

I wonder how it'll go down
When I pull up in the drive
Will she throw her arms around me
Or throw me out?
I can beg and plead my case
And say I need her in my life
But I can't do a thing from where I am right now

Everything is in slow motion
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back, trying to get back to you

Mile after mile
Wheels turn so slow
Will I ever get back home

Everything is in slow motion
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back, trying to get back to you

Everything is in slow motion
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back, trying to get back to you

No matter what I do

Doc Walker,"Oh girl I don't know what to say
I feel you love me less each day
You seem so far away
And there's not a kiss that's strong enough
I could give to keep your love

To change your mind to stay
So you packed your bags
Said you need a break
And you left me here to wait

Said you might come back some day
So I'm holding on
In spite of what they say
They say ""man she's gone""

And only a fool would wait
And call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
I've nowhere else to be

And nothing left to do
Call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
And there's nowhere I'd rather be

Then waiting here for you
So call me a fool
Oh girl the time goes by so slow
Just staring at the door

Hoping you'll walk through
So if I hang on long enough
Would I be worth your love?
'Cause its something I could do

I'm just holding on
In spite of what they say
They say ""man she's gone""
And only a fool would wait

So call me a fool
Still holding on
In spite of what they say
They say ""man she's gone""

And only a fool would wait
Then call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
I've nowhere else to be

And nothing left to do
Call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
And there's nowhere I'd rather be

Doc Walker,"I met her a month ago, down at the boogie ranch
She came onto me in her red polyester pants
I've never had a woman so drop dead fine
It's hard to believe I ever made her mine

Well, she calls me baby 54 times a day
And all of my friends think that I've got it made
When other men stare, that's something she can't avoid
I'm so insecure, yeah, I'm so paranoid

[Chorus]
I'm just waiting, well, I'm just waiting
Well, I'm just waiting for her to break my heart

When we're alone together it's paradise
Victoria's Secret and cold champagne all nice
But for the second time this month it's happened again
She thanks me for roses that I didn't send

[Chorus]

The handwritings on the wall
Pretty soon the tears are gonna fall

Well, I'm just waiting, well, I'm just waiting
Well, I'm just waiting for her to break my heart

[Chorus]",I'm Just Waiting
Doc Walker,"She said ""I got this hat in California
From a man on the street, his name was Joe
Have you ever been to California?
Well, you really gotta go""

She said ""I knew a boy down in Miami
He was a welder, just like you
I love the ocean in Miami
I've never seen anything quite so blue""

[Chorus]
And I'd say
""Hey Where are we going today rocket girl
Tell me what life is like past that city limit sign
Dream your dreams in my ear
Baby just get me outta here
Fly me around this world 
Rocket girl""

She said ""have you ever been to Alberta?
Wheat fields as far as you could see
Have you ever seen the prairies?
Someday I'll take you there with me""

[Chorus]

I never tell her she's been busted
I know she's never been anywhere just like me
But it makes her feel like Cinderella
And I get to see the world for free (get to see the world for free)

I just say
""Hey Where are we going today rocket girl
Tell me what life is like past that city limit sign
Dream your dreams in my ear
Baby just get me outta here
Fly me around this world""",Rocket Girl
Doc Walker,"She is the prettiest girl I've ever seen
The walking definition of a beauty queen
And every man in town wants to take her away
But she hasn't always been this way

You should've seen that girl 10 years ago
With a cool-aid mustache and a freckled nose
Now she's breaking hearts and taking names
But she hasn't always been this way

She didn't mean anything to me
I brushed her off so easily
She hasn't always been this way
I really can't believe how much that girl has changed

She's outta my life
She's outta my reach
I'm outta her mind
She's outta my league

But she hasn't always been this way
Well her brother Bobby was my best friend
So she followed us around wherever we went
Now she won't give me the time of day

But she hasn't always been this way
When I was 16 she gave me a card
That said ""I love you with all my heart""
She hasn't always been this way
I really can't believe how much that girl has changed

She's outta my life
She's outta my reach
I'm outta her mind
She's outta my league

But she hasn't always been this way [Repeat: x 2]",She Hasn't Always Been This Way
Doc Walker,"Good things come to those who wait
And only fools rush in
I've let those words guide my fate
Time and time again
But nothing's etched in stone
And I guess I should have known
That whoever made those rules never looked into your eyes
On a moonlit night
Who would have thought that I could've found a love this strong
Can't be wrong
Less is more made sense before
But now I can't get enough
Baby you made a fool of whoever made those rules
Some say love will lose its shine
Once the new wears off
The heat of passion fades with time
But they couldn't be more wrong
I knew with just one look
That we would rewrite the book
'Cause whoever made those rules never looked into your eyes
On a moonlit night
Who would have thought that I could've found a love this strong
Can't be wrong
Less is more made sense before

Doc Walker,"I held onto the hurt
Wrestled to the ground
I fought it like heaven and hell
And I lost every round
There wasn't anybody I would trust
't was so long since I'd felt love
I'd forgotten what it was

Baby, 'til you 
Got ahold of my angry heart
I saw the truth
When you led my way out of the dark
I was draggin' around these chains
Like some ghost in the hall
Swearin' out the pain
And empty from it all
Until you got ahold of my angry heart

Living in the past
Locked up with my rage
Well I built that prison myself
And it's such a lonely cage
I started believing I would never heal
But your love changed my life when I thought my fate was sealed

Baby, 'til you 
Got ahold of my angry heart
I saw the truth
When you led my way out of the dark
I was draggin' around these chains
Like some ghost in the hall
Swearin' out the pain
And empty from it all
Until you got ahold of my angry heart

I thought I would disappear without a trace
Until your love washed each teardrop from my face

Baby, 'til you 
Got ahold of my angry heart
I saw the truth
When you led my way out of the dark
I was draggin' around these chains
Like some ghost in the hall

And empty from it all

Doc Walker,"I'm gonna take some time for livin'

I'm gonna send a prayer into the blue skies

Doc Walker,"I remember that first summer night
How good it felt, you lyin' in my arms
But the midway rides are almost still
The tilt-a-whirl and the ferris wheel are gone
As I run my fingers through your golden hair
The air's gettin' cold 
And leaves are fallin' everywhere

And we've got one last sundown
So won't you lay your head down
I don't wanna hear 'goodbye'
I just want you by my side
For just one last sundown

Every waking moment since we've met
We've never been more that a couple of steps apart
And tomorrow just won't be the same
Pack up all your summer things in the car

We never said it
But we knew it couldn't last
But we didn't know
That this night would come so fast

Now we've got one last sundown
So won't you lay your head down
I don't wanna hear 'goodbye'
I just want you by my side
For just one last sundown

Now we've got one last sundown
So won't you lay your head down

Doc Walker,"I was out with the guys last Saturday night
I lost track of time
I just about forgot to call and say I'd be late
You said just be safe
I won't worry
Are you having a good time
Don't hurry just let me know so
I won't lie awake
I might get carried away but don't think I don't care
Cause baby you're the only reason
That my life has any meaning
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno what I'd do without your love
When I think about you leaving
It's a hallow saken feeling
And I dunno, I dunno, I dunno what I'd do without your love
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno what I'd do without your love
Hurting you is never intended
Don't want to ever take you for granted but
Sometimes I'm just a thoughtless man
I might trip and stumble
Take it from me
I ain't perfect but I wish I could be
Everytime you smile and take my hand
Cause baby you're the only reason
That my life has any meaning
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno what I'd do without your love
When I think about you leaving
It's a hallow saken feeling
And I dunno, I dunno, I dunno what I'd do without your love
I dunno, I dunno what I'd do without your love
Oh without your love
Without your love
Cause baby you're the only reason
That my life has any meaning
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno what I'd do without your love
When I think about you leaving

Doc Walker,"I don't know how you paint my sky so blue
I'm walkin' around stone drunk on you said hello and I was gone
Stuck in my head like a pretty song

Was it Summer in and an easy Fall
And it was love and that was all
Those lucky stars won't leave me alone
I'm the one that gets to take you home

You're mine, you're mine
And that's how I like it
I'm yours, I'm yours
And nobody else's
You're mine, you're mine
You hit me, I felt it
I'm yours, I'm yours
And that's how I like it

That's how I like it

The way you twist your hair when you watch TV
And fall asleep while your leaning on me
And a million other things that I wouldn't change
It sounds like your singing when you say my name
Your always late but the world stands still
I don't understand and I never will
These lucky stars can't leave me alone
Yeah I'm the one that gets to take you home.

You're mine, you're mine
And that's how I like it
I'm yours, I'm yours
And nobody else's
You're mine, you're mine
You hit me, I felt it
I'm yours, I'm yours
And that's how I like it

That's how I like

The moment in your eyes and there it is
My stories told
The only thing I really know is all I need to know

Baby you're mine, you're mine
And that's how I like it
I'm yours, I'm yours
And nobody else's
You're mine, you're mine
You hit me, I felt it
I'm yours, I'm yours

I hooked my toe in the old doormat and fell as flat as I could be

I had me a little old bottle o' booze (and I didn't have no more)

There's a little old rat in his hidin' place, he got that whiskey scent
He slipped right up 'n he got him a sssshrlp, 'n back to his hole he went

He slipped right up 'n he got him a sssshrlp (he's drinkin' it all) 'n back to his hole he went

He slipped right up to my puddle o' gin and he lapped up more and more
He says ""Doggone, my red-eyed soul, I'm a-gonna get drunk once more""

""I gonna get drunk once more, I'm a-gonna get drunk once more
He says ""Doggone, my red-eyed soul, I'm a-gonna get drunk once more""

He washed his face with his front paws and on his hind leg he sat
And he's a-gettin' pretty high when he winked one eye and he says ;(hic) 
Hey, where's that old tom-cat?

""Now where's that old tom-cat? I said where's that old tom-cat?

I saw her first on an April morn'
As she walked through the mist in a field of hay
Her hair lit the world with its golden glow
And the smile on her face burned my heart away

I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low

But the field of hay was soon cut down
In a short few weeks it all was past
And my golden girl just a painful song

May act tough but it's just my style
'Cause I can't forget my good old rough and rowdy ways

Who knew me when I was a rounder
He grabs my hand and he'll say, ""Boy, have a drink""

Not a star was in sight
An' the north wind came
Howlin' down the line
With his sweetheart, so dear
Stood a brave engineer
With his orders to pull ole number nine
She kissed him goodbye
With tears in his eyes
An' a joy in her heart
She couldn't hide
For the whole world was bright
When she told him that night
Tomorrow she'd be his blushin' bride 

As the wheels hummed the song
As the train rolled along
An' the black smoke come pourin' from the stack
As the headlight a gleam
Seemed to brighten' his dream
For tomorrow he'd be comin' back
He speed up the hill
But his brave head was still
For the headlight was shining in his face
He whispered a prayer
As he threw on the air
For he knew it would be his final race 

In the wreck he was found
Lying there on the ground
An' he ask them to raise his weary head
As his breath slowla went
This message he sent

Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball

From New York to St. Louis and old Chicago by the way
To the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall

I'd be in Tennessee.

You can take down my old violin
And play it all you please.

It'll be of no use to me.""

Doc Watson,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would

If I knowed her number, Lord, I'd flag her down

Where was you when the train left town?

If I had my gun I'd let the hammer down

There's a bright and a sunny side too

It will brighten all our way

Though the storm and its fury breaks today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
The clouds and storm will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear

Let us treat with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or clear
Let us trust in our Savior old ways
He will keep us everyone in His care

Doc Watson,"Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

Last Saturday evening
Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me

On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read ""Dear Love, I've done you wrong,
Now I must set you free""

No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend

Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

I looked into the muddy waters
And what did I see
I saw a lonely, lonely face
Just looking back at me

Tears in his eyes
Ang a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips

Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

wake up wake up little maggie

why do you sleep so sound

them highway robbers are a coming

gone a tear your play house down



oh where is my little darling

the girl I love so dear

she's gone away and left me

andis a courtin some other one


I got drunk in the city

then I stumbled and fell at her door

she throwed her little arms around me

but she bid me come back no more


Oh my head bows down like the willow

and I'm lonesome like a dove

sometimes there's tears on my pillow

when I think about my love


Oh where is my little darling

she's gone away and left me

and is a courting another man

Doc Watson,"Oh, listen to my story, I'll tell you no lies,
How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise.
He told her to meet him at Adams's Springs.
He promised her money and other fine things.

So, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.
No money he brought her nor other fine things.

""Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.
We'll go and get married and no one will know.""

She climbed up behind him and away they did go,
But off to the river where deep waters flow.

""John Lewis, John Lewis, will you tell me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?""

""Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell you my mind.
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind.""

""Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife.""

He kissed her and hugged her and turned her around,
Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown.

He got on his pony and away he did ride,
As the screams of little Omie went down by his side.

T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found.

Two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,
And saw little Omie's body go floating away.

They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank.

Then sent for John Lewis to come to that place --
And brought her out before him so that he might see her face.

He made no confession but they carried him to jail,
No friends or relations would go on his bail.

On a cold November day
In a cold and lonesome box car

His pal sat there before him

His dying buddy said

& I know shes getting nigh

We rambled all around
In every kind of weather
We slept out on the ground

That always makes a stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock

That she need not worry a tall

Where I won't have to work at all

No I wll not have to work there

Said son if you don't quit your rowdy ways
You'll have trouble at your door
If it wasn't for heartaches and trouble good people
Lord I would not be here today
I will ramble this whole world over
At home I cannot stay
Give me corn bread
On the table when I'm hungry
Something tall and cool when I'm dry
And a true loving woman to stand by me
Sweet heaven when I die
Go dig a hole in the meadow good people
Make it deep in that cold cold ground
Then gather around all you kind friends 
And see this poor rounder go down
And when I'm dead and they buried me
With my pale face turned to the sun
Will you stand around and moan little woman
And think of the way you have done

Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Now boys, don't believe what a girl tells you
Though her eyes be blue or brown
Unless she's on some scaffold high
Saying, ""Boys, I can't come down""

Go tell my youngest brother
Not to do the things I've done
But to shun that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

I'm going back, back to New Orleans
For my race is nearly run
Gonna spend the rest of my wicked life
Beneath that Rising Sun

Doc Watson,"Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long;
While there are others living about us,
Never molested, though in the wrong.

When death has come and taken our loved ones,
Leaving our home so lone and so drear,
Then do we wonder why others prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

Farther along we'll know all about it,
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.

Sometimes I wonder why I must suffer,
Go in the rain, the cold, and the snow,
When there are many living in comfort,
Giving no heed to all I can do.


""Faithful till death"" saith our loving Master;
A few more days to labor and wait;
Then will our toiling seem to be nothing,
When we shall pass the heavenly gate.

Farther along we'll know all about it,
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.

When we see Jesus coming in glory,
When He comes from His home in the sky
then we'll go with Him to heaven's bright city
We'll understand it all by and by.

Farther along we'll know all about it,
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.",Farther Along
Doc Watson,"Precious Lord Take My hand lead me on let me stand
Lord I'm tired weak and I'm worn
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on to the light
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me on

When my friends don't understand
And they fail to lend a hand
When my load gets to heavy to bear
As I go along life's way
I just slip away and pray
And dear Lord I can always find you there.

When my way groweth drear
And the night's drawin' near
When my life is almost gone
At that river I stand
Guide my feet Lord, won't you take my hand
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me on.

Precious Lord Take My hand lead me on let me stand
Lord I'm tired getting weak and so worn
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on Lord to that blessed light

Doc Watson,"A miner was leaving his home for his work
When he heard his little child scream.
He went to the side of the little girl's bed;
She said, ""Daddy, I've had such a dream!""
""Please, daddy, don't go to the mines today,
For dreams have so often come true.
My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,
For I never could live without you.""

Then smiling and stroking the little girl's face,
He was turning away from her side.
But she threw her small arms around daddy's neck;
She gave him a kiss and then cried:

""Oh, I dreamed that the mines were all flaming with fire,
And the men all fought for their lives.
Just then the scene changed, and the mouth of the mines
Was covered with sweethearts and wives.""

""Oh, daddy, don't go to the mines today,
For dreams have so often come true.
My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,
For I never could live without you.""

""Go down to the village and tell your dear friends
That as sure as the bright stars do shine,
There is something that's going to happen today;
Please, daddy, don't go to the mines.""

For dreams have so often come true.

Now we must part
And as the angels come and call for you
The pangs of grief tug at my heart

   Oh my darling my darling

   Your lone journey

Oh the days will be empty the nights so long
Without you my love
And as God calls for you I'm left alone

And when I come we will walk hand in hand

Lordy how they did love 
They swore to be true to each other 
As true as the stars above 
He was her man 
He wouldn't do her wrong 

Frankie went down to the corner
Just to get a bucket of beer
She said Mr. bartender
Has my lovin' Johnny been here?
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong

I ain't gonna tell you no story 
I ain't gonna tell you no lie

And much to her surprise
There on a cot sat Johnny
Making love to Nellie Bly
She said, ""He's my man
But he's doin' me wrong""

Pulled out her old .44

Right through that hardwood door

Because he was doin' her wrong

Roll out your rubber tired buggy
Roll out your rubber tired hack
She's taking her man to the graveyard
But she ain't gonna' bring him back

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

And Antichrist appear;
My silent dust beneath the ground;
There's no disturbance there.

To call poor sinners to repent
And seek their Savior dear.

And stand on Zion's wall.
Confirm the drunk, confirm the weak
And after sinners call.

The object of my love,
The time's been sweet l've spent with you,
My sweet and harmless dove,
My little children near my heart
My warm affections know.
From each the path will I attend.
O from them can I go?!

O God, a father to them be
And keep them from all harm,
That they may love and worship Thee
And dwell upon Thy charm.
How often you have looked fer me
And often seen me come.
But now I must depart from thee
And nevermore return.

Neither lament nor mourn;
Fer I will with my Jesus be
And dwell upon his charm.

And there forgotten lie.
Let persecutions rage around,
Let Antichrist appear;
Beneath the cold and silent ground
There's no disturbance there.

Through heats and cold I've toiled and went
And wandered in despair;

And seek the Savior dear.

And stand on Zion's wall.
Confirm the strong, revive the weak,
And after sinners call.

My little children, near my heart,
And nature seems to bind,
It grieves me sorely to depart
And leave you here behind.

Let this not grieve your heart,
For you will shortly come to me
Where we shall never part.



",Hicks' Farewell
Doc Watson,"Went out one night for to make a little round
I met little Sadie and I shot her down
Went back home and I got in my bed
Forty four pistol under my head

Wake up next morning 'bout a half past nine
The hacks and the buggies all standing in line
Gents and the gamblers standing all round
Taking little Sadie to her burying ground

Then I begin to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and away I run
Made a good run but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho

I was standing on the corner, reading the bill
When up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
He said, young man, ain't your name Brown?
Remember the night you shot Sadie down?

I said, yes, sir, my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
And first degree and the second degree
If you got any papers, won't you read 'em to me?

They took me downtown and dressed me in black
Put me on the train and started me back
They crammed me back in that Thomasville jail
And I had no money for to go my bail

That judge and the jury, they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty one days and forty one nights
Forty one years to wear the ball and the stripes

Doc Watson,"Step up, buddies, and listen to my song
I'll sing it to you right, but you may sing it wrong,
All about a man named Otto Wood,
I can't tell you all, but I wish I could.

He walked in a pawn shop a rainy day,
And with the clerk he had a quarrel, they say.
Pulled out his pistol and he struck him a blow,
And this is the way the story goes.

They spread the news as fast as they could,
The sheriff served a warrant on Otto Wood.
The jury said murder in the second degree,
And the judge passed the sentence to the penitentiary.

[Chorus]
Otto, why didn't you run?
Otto's done dead and gone.
Otto Wood, why didn't you run
When the sheriff pulled out his 44 gun?

They put him in the pen, but it done no good,
It wouldn't hold the man they call Otto Wood.
It wasn't very long till he slipped outside,
Drawed a gun on the guard, said, ""Take me for a ride.""

Second time they caught him was away out west,
In the holdup game, he got shot through the breast.
They brought him back and when he got well,
They locked him down in a dungeon cell.

He was a man they could not run,
He always carried a 44 gun.
He loved the women and he hated the law,
And he just wouldn't take nobody's jaw.

He rambled out west and he rambled all around,
He met the sheriff in a southern town.
And the sheriff says, ""Otto, step this way,
'Cause I've been expecting you every day.""

He pulled out his gun and then he said,
""If you make a crooked move, you both fall dead.
Crank up your car and take me out of town,""
And a few minutes later, he was graveyard bound.",Otto Wood the Bandit

I Wonder Where You Are Tonight

 
  
Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary
Wondering if I'm wrong or right
To think about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight

   The rain is cold and slowly falling
   Upon my window pane tonight
   And though your love seems even colder
   I wonder where you are tonight

Your heart was cold you never loved me
Though you often said you cared
And now you've gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared

Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight

Doc Watson,"My name is Juanano de Castro
My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To hell with those lords o'er the sea

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

You know wolves gonna be so tamed

'Cause I got them deep river blues
Let that old river rise and fall and let the big waves make a wall
'Cause I got them deep river blues, alright son

My old gal's a good little pal, she walks just like a waterfall
When I get them deep river blues
Ain't no one to cry for me, the fish all go out on a spree
When I get them deep river blues

Give me back my old boat, I'm gonna sail if she'll float
Yes, I got them deep river blues
I'm goin' back to muscle shoals, time's getting better there I'm told
'Cause I got them deep river blues

Well, if my boat sinks with me, I'm gonna go down, don't you see
Yes, I got them deep river blues
And now I'm gonna say goodbye, if I sink then just let me die
'Cause I got them deep river blues, get them all

Doctor Billy Dodd,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Trapped in your cell, but it's really a living hell
Final hour it begins, soul crawling under your skin
There's a priest at the door, who could ask for any more
Speaks your last - Last rights, now you're gone just like the light

There's nowhere for you to run
Living under the gun, praying to god

Start your walk to the chair, hell awaits - You soon be there
Never mind what you see, it's just an offering to thee
Tape your eyes - No sight, now your gone just like the light

There's nowhere for you to run
Living under the gun

I reflect on the chairs of my past
How this one it will be the last
Father, son, holy ghost
Condemn me to hell, where I will roast

So I start a killing spree that led me to this destiny

Fool me again baby

When this is done
Will your run
Will you stay
Met me at the easy way

When you won't be mine

Time, time, time!

Is enough to stay
It's so hard to live

Meet me in your car
Meet me on the moon

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Dog Eat Dog,"Yeah it's a big world out there
And most of it is water.
So you better learn how to swim real good
Or you should know how to fly this is motion
Taking too long, like a bad song, fly to Hong Kong,
High as the sky without the bong.
Never the less the level of stress was endless,
I felt pressed in the cabin cass business.
I remember what it took to get us here,
The mad years we performed just for the beer.
Now we hover undercover in the atmosphere.
Intergalactic players, true pioneers. 
Big wheel, spinnin' around, 
Breaking through cities and rippin' through town.
Get down time to flip that frown,
Keep your body moving from your feet to the crown. 
This is the J to the O H to the N see and then I'm on.
I spy like James Bond. N to the OR. I'll put you in the ER,
Fuming like a cigar, screaming like a marshall.
Electric guitar strap me in there, a true circle, the perfect square.
Hot like flares, danger, beware you must prepare.
Only strategic affairs turn boys to millionaires.
We got to keep moving/forever staying in motion.
Papa never gave me tools to the trade, yo, I'm tryin' to make the grade.
Suckas think I got it made. I won't trade or give aid.

You nothing, but the truth. You must pursue in the endeavor.

What do you need?
I need a chance to go for it all cause I got plans.
What do you got?
I got nothing but fire burning inside for all I desire.
What do you see?
All I see is walls obstacles in my way they're gonna fall.
How do you feel?
It's all wrong but if it's not kill me I'm getting strong.
Where do you go?
On that I must decide exhibiting a sense of self.

It's always there in the back of your mind
Read it in the paper, see it on TV

Accidents occur, we don't know why

One crashed and the whole world cried
No time to say goodbye
You won't see your future in a crystal ball
Psychic friends can't help you at all
Can't buy time at a shopping mall

Struck by lightning, fall in a well
It sounds far fetched, but you never can tell
When you swim with sharks that you can't repel
No one can hear your yell

When you least expect it, expect the unexpected
Won't ever know why it all comes down

Planes go up and crash back down
You never thought when you left the ground
That you would not be found
Took a chance when you made that bet
Laid it on the line, now you're starting to sweat
This is one day you'll never forget
Cash in your pocket, no regrets
Fly in the sky or sail in a boat
It don't matter which way you go
Titanic, don't panic
There's other ways to cross the Atlantic
Don‘ t be suprised by what you hear
Things aren't always as they appear
The unexpected is nothing to fear
The truth is always clear

Murders at will...

With your hair in your face,
My head in my hands
Hoping to find something
That we've never known.
Looking like two little kids with our wide eyes,
Slow tenderness,
Asking,
Saying things that we always do.

When we're feeling we've been cheated out of
Something we deserve,
Then these small wonders
Keep us awake at night,
These small wonders
Hold us down the ground,
And show us who we are.

Walking side by side
With our fear,
Our hope,
Our love,
And our pride,
Two steps forward, no looking back.
Every chance to fall through
Then its one look and the world becomes you
Untouched,
We know we're on our way.

When we're feeling we've been wasted
By too much time inside,
Then these small wonders,
They keep us awake at night,
These small wonders,
Hold us down to the ground,
And show us who we are.

Just when we know we've heard it all before,
The world comes screaming through our door

Do we want to let go 
Of this magic, 
And let it turn to truth
From mystery, 
Let all this hope be history

And it's as fast as fear, 
As it cuts away the sound
And slaps you when you're smiling
Just how easily you lose 
Everything you've found
At the speed of silence

When you told me you loved me, 
And I didn't say a word
I said I was sorry

Can well up,
But neither of us ever drown

It won't fall down 
And there it goes
And leaves us staring 
At our toes

Because the ground was killing me
But the deep blue sea 
Just got me down.

I will surely run away.

The trouble with love 
Is that it gets to know you
The trouble with love 
Is that it lifts you up and knocks you down

Is that when you know you don't need it, 
It's gone, and then it's all you want
That's the trouble with love

Well, he should've let the doubt pass 
By his mouth before he said
""Goodbye, this is the end"",

Is that it gets to know you

Is that it lifts you up and knocks you down

Is that just when you know where you are
You're looking for a getaway car
That's the trouble with love

Love is blind, deaf, dumb and stupid
If I ever find that little turd, 
I'm going to kill cupid
Once and for all, once and for all

The trouble with love 
Is that it cuts right through you
The trouble with love 
Is that it lifts you up and knocks you out
The trouble with love 
Is that just when you're sure 
You've got it all figured out, 
Then you know you don't know 
Anything about love

Ma con gli affari era il più bravo

Nel substrato anche suo padre ha sempre sudato
E ora che è sciupato non si regge sulle sue gambe
Fra cosa ti ha lasciato? una tv più grande
Potrei fare come Pietro andarmene lontano
Dove il mondo è più indietro e un po' meno bastardo
Ed abbandonare la gara ed abbondare le canne
Lasciare che sia lo spirito ad appagarmi

There's something waiting in the dark
Alone with the thought of a childhood lost
Now I'm hounded by the feeling
That for me all hope is gone

Thrown away, the innocence
No lenience for me
So I guess I'll take my dreams
And set them free

I could've been better
I should've been good
So many tears and years misunderstood
Wish that I could change
These things that I recall
I wish that I could rearrange it all

Now I'm looking to the heavens
Do You really care for me?

Thrown away, the records kept
They're swept from memory
When I gave my only Son
To set you free

Set you free

I get that feeling running through my veins

I'll drive this road into the sun

I don't need to go to school
I'll put the hammer down and I'll leave this town

The freeway just seems to unwind in front of me
And there's no return

My wheels of love
Fit me like a racing glove

Don't cross the line
Don't make mistakes

On a midnight run

Pass her by
Faster than the speed of light

Look out now

Help me now
I can't stay
Much more before I fade away

A short conversation was just a few words
A lie and a whisper, a knife in my back

If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say

Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Just don't lie to me

Burns me like fire, these things that I hear

Even though they'd done the same

Keeping me from the other side
Satisfy what my soul believes
If it could only see

On a red sky
In a green sea
On a black night

Save it for the innocent
Save it for the cruel
And leave it in the shadows of life
On a ship full of hopes and dreams
Took a trip down to misery
Realized that I'd been before
I found it hard to believe

On a red sky
In a green sea
On a black night

And leave it in the shadows of life

Save it for the cruel

The pain of knowing the hurt it had brought to so many

Give my life and more
But would it keep you satisfied
Baby I'm not sure
I change myself most everyday
But you don't reply
How can we survive
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't change the world
This timei can't change the world
From soft lips you speak to me
How's it gonna be
Everyday's a different story
Changing all the time
You come to me with promises
I listen as you speak
But the promise that you want the most
Is not for me to keep
You leave me on this withered vine / now
Stripped away and torn
Left with only fantasy
Dreams of nevermore
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
This timei can't change the world
Never said that I held the answers
I can't change the world
I'd give my spirit if you tried
A fortune lost a heart denied
I come to you in your sleep
My heart is yours for only you to keep
And when the days they pass me you will see
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't change the world
This time
I can't change the world
I never said I held the answers
I can't change the world
This time
I can't change the world

Out of ammunition to regain my mental state

Still - I can't escape your trance

Prayed for forgiveness for the things that I said
And now I wake up and see I was wrong
All those years wasted / now come and gone
How many years have I been this way
The lines grow deeper / time fades away
Now etched in stone don't have the strength anymore
To break down these walls again
I lit a candle in your honor today
Everything will come around again
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around again
Now I see you on the other side
Sunshine raining down upon your face
You look so beautiful that place where you live
You walk among your dreams we talked about
So I stand here and I stare
In my garden of neglect
Never noticed it before
That it's winter all the time
Was too busy staring at
Your garden that you grew in time
I can see it took a lot of years
Your colors fill my mind
I lit a candle in your honor today
Everything will come around again
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around again
Even though the years keep passing / I reflect
About the one I truly loved and pushed away
Suddenly I stop and feel
That winter rain I know so well
And close my eyes
Wish you all the best
And you never know
I lit a candle in your honor today
Everything will come around
And you never know that maybe someday

When the sky is dark I feel like it's light

Dokken,"D. Dokken/K. Keeling

It was late like the storm
Finding it hard tried to carry on
Without fear or the shame
We could walk in park without being afraid

Was a time I believed
As the story unfolded so free
Now the passion is gone
All wrong
Down to the lake moonlit dawn

There was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need
They say that it's starting to show
Should have seen it long ago
There was a time I believed
You were everything I need

As a child
We believed
We could wake from the night and the dawn it seemed
Was so warm
So warm
Into His arms like a child I was born

Was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need

Interlude

You took me like the sage
Searching for some absolution
Hard to know the reason nobody cared
Once upon a time

Take me right away
Let me know there's still a season
Let me know there's still a reason to live
I'm running out of time

There was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need
They say that it's starting to show
Should have seen it long ago
There was a time I believed
You were everything I need

So now I'm taking a chase of Cavasier
With all of those words that we shouldn't have said
Walking the beach for the last time again
Missing you more than I should

But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you

Alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you

I tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you

Alone again without you
Alone again, alone again

Dokken,"I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one

I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside but we can't be heard

But I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you but more afraid to loose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh, you gave me light

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Dokken,"But can I find my way to you?
We've got this everywhere
It's hard to see it through
Time wither like my fingers
I've given everything and more

I can't go on with it in mind
But now we're wrong and out of time
Into your mind
Yes, you'll find
That we were better off before

The sands of time have closed the door
We were better off before
No chance to find a way down
Yes, we were better off before

Time crushing all my soul
A faded picture left of me
Upon the wall
Pain now my only friend
When shadows fall I will remember

The sands of time have closed the door
And left us broken evermore
No chance to find a way down
Yes, we were better off before

I can't go on with it in mind
But now we're wrong and out of time
Into your mind

That we were better off before

Dokken,"It's not hard to believe
That the world isn't real
When the sun doesn't shine in your eyes
All the time

It's not hard to concede
As we cry and we bleed everyday
We just won't leave
Feel your heart stop

Still alive but you're not
So you scream that you've had enough
Done enough, said enough

See the reflections of lives that you've changed
As you look in the mirror and try to believe
It's been hard that I know
But I could have told you so you reap what you sow

Can you see in my face
All these tears I saved for you
Can you see it's not right
That our love was never real

Is it right to hold on to the words that we spoke
Even though now that feeling is gone in your eyes
It's been hard to let you go
Even though you found someone new

Everyday
It's been hard to find
With no peace of mind

Can you see in my face
All these tears I saved for you
Can you see it's not right
That our love was never real
",Can You See
Dokken,"I played the fool, it seems a thousand times before
When I got older, thought I've learned my lesson well
Then you came into my life and brought me down
Another lesson towards my fate

I feel like I've been standin' on the sun
Your fire burned my soul like no one's ever done

You can say what you want but don't bring me down
If you want me to play in your garden
Then don't bring me down, baby, if you want my love
Then don't bring me down

Your hyperstatic conversation till the dawn
It makes me tired but I see it turns you on
A tense relationship was all you've ever known
I tried to play but now it cuts me to the bone

I look into your eyes a thousand years away
For my compassion all I got was tears
I feel like I've been standing on the sun
Your fire burned my soul like no one's ever done
",Don't Bring Me Down
Dokken,"Turn the lights down low there's nobody home
I've been watchin' for hours the clock on the wall
Seems the hands are frozen they don't move at all
Then the silence breaks as you walk through the door

On an on an on somewhere I don't belong
I'm all out of reasons to stay so I won't
On an on an on it won't leave me alone
Wish that I could remember the time when I said

I can't wait any longer to love you
Turns my reflection away from the day
I can't stand when you're so indecisive
Make up your mind so I can escape

When I hold you close there's nobody home
I can hear every heartbeat whisper and woe
Turn me on with your eyes as I smile right on cue
You rehearse everything that you say an you do

On an on an on you and I don't belong
There's no reason to stay anymore so I won't
On an on an on some thing's terribly wrong
Wish that I could remember the time that we said

I can't wait any longer to love you
Turns my reflection away from the day
I can't stand when you're so indecisive
Make up your mind so I can escape

I waited so long, I'm heading for the other side
I'm losing my mind over you, over you

Dokken,"Said you were Sophia
Should have known you by another name
I tried to be a believer babe
But I sank down in your shame

Livin' on the east side I was in the west
I tried to bring my love to you
But you trashed me like the rest

I've been haunted by your love
You gave me heartbreak

Tried to be your lover, tried to be your friend
Tried to take your pain away
Would have loved you to the end
But their ain't no use in cryin'

I will get along
Hope you find your happiness
In your misery and woe

And I hope you're cryin' all alone
You left me haunted by your love
Haunted

And when you wake you find you're still alone
Drownin' in your tears
Will you see what you have done
When the love I had for you is gone

Dokken,"Leave me here alone
Lying in the burning sun
This world has bleached my bones
I should have taken your advice

Lying all alone
Lost to all my memories
Feeling like a stone
As the sky above me starts to weep

The desert falls
In my mind an endless sea
I will never know
What was and that will never be

Deep within this hole
Flowers lying on my bed
Softly as you speak
Telling me that you've been sad

Leave me here alone
'Cause I won't be coming back again
The moments that we own
Lie scattered in the sand

I surrender, surrender
All my love for you
Please remember, remember babe
I'll be there for you

Leave me here alone
'Cause I won't be coming back again
The moments that we own
Lie broken in the hands of time

Deciding the fate of us all
Testing my fate in religion
Tryin to make sense of it all
All hope was lost, I found reason
To look in your eyes and find something

The promise you gave was that you'd remain,
Not leave me here and go missin
I've been the one in the shadows
Watching your life through a window
When you open your eyes and feel me inside you
Why would you leave me for others

Wait for me, I'll come for you
Wait for me, can't you see I'm still sad
I'm still I'm sad

To look in your eyes and find something

Strait to the heart of the matter
If it's all been in vain why do I remain
Watchin you leave me for others

I need to get off

I need to feel it once again
This fire is dyin' 
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin' 
I can't feel the passion that we had before, anymore

contradiction, trepidation, different points of view
Sitting in a place I said I'd never go with you 
Given half a chance I guess I'd throw it all away

I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore

Live my dreams the way I like
Give no reasons for what I am

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me

Dolapdere Big Gang,"We all came out to montreux
On the lake geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank zappa and the mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place

But swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the grand hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know well never forget

Effimero il destino

Avide proteste per il rispetto

Tu che parli di diritti e doveri
Ed emetti giudizi severi
Che distruggono l'amore

Di primavera
Provare l'illusione di sentirsi speciali
E credere di cambiare il mondo

Staring at some old tattoos and crying
Can you walk that walk? Can you talk that deal?
Maybe I can make you feel like dying

When you put your money on the sheet
And you fall in love and life is sweet as it can be
No, I don't believe in anyone so I make believe
That everyone is trés Jolie, trés Jolie

Everywhere in the universe
Worlds collide and come to an end
I don't want to be beautiful
I don't want to wake up again
I want to touch the moon

You got two left feet and a musical ear
And a bodyguard standing over there whose flying
And she's all dressed up in a leotard
Is she old enough? Are you getting hard? I'm dying

It's a lot of work for a little crime
Just being born means doing time and doing me
No, I don't believe in anything so I make believe
That everything is trés joke, trés Jolie

Everywhere in the universe
Worlds collide and come to an end
I don't want to be beautiful
I don't want to wake up again

I don't want to be beautiful
I don't want to wake up again

His heart had been run over by a reckless lover 
She ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue

He was the victim of a love and run 
And I could plainly see that she had almost killed him 
Left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done

I'll take his heart and mend it if I can

Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play 
They say there home town girl made good and she'd go a long long way 
Mom wonders why I don't drive back in that big fine car I own 
The truth is I don't have a car and I'm ashamed to go back home 
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick 
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit 
These are all my possessions all I have to my name 
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame 

I'm so glad that dad can't see me now, his favorite little girl 
Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world 
And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name 
For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame 

A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick 
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit

Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
But they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see

And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend

I can catch it in the corner of my memory
I can make it breathe a breath of life into an old love that has died
And I can stand and reminisce a while
In my mind I can be anything I want to be
In my mind I can do anything I want to do
Except make my mind forget you
I can take a journey to the end of the rainbow
I can go there and back and never leave my room
I can change a heartache into a tiny snowflake
And I can take December and turn it into June
In my mind I can be anything I want to be...",I Can

And sometimes I believe you love me

There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you

There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again

Plays in the street as the cold wind blows 
In the ghetto 

And his hunger burns 
So he starts to roam the streets at night 
And he learns how to steal 
And he learns how to fight 
In the ghetto 

Then one night in desperation 
A young man breaks away 
He buys a gun, steals a car 
Tries to run, but he don't get far 
And his mama cries 

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man 
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand 
In the ghetto 

As her young man dies 
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' 
Another little baby child is born 
In the ghetto",In the Ghetto

A flower grows 
And I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows 
I believe for everyone who goes astray 
Someone will come to show the way 
Yes I believe
Oh I believe

I believe above the storm
The smallest prayer will still be heard 
I believe that someone
In the great somewhere hears every word 
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry 
Or touch a leaf or see the sky 
Then I know why I believe

The body grows weak 
The spirit grows numb 
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us

On the wings of a snow-white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above 
On the wings of a dove

Well, he was baptized in the usual way 
And when it was done 
God blessed His son

Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh, what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining, her little face pale
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out Never looked either way
A big object hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
The postman was passing 
And picked up the note
Addressed to the master
And these words he spoke
Strait up into heave this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",Letter to Heaven

Daddy I feel that I must talk to you 
Are you sure this is what you want to do? 
Now it's not for us kids that I beg you to stay 
Please don't just walk out on Mama this way 
She's mothered your children, she's spent her whole life 
Trying to be a good mother and wife 
And she stood by you when the rest let you down 
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now? 

I'm your oldest daughter, my age twenty-three 
Your new love is even younger than me 
She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew 
While Mama's are withered from working for you 

Mom's not young any more like your new love 
But your new love won't love you like my mama does 
You've taken her best years, so don't leave her now 
Please, Daddy say that you won't let her down

She went about her work singin' some old favorite song of hers 
And often singin' favorite songs for us 
And she was satisfied just bein' Mama to us children 
And the only woman Daddy ever loved 

Take me back to Mama's bosom 
Back to Daddy's lovin' arms 
Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone 

I can still remember us a runnin' to meet Daddy 
In the evening when his working day was done 
When Daddy saw us comin' he would bend his tired old back 
Holdin' out his arms, and into them we'd run 

And he'd hold us for a minute, we'd all walk home together 
While Mama waited for him at the door 
And he was satisfied just bein' Daddy to us children 
And the man my Mama lived her whole life for

I used to stand on a corner when I was a child 
And I'd play my guitar and sing as the people went by 
The sidewalks were crowded but I'd just sing louder cause I didn't mind 
Just spending my time, spinning my rhymes and singing for nickels and dimes 
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes 
I'd brighten their day as they go on their way and they'd brighten mine 
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind 
I knew that someday in my own special I'd repay all their nickels and dimes 

I recall the sidewalk each night as I stand on the stage 
As I play my guitar and sing for the people who paid 
Cause I finally made it to what they all call the big time 
But I still remember I still owe some nickels and dimes 

Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes 
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind 
So if you remember a child on the corner of time 
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes

Now I knew I'd won the race when I'd see my mama's face
And the way she looked at me and said
Big wind's a comin'

Oh but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow
The wind was blowin' trees were fallin'
And outside I heard him cryin' and as he lay there dyin'
It seemed I could still hear him sayin'
Big wind's a comin'
Big wind big wind's comin'",Big Wind
Dolly Parton,"(Merle Travis)
Come and listen you fellows 
So young and do fine 
And seek not your fortune 
In the dark, dreary mines 

It will form as a habit 
Seep in your soul 
'Til the blood in your veins 
Runs as black as the coal 

There's many a man 
That I've known in my day 
Who lived just to labor 
His whole life away 

Like a fiend with his dope 
And a drunkard his wine 
A man will have lust for 
The lure of the mine 

It's dark as a dungeon 
Damp as the dew 
The danger is double 
And the pleasures are few 

Where the rain never falls 
Where the sun never shines 
It's dark as a dungeon 
Way down in the mine 

I hope when I'm gone 
And the ages shall roll 
My body will blacken 
And turn into coal 

Then I'll look out the door 
Of my heavenly home 
And I'll pity the miners 
A-diggin' my bones 

It's dark as a dungeon 
Damp as the dew 
The danger is double 
And the pleasures are few 

Where the rain never falls 
Where the sun never shines 
It's dark as a dungeon 
Way down in the mine 

Where the rain never falls 
Where the sun never shines 
It's dark as a dungeon 
Way down in the mine",Dark as a Dungeon

A fireball of lightning that shook all our hills 
Who are these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves

Dolly Parton,"Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about the cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother
And I dreamed about the girl who's been waiting for long.

I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.

Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars, by night I ake the bars
If only they could read between the lines.

I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.

Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on the south-bound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones
The ones that I left waiting so far behind.

I want to go hoe, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.",Detroit City

The green ones for living with
The black ones tryin' to be a skinny one

We're all the same whatever we do

You know me and then
Still can't figure out the scene I'm in

That doesn't like the short man
For being such a rich one
That will not help the poor one

'Cause I know this could never work out 
But honey, how love grows

This can never be

Dolly Parton,"Ooh, but love was just so hard to find
'Til you came along into my life
And then I thought I would lose my mind
When you said that you wanted to be mine

And ever since that day I've been hooked
Nothin' can turn me away
This livin' with you is like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday

Ooh, I'm reachin' the highest of highs
Every time I look into your eyes
You ask how I feel, I can say it out loud
I feel like a million inside

I never thought this could happen to me
You got me just where you wanted me, baby
And for your love I would do anything
Every night I'm a fool for your love

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough

Drivin' home from this sleepy old town
When my day's work is all through
The sun and the lights, well, I wish I could fly
To get back faster to you

I waited all day by the telephone
Starin' at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to hold you

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough

Ooh, you're givin' me chills up my spine
I'm feelin' so fine, goin' out of my mind
And I don't care if it never stops
I'll love you right up until I drop

You know I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough

Dolly Parton,"That year the spring was six months long and love
Could do no wrong for love to open up the answers
The sun was stapled to the sky a junior prom July
And we at center stage where the dancers.

I knew you when the air was cold I'm there again
My dress was blue and it lay across the chair
Cause I love you I knew you well your heart
Could melt like caramel your eyes was deep like
The sun muddy stream where that tadpole stream
Child begin child you sleep

That year the fog would climb the beach and wrapped
Us out in preach from search lights that the sky
Would sending

I knew you first, I knew you best, I knew from the rest,
I knew you when the spring was ending

But in my pray I will you see to remain the time

Dolly Parton,"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who 
I use to take comfort from long before I met you 
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire 
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire 
Old flames can't hold a candle to you 
No one can light up the night like you do 
Flickering embers of love 
I've known one or two 
But old flames can't hold a candle to you 

Sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known 
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone 
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone 
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn 

Old flames can't hold a candle to you

Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye

I've been saving all my secrets, spending my time alone
I've given up on the life I used to know
I've been waiting for one person to love me like a friend

That kind of need that keeps a person sleepless
All that dreaming just the same

I'm not so sure I like it
But I feel it consume it be

And leave me wanting more right here on the brink
Well, your time just ran out I've got to hide it all
What are you waiting for

I'm too afraid to think what this thing is
I'm not so sure I like it that expenses just killing me

And all that you can show me is the prairie and the sky 
I don't want to hear a sad story filled with heartbreak and desire 
The last time I felt like this 
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire 
And I stood on the mountain in the night 
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn, I watched it burn 

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
I would hold my life in a saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, see your face 

Well you really got me this time 
And the hardest part is knowing I survive 
And I've come to listen to the sounds of trucks 
As they moved out on Highway 95 
And pretending it's the ocean coming to wash me clear

In the fall I could see our love was changing
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done

And home was on a hillside forty miles from Poplar Bluff

[Chorus:]
Forty miles back in Missouri there's a different way of life
Where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
Life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Poplar Bluff

Our only family treasure was a beat up radio
But it took us to the places where we knew we'd never go
We never had much money but we always had enough
'Cause money never mattered much forty miles from Poplar Bluff

[Chorus:]
Well nearly every winter when the snow is on the ground
And the roads would all be closed and we couldn't get to town

Just between you and me you're too much to forget

Take away the rain.

Take away the grey skies,
Hello love of mine
Happy days are coming my way,
Bring on the sunshine

No more sorrow is going to find me
I have made my last mistake
And once I get him, right here beside me
I'm gonna give him all the love he'd care to take

Take away the rain

Dolly Parton,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.

Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!
Lord! she said, casey can you only stay a while? 

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the golden crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.

Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,
Now she said, now that you've a fam'ly of your own;
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body!
Lord! she said casey it's a shame to be alone!",Casey's Last Ride
Dolly Parton,"When I look out over a green field of clover 
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day 
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain 
Or see April showers bring flowers to May 
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm 
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away 
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger 
The storm's even beautiful in its own way 

When I see leaves drop off from the treetop 
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day 
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder 
God made all things beautiful in their own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way, in its own way, in its own way",Everything's Beautiful (In Its Own Way)

Although you're with somebody new 
Thought I'd drop a line to say 
That I wish this happy day 
Would find me beside you

Seems like years ago we met 
On a day I can't forget

I was your pretty 
You were my baby

Dolly Parton,"I wake up in the morning with my arms around my pillow
Then suddenly I realize, I only hold a pillow
You're not there, you're not there

I call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallway
To return alone confirming all I've known for so long
I'm alone you're still gone

Still half asleep I stumble to the kitchen for my coffee
My footsteps match my heartbeats, funny heartbeats on linoleum
The sounds all wrong you're still gone

The sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait forever
And understanding saves don't stand by empty graves
You're on your own all alone, she's still gone

The town that's got me down to my last dime 
And everywhere I go, the people seem in such a hurry 
To keep this Mobile girl from feelin' fine 

[Chorus]
Lord, what I'd give to see an Alabama sundown 
The sun just seemed to drop in Mobile Bay 
New York town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down 
But that never was the Mobile way, no, no 
That never was the Mobile way 

A flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar 
In anybody's town, that price is cheap 
It's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards 
Cause I need ninety cents to go to sleep 

[Chorus]

I felt so big the day I left that Mobile couldn't hold me 
I thought there had to be a better way 
But if I could find that man that first called Lady Luck a lady 
That gentleman would surely learn to pray

And I'm freezing to death without you to keep me warm
I hold an arm full of nothing close to my side
And sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
Sometimes an old memory gets in my eye

The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams 
And anything is possible for those who can believe 
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities

We've got to try a little harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work 

It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye 
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try 
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue 
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you 

For us to make love work 
We've got to try a little bit harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work 

Oh I do believe in miracles 
But I know they don't come easy 
So why don't we give destiny 
A helping hand 

For us to make love work 
We've got to try a little bit harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work

To spend it feeling hurt

And you use it to bait me

When they tell me don't touch you 
I tell them I'll die 

In your red hot screaming love 
In your red hot screaming love 

If I'm losing my senses 
They're lost in your deepest emotions 
And the jets in my heart 
They won't start till you set them in motion 
Something tells me go 
Everyone says no, no, no 
How can they be so cruel 
When they tell me don't touch you 
I tell them I'll die

I cry but my word's my only witness

He's sweet and kind and he's mine all mine.
He treats me good like a lover should and makes me love him,
I really, really love him, 
Oh, I love him so,
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
 
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my other lover.
He treats me bad, makes me sad,
Makes me cry but sill I can't deny that I love him,
I really, really love him,
Oh I love him so, 
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
 
Darling, Well, Don'tcha know that I can tell whenever I look at you,
That you think that I'm untrue,
'Cause I said that I love two,
But I really, really do.
'Cause you're a split personality.
And in reality, both of them are you.
 
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,

Dolly Parton,"The gates and doors were barred 
And all the windows fastened down 
I spent the night in sleeplessness 
And rose at every sound 
Half in hope of sorrow 
And half in fear the day 
Would find the soldiers breakin' through 
To drag us all away 
And just before the sunrise 
I heard something at the wall 
The gate began to rattle 
And a voice began to call 
I hurried to the window 
Looked down into the street 
Expecting swords and torches 
And the sound of soldiers' feet 

But there was no one there but Mary 
So I went down to let her in 
John stood there beside me 
As she told me where she'd been 
She said they've moved Him in the night 
And none of us know where 
The stone's been rolled away 
And now His body isn't there 

We both ran towards the garden 
Then John ran on ahead 
We found the stone and empty tomb 
Just the way that Mary said 
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in 
Was just an empty shell 
And how or where they'd taken Him 
Was more than I could tell 

Oh something strange had happened there 
Just what I did not know 
John believed a miracle 
But I just turned to go 
Circumstance and speculation 
Couldn't lift me very high 
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him 
Then I saw Him die 

Back inside the house again 
The guilt and anguish came 
Everything I'd promised Him 
Just added to my shame 
When at last it came to choices 
I denied I knew His name 
And even if He was alive 
It wouldn't be the same 

But suddenly the air was filled 
With a strange and sweet perfume 
Light that came from everywhere 
Drove shadows from the room 
And Jesus stood before me 
With His arms held open wide 
And I fell down on my knees 
And I just clung to Him and cried 

Then He raised me to my feet 
And as I looked into His eyes 
The love was shining out from Him 
Like sunlight from the skies 
Guilt in my confusion 
Disappeared in sweet release 
And every fear I ever had 
Just melted into peace 

He's alive yes He's alive 
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive yes He's alive 
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive He's alive 
Hallelujah He's alive 
He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive He's alive He's alive 
I believe it He's alive 
Sweet Jesus",He's Alive
Dolly Parton,"Tonight I feel a chill in the air 
As cold as that look on your face 
I hear what you're saying but coming from you 
Goodbye seems so out of place 
Now how can you stand there and honestly say 
There never wee any real promises made 

[Chorus:] 
The moon is my witness 
The stars will agree 
They all heard you promise 
You'd always love me 
I know that it's true 
But it's hard to believe 
You lied to the moon 
The stars and me 
And what about all of those warm tender nights 
Did they mean nothing to you 
And where are the feelings I thought that we shared 
Or have you forgotten them too 
Did you think I could just put your memory behind 
When your words are still so very clear in my mind 
Chorus: 
The moon is my witness

Dolly Parton,"Well this big city life is gettin' me down 
There's just too many people around 
There's dirt in the air and crime in the street 
High-rise buildings and cold concrete 
This rat race sure enough takes a toll 
I want to run off to my fishin' hole 
Take me back take me back 
Take me back to the country 
Take me back take me back 
Take me back to the country 

Where the stars at night 
Outshine those city lights 
Take me back to the country 
Where the eagles fly 
And the treetops touch the sky 
Take me back to the country 

This traffic jam is makin' me mad 
I miss the simple life I had 
Peace and quite runnin' free 
I want to go home to my family 
I'm sick of the clock, sick of the phone 
Out in the country my time's my own 
Take me back take me back 
Take me back to the country

Dolly Parton,"I've been around for you, been up and down for you
But I just can't get any relief
I swallowed my pride for you, I've lived and lied for you
But you still make me feel like a thief

You've got me stealing your love away, 'cause you never give it
Peeling the years away, we can't relive it
I make you laugh and you make me cry, I believe it's time for me to fly

Time for me to fly, got to set myself free
That's how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly

You said we'd work it out, you said that you had no doubt
I thought we were really in love
Oh but I'm tired of holding on to a feeling I know is gone
I do believe I've had enough

I've had enough of the falseness of a worn out relation
Enough of this jealousy and intoleration
I wonder why I even try, I believe it's time for me to fly

Time for me to fly, I've got to set myself free
That's just how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly, time for me to fly

Time for me to fly, I've got to set myself free
That's just how it's got to be

I believe it's time for me to fly

I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly

In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that
Here comes my baby
Draggin' my heart behind
He's drivin' me crazy
Who says love is blind
He's got a wanderin' eye and a travelin' mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine

Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunney sack
Why you're almost givin' me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that

I just can't stand it
To see him on the town
He's out slow dancing
With every girl around
I'm a softhearted woman he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide

Streaks across my room 
And I'm wakin' up 
From another dream of you 
Yes, you know I'm on the road 
Once again it seems 
All that's left behind 
Is a chain of broken dreams 

But you know that I love you 
You know that I love you 
Oh, I love you 

And how I wish that love 
Was all we'd need to live 
What a life we'd have 
'Cause I've got so much to give 
But ya' know I feel so sad 
Down inside my heart 
That the dollar sign 
Should be keepin' us apart 

But you know that I love you 
You know that I love you 
Oh, how I love you 

And if only I could find my way back to the time 
When the problems of this life 
Had not yet crossed my mind 
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes 
I'd come runnin' back to you 
I'd come runnin' back to you 

But you know we can't 
Live on dreams alone 
Got to pay the rent 
So I must leave you all alone 
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago 
And now this travelin' life 
Well, it's the only life I know 

But you know that I love you

Cause they've never been out on their own

And the kids are all grown 
And the whole world cries

He's scheming big deals with one of his friends 
While she sits at home 
Just sorting out pieces 
Of left over memories 
From thirty odd years

You've never been out on your own 
Starting over again 
Never any end

Facing fifty years old 
Making up a happy home 
And this far down the road 
You find yourself alone

Sooner or later every heart needs some company 
When you think about love, think about me

Oh what's a heart to do 
'Cause it lingers 
And the thought of you

Dolly Parton,"The first noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee;
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.",The First Noel

Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born

Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Savior's birth

To hold your hand like I used to, I'm through with you
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man but you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along right with you, you said
""I need you"", then you changed the words and added harmony
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new

Oh, but nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel things are right
When I know they're wrong, nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing your song sweet music man, travel the world
With a six piece band that does for you what you tell 'em to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you

Sing your song sad music man, makin' your living
Doing one night stands, they're through with you
They don't need you, you're still a heck of a singer but a broken man
But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to

Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along and nobody else
Can make me feel things are right when they're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you

In your big, black fancy car

And beat a path right to my door 
Do I have to draw you a map

His clothes were torn and tattered
With sandals on his feet
And I stopped to help him
And lend him a hand
He said, I love you so much
But you must understand

Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world
They won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

And he said to me, let's rest for awhile
For I have some good news to share with you, child
He said, you can't change this old world
The people need to know
That a dear savior died here
A long, long time ago

Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world
They won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

His eyes shown like diamonds
And his smile was heaven sent
His hair was long and flowing
And his back was slightly bent
And I knew he knew it
For that day I changed
As I watched him walk on
I forgot to get his name

He said, silver and gold can't buy you a home
When this life has ended
And your time is gone
But you can live in a world where
You'll never grow old
And things can't be bought there with silver and gold

And time can't be bought back with silver and gold",Silver and Gold

I thought I saw the promise of forever in your eyes 
I thought that I was sure of what I saw 
You led me to believe that I was special in your life 
So I left my heart wide open for the fall 

I thought I'd found a safe and loving place inside your heart; 
And I was warm and willing any time 
The same soft lips that kissed me sweet were lying from the start 
But I swear I thought your love was genuine 
What a heartache you turned out to be 

What a heartache, what a heartache, 
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep 
Oh, what a heartache, what a heart break, 
Love ain't always what it appears to be 
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be 

It just goes to show that you never can tell 
'Cause I really thought that I knew you well 
I still can't believe I could be deceived so easily 
Are all these wishes I'm wishin' to myself 
Just rusty coins in a wishin' well? 
Wishes come true, they come false as well 
It's too late for you and me 
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be 

What a heartache, what a heartache, 
Love is two-faced and easy to deceive 
Oh, what a heartache, what a heartache, 
What a mistake to think I could believe 
What a heartache, what a heartache,

And I'm, I'm as blue as can be 
I treated him a-wrong 
And now I'm, I'm all alone 
I took him for granted 
She took him from me 

Well if I had known then 
Just what I know now 
I would've treated him so differently 
And if I, if I had known 
Well then I 
I could've shown him more love 
Than he'll ever see from her 

I thought I had his love 
In the palm of my hand

Dolly Parton,"You've seen me naked in more ways than one
You've seen me done up, seen me come undone
We've cried in the darkness, we've laughed in the sun
We've been forever, yet we've just begun

We've come full circle, all the way 'round
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends

And you know the soft spots under my skin
Deep down inside me, where no one has been
We've sailed troubled waters, we've soared on the wind
But time's only sweetened this love that we're in

And we've come full circle, all the way 'round
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends

Dolly Parton,"Sweet little cherry blossom, blooming before her time
Moving her lips to her favorite song, cherishing every rhyme
Swaying her hips to the rhythm, humming along with the tune
Lost in her own little dream world, slow dancin' with the moon

Watching her, I cannot help but go back in my mind
And suddenly I find, I am 15 again

Slow dancing with the moon
Oh, the stars got in my eyes long time ago
And I've lived my life like a love sick clown in a bittersweet cartoon
Just a dreamy-eyed kid slow dancin' with the moon

Watching the girl I'm reminded, she's quite a lot like me
Trapped in the suburbs of wonderland, lost in her own fantasy
Somehow my heart never grew up, no one ever burst my balloon
So here I am swirling in star dust, slow dancin' with the moon

Still believe someday my wildest dreams will all come true
And I'll find someone who'll make me 15 again

But until then I'm slow dancin' with the moon
Oh, the stars got in my eyes, long time ago
And I've lived my life like a love sick clown in a bittersweet cartoon
Just a dreamy-eyed kid, slow dancin' with the moon
Still a starry-eyed kid, slow dancin' with the moon

Skin shades of ivory, red, yellow and dark 
Well, my eyes saw colors their little hearts could not see 
They were playing together, why can't we

And swords became plowshares 'cause there were no enemies

You can always go downtown 
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry 
Seems to help, I know, downtown

Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty 
How can you lose? 
The lights are much brighter there 
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares 

And go downtown 
Things'll be great when you're downtown 
No finer place for sure, downtown 
Everything's waiting for you 

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you 
There are movie shows, downtown 
Or maybe you know some little places to go to 
Where they never close, downtown 

Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin' 
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin' 
Happy again 
The lights are much brighter there 
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares 

And go downtown 
Where all the lights are bright, downtown 
Waiting for you tonight, downtown 
You're gonna be alright now 

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you 
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along

To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you

Pretending that I'm doing well 
My need is such I pretend too much 
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

I find myself alone when each day's through 
Yes I admit it, I am a fool for you 
Because you're mine I walk the line 

As sure as night is dark and day's light 
I keep you on my mind both day and night 
And happiness I've known proves that it's right 
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You give me cause for love that I can't hide

To everything

Turn, turn, turn

There is a season

Turn, turn, turn

And a time to every purpose under Heaven

A time to be born, a time to die

A time to plant, a time to reap

A time to kill, a time to heal

A time to laugh, a time to weep


To everything

Turn, turn, turn

There is a season

Turn, turn, turn

And a time to every purpose under Heaven


A time to build up, a time to break down

A time to dance, a time to mourn

A time to cast away stones

A time to gather stones together


To everything

Turn, turn, turn

There is a season

Turn, turn, turn

And a time to every purpose under Heaven


A time of love, a time of hate

A time of war, a time of peace

A time you may embrace

A time to refrain from embracings


A time to gain, a time to lose

A time to rend, a time to sew

A time to love, a time to hate

A time of peace, I swear it's not too late

Reaching for the feeling that was always there 
You were the best thing in my life, I can recall 
You and me, we had it all 

I know that we can never live those times again 
But I let my dreams take me back to where we've been 
And I stay there with you just as long as I can 
Oh it was so good 
It was so good 
It was so good when you were my man 

But I'll never stop believing in your smile 
Even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while 
You were the best thing in my life I can recall

In this wide wicked world had never met
For the pain and the pleasures he's brought me
I am sure I will never forget

And when I think I'm able to
Well, I might try to be
Your friend again

But I'm always dying anyway

Stay, and I can't take the pain
I know we've tried to no avail
Our heaven now has
Turned to hell
The same old hurt
We know so well
And something's got
To change

We both know it's got to end
The passion's gone
It's just pretend
And one of us have got
To make the move
We might as well just give it up
We've lost respect and
There's no trust
And without this, there's
No real love
It's just some sad excuse

I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And there's nothing left but walk away
Ain't this a crying shame
A change of pace
A change of heart
A change of place
A place to start
And we'll be better off apart
Our only chance is change

And we never wil
But something has to change

But someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Then I will try to be your friend again

Let's two step to a new step 
We'll keep it all in line 
And we'll call this the Romeo 
'Cause you're so mighty fine 

Romeo, Romeo, Romeo come dance with me 

And that sexy little body 
Beats all I've ever seen 
I ain't never seen a cowboy 
Look that good in jeans 
My temperature keeps risin' 
Every time we meet 
I may not be in love 
But let me tell you 
I'm in heat 

Romeo, Romeo, I just know I'll get you yet 
Romeo, Romeo, I want to be your Juliet 

So step it high, step it low 
Step it out and in 
Step to the side and let it slide 
Then steppin' up again 
Step on toes, it all goes 
Steppin' as you please 
But I'm one step away from love 
So don't step out on me 

Romeo, Romeo, Romeo with the magic feet 

So step it high, step it low 
Step it out and in 
Step to the side and let it slide 
Then steppin' up again 
Step on toes, it all goes 
Steppin' as you please 
But I'm one step away from love

Won't you be my Juliet

Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, I've been smiling lately
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Someday it's going to come

'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Peace train take this country
Come take me home again

And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true

Why can't we live in bliss

Dolly Parton,"Darling will your love be mine forever always always
Will you keep those vows we made together always always
Will your love be as strong if my dreams should all go wrong always always
Darling will you stay with me forever always always
Will your love remain through stormy weather always always
Will your love be strong enough
To walk the roads that might get rough always always
In return of your love I'll be true as stars above always always
And the love that I feel will forever be so real always always","Always, Always"
Dolly Parton,"An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you
A solid gold mansion, an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold

May the comforts I praise be yours love

And the arms that I seek be yours love

May the Lord's shining grace be yours love
May the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips

As life from me slips be yours love
And from this moment on
May a love that is strong
That lives on and on be yours love",Yours Love

Lord, don't he make me proud

Hangin' all over me in a crowd

Lord, don't he make me smile

Lay your head upon my pillow 
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine

Blowing soft against the window

She shouted back at me 

Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun

I get kind of moody when I see such beauty 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain 
Or see April showers bring flowers to May 
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm 
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away 
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger 
The storm's even beautiful in its own way 

When I see leaves drop off from the treetop 
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day 
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder 
God made all things beautiful in their own way

They shone beneath his blue eyes

""Why don't you go home 
To your mommy,"" I said
And this was the maiden's reply
""Mommy's in heaven 
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone""

Mommy got sick 
Angels took her away 
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come 
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight

To ring the church bell
And found them 
Beneath the snow white

Your arm was restin' on her shoulder 
You smiled at her, she smiled at you 
Her eyes were filled with victory 
She said my brother wants to marry 
And then my heart was filled with ease 
I knew that you would marry me 

Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby 
You looked at her, you looked at me 
I knew that you would marry me 
I don't believe you've met my baby",I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby
Dolly Parton,"I get no kick from champagne 
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all 
So tell me why should it be true? 
That I get a kick out of you 
Some people go for cocaine 
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff 
That would bore me terrifically too 
Still I get a kick out of you 

I get a kick every time I see you 
Standin' there before me 
I get a kick though it's clear to see 
You obviously don't adore me, aww 

I get no kick in a plane 
Flying too high with some guy in the sky 
Is my idea of nothin' to do 
Still I get a kick out of you 
Yes I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick Out of You

And by faith we can see it afar 
For the Father waits over the way

In the sweet by and by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore 
In the sweet by and by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore 

We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
The melodious songs of the blessed 
And our spirit shall sorrow no more 
Not a sign for the blessing of rest

Dolly Parton,"There are stars in the southern sky 
Southward as you go 
There is moonlight and moss in the trees 
Down the seven bridges road 
I have loved you like a baby 
Like some lonesome child 
I have loved you in a tame way 
And I have loved you wild 
Sometimes there is a part of me 
Has to turn from here and go 
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars 
Down the seven bridges road 

There are stars in the southern sky 
And if ever you decide you should go 
There is a taste of time sweet as honey 
Down the seven bridges road 
There are stars in the southern sky 
Southward as you go 
There is moonlight and moss in the trees 
Down the seven bridges road

Dolly Parton,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying the stairway to heaven",Stairway to Heaven

Some chewing gum and candy, some magazines and snacks, 
Some startin' over money that I've been holdin' back, 
A change of clothes and notepad to write a letter back to say so long 
A one-way ticket sayin' good-bye to everything 
Threw my weddin' band out the window of the train 
All I want's my freedom, reclaim my maiden name 
I'm movin' on 'cause I'm gone 

You can tell the truth or you can lie 
You can say I left you or I died 
Say I'm in the Himalayas on some spiritual quest 
And could spend years lookin' for the light 
Say I'm in the witness program with the F.B.I., 
Say a U.F.O. abducted me from home 
You can say what you chose, but I tell you the truth 
You can say for sure I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone 

You think that you're above me, like I'm not good enough 
You make me feel unwanted, unwelcome and unloved 
You're selfish, vain and greedy; you're hateful, rude and rough 
And you're so wrong 
But you'd rather live unhappy and tolerate the pain 
Than separate and have me takin' half of everything 
Well, I'm leavin' your possessions, left on the good-bye train, 
Left you alone 'cause I'm gone 

You can have the house, the car, the boat, 
My records, books and stereo, 
The dog and the cat, my ceramic shop out back, 
My doll collection and my clothes 
You can keep all our friends and all the pictures in the den, 
And the fluffy pillows you sleep on 
But when you lay your head on that big feather bed 
You can rest assured I'll be gone; I'll be gone 

You can tell the truth or you can lie 
You can say I left or I died 
Say I'm in the Himalayas on some spiritual quest 
And could spend years lookin' for the light 
Say I'm in the witness program with the F.B.I. 
Say a U.F.O. abducted me from home 
Well, you can say what you chose, but I tell you the truth 
You can say for sure I'm gone 
You can say what you like, but I'll tell you twice 
You can say for sure, say for sure I'm gone, gone 

Some chewing gum and candy, magazines and snacks, 
Startin' over money I've been holding back, 
Change of clothes and notepad to write a letter back to say so long

If a face could launch a thousand ships, 
Then where am I to go? 
There´s no one home but you,

And when my love for life is running dry, 
You come and pour yourself on me 
If I could be two places at one time, 
I´d be with you 

Tomorrow and today, 
Beside you all the way 
If the world should stop revolving 
Spinning slowly down to die, 

I´d spend the end with you 
And when the world was through, 
Then one by one the stars would all go out, 
Then you and I would simply fly away

Then why can´t I paint you?

By the dawn's early light 
What so proudly we hailed 
At the twilight's last gleaming? 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, 
Through the perilous fight 
O'er the ramparts we watched, 
Were so gallantly streaming? 
And the rocket's red glare, 
The bombs bursting in air 
Gave proof through the night 
That our flag was still there

O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?",The Star Spangled Banner

Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill

Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that

Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee

Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will

Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top

Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity

I use to take comfort from long before I met you 
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire 
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire 
Old flames can't hold a candle to you 

No one can light up the night like you do 
Flickering embers of love 
I've known one or two 
But old flames can't hold a candle to you 

Sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known 
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone 
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone 
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn 

Old flames can't hold a candle to you

And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now 
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange they shake their heads, they say
I've changed
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
Dolly Parton,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

[Chorus]
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la,
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

[Chorus]

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

[Chorus]

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

[Chorus]",Those Were the Days
Dolly Parton,"You ask me how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the Twelfth of Never
I'll still be loving you

Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover
Has lost it's perfume
And I'll love you 'til the poets
Run out of rhyme
Until the Twelfth of Never
And that's a long, long time

Hold me close
Never let me go

Dolly Parton,"Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on a summer from a slot machine
Yes, you can get what you want, if you want it
'Cause you can get anything

I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?

Well, you roll on roads over fresh green grass
With your heavy loads pumping petrol gas
And you make 'em long and you make 'em tough
And you just go on and on and it seems you can't get off

I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?

Crack the sky, scrapers fill the air
But you keep on buildin' higher
'Til there's no more room up there?

Will you make us laugh?
Will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live?
Will you tell us when to die?

I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Tell me where do the children play?

Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
But, where do the children play?
Just tell me where do the children play?

Dolly Parton,"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta""
Well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta

Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta

Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down

Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites

Now i wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
That day my mama socked it to the harper valley pta

'Cause I'll tell a joke or two.
Although I might be laughin' loud and hearty,
Deep down inside I'm blue.

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place.
If you'll look closer,
It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.

I need you, need you.
But since you left me if you see me with another guy,
Seemin' like I'm havin' fun.
He might look good it's true
But he's a substitute 'cause you were the perfect one.

[Chorus]

I need you, I need you.

Outside I'm masqueradin',
'Cause inside my hope is fading.
Like a clown since you put me down,
And my smile is my makeup I wear since my break up with you.

Dolly Parton,"In the airport lounge, he sat with his cane and durby hat 
The grandest man that I had ever seen 
Outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes 
So I asked him if he'd like some company 
In my rhinestone-studded suit 
And my cowgirl high-heel boots 
I must have been a site for him to see 
But he said, ""Pull up a chair"" 
As I fumble with my hair 
A more unlikely pair you'll never see 
I was Mogan David wine 
He was Chablis fifty-nine 
But there we sat 
The cowgirl and the dandy 
He was ski resorts in Aspen 
And summers in Paris 
I was Grand Ole Opry Nashville, Tennessee 
The cowgirl and the dandy 
As different as can be 
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee 
Then somewhere in between 
His Harvey's Bristol cream 
And the beer that I kept sippin' at his table 
We somehow came together for a night of stormy wheater 
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cabin 
An' there's a little country in the dandy 
The cowgirl and the dandy 
As different as can be 
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee

Dolly Parton,"A violet fell in love with a rose
And started it flashing from its head to its toes
Then one day the rose was kissed by the dew
A new love was born and the violet turned blue

Roses are red violets are blue
I'm sending red red roses to you
If you care to send some flowers to me
Then send me some violets I'm blue as can be

I wanted my love to bouquet with you
Just like the rose you've proven untrue
A flower that's wild they say has no home
And just like the violet I'm left all alone

Roses are red violets are blue...

Dolly Parton,"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone

Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure
Country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
A country heart and a country head
'Cause I'm country to the core

Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives

Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low

I'm countrified and I'm country-fed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe

And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through

Dolly Parton,"Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now

When your roof's too close at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You are the reason I'm traveling home
Don't think twice, it's alright

There ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That night, I never know'd
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road

Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
We never did do much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright

But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
'Cause I can't hear you anymore

Well, I'm thinking and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright

Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound well I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a way, babe
So I'm gonna say thee farewell

But I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind
But you just kinda sorta wasted my precious time

Dolly Parton,"Lookin' outta my windowpane
Tears minglin' with the rain
I'm so lonesome I could cry, just like old Hank
Starin' down on the city street
Feelin' empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be to fill my tank
A place I can go where I can be free
Where I can be happy and I just be me
Ho-o-ome
Where the warm wind's blowin' and the river's flowin' along
Like a lazy bum in the midday sun
And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome home
I left home I was seventeen
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true, I've had good luck
I ain't complain' that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful for
One of those things is a magic door that opens up
Back to the time when I was a kid
To the sounds of crickets and the katydids
It's called ho-o-ome
On the front porch swingin'
And the fern pots hangin'
Ho-o-ome
With the church bells ringin'
And voices singin'
Those old songs that mend my mind like a stitch in time
Where the tea is sweet and the love complete
Oh me, I wanna go ho-o-ome
I often think about where I have been
Where I am goin' and that's about when I think about
Ho-o-ome
Where the soul finds comfort and the heart finds pleasure
Ho-o-ome
Where the depths of love is hard to measure
It's ho-o-ome
I hear you callin', I hear you callin'
I'll never be lost as long as I know
There's place like that where I can go
Where I can restore my weary soul
On the mountain slopes in the soft blue smoke
Of ho-o-ome
Home sweeet home. Ho-o-ome
Back to the hills with the whippoorwills
Of ho-o-ome
With the fireflies blinkin' and the night stars winkin'
Ho-o-ome
Honeysuckle vine and Muscadine wine
At ho-o-ome
Where the ginseng grows in the shady groves of ho-o-ome
With family and friends and joy that never ends
Ho-o-ome
There's no place like it, no place like it
Ho-ome",Home

Dolorean,"I had a true love from Hannibal
Where the Mississippi turns flat and wide
We'd lay out on the sandbars 
And fall asleep to the barges and the fireflies
And I killed my true love from Hannibal
She was nineteen and I was twenty-two
Summer was ending and she was leaving soon 
To study writing on the east coast
And I worked in my father's shop 
Fixing air conditioners and heating pumps
Going to college never made much sense to me 
I wanted to keep my true love close to me

The summers are hot in Hannibal 
The summers there are unbearable
So we'd steal down to the water's edge 
And cool off in the river's ebb
One night we decided what we would do 
Swim to the middle ‘til our strength gave out
Where the current was strong and deep 
Together we'd be pulled down to sleep
So we swam ‘til our bodies were weak
I watched my true love get washed out to sea
I felt a terrible grip from beneath
The river took her but it didn't take me

In St. Louis there's a prison cell 
It'll be twelve more years ‘til I get out
When I do her father says he'll shoot me down 
If I don't do it myself

Most days I just try and sleep 
I dream of Hannibal when it was in between
It's not quite day and it's not yet night

And fevered in a bed 
Would you read from the scriptures? 
Repeat what the prophets said?

But I still think it's love
I still think it's love",The Light Behind My Head
Dolorean,"Blow in through the door 
Like a ghost that is nice 
My crosshairs align and my grip is tight
My friends are bullets 
That I shot at tin cans
No feathers no wings 
No feet and no beaks 
And no place to land
No place to land

When you finally come home 
Don't be surprised 
If there's rust in my throat and red in my eyes
My friends are knives 
That cut out my tongue
No songs and no beats no words left to speak 
Just utters and grunts
Utters and grunts

Drive ten thousand miles 
Just to tear off your arm 
Just to play the guitar and recite a poem

That I dropped on the ground
They shatter and break 
And they always take 
Too long to come home
Too long to come home",So You're a Touring Band Now
Dolorean,"And you might be surprised 
By how much I love you
And the coals that burn white in my chest
And you might be surprised 
By how oft' I think of you
But ambition has encamped around me
Dark toothed obsession has taken your place

Open your eyes 
You are better than me
Selfish and pitied your man has become
You can't recognize 
I'm too far to be reached
And my gaze looks beyond your face
And my heart has turned greyed and dull

So do not love one 
Who can't love you as much
Go ahead and turn this dog loose
And do not think of one 
Who does not think of you

All those things you can't figure out
You've been chasing those dreams for so long now
But your devotion turns to doubt
And the people you hoped you would meet 
But you're still here with me

When you lay down by my side 
When the lights are all out
You've got no corners where you can hide 
Especially from yourself
And you kiss like a corpse 
And you smile like a crow
And my threads are too short 
When your wounds are exposed
And the places you hoped you would see 
But you're still here with me

And I sleep with your ghost 
The dotted outline of what you were
But what I miss most 
Is when you'd draw near
Cause this house would rattle and shake 
When we'd stay up late
And the grass was green and the glasses were clean
And these walls were covered with brand new white paint

She led me here 
Canadian plains 
To disappear
It started one night 
When I'd had too much 
Of being alone 
Of collecting dust
So I went to see her 
Like a thief in the night 
I gave her my death 
And stole from her life
And it killed me each time 
That I saw her man 
A friend of mine 
If you could call me a friend
And on Sunday morning 
The preacher preached on deceit 
He spoke of a fire 
Of unspeakable heat
So now I drive 
Cross frozen plains 
Nowhere to hide 
Just to escape

I traded it all 
To match my desire 
I traded it all 
I traded for fire
I traded for fire

And Father forgive me 
Because I knew 
What I was doing
I set a snare 
For myself and fell headlong 
Into ruin

To die
Burn my lips 
With coals and burn my insides",Traded for Fire

You're everywhere, baby
On my bike ride your hips are the hills
I can't escape you lately

I wanted to tell you
About a bright red bird that passed my train
But you're asleep tonight
And your tonight is my yesterday

And all those blues because there's no view
Of the city from your window
You've made a nest out of credit card bills
So honey, let the wind blow

My feet have grown so tired
My legs they ache each night
Because you know the hardest thing to do
Is to dance in step in each other's shoes

We drop the beat
We can't keep time
We're standing still
In my still life

Dolorean,"I drink one bottle of wine each night
To help me get over you
And I've grown quite fond of what
One bottle can do

Puts me sleep without a dream
Without a thought of anything
And when I wake day's half-way done
It's time to start another one

So, I drink one bottle of wine each night
To help me get over you
And I've grown quite fond of what
One bottle can do

And I go beyond where the tears come
Way past the urge to just pick up the phone
My mind's a blank it's better off that way
Whatever it takes to feel okay

So, I drink one bottle of wine each night
To help me get over you
And I've grown quite fond of what
One bottle can do

As the days go oh so slowly, as the sun shines oh so lowly, on the good and gracious green,
In the summer of my dreams, 
In the summer of my dreams!

Dolores Keane,"Underneath the lantern, by the barrack gate,
Darling I remember the way you used to wait.
'Twas there that you whispered tenderly,
That you loved me, You'd always be,
My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili Marlene.

Time would come for roll call, Time for us to part,
Darling I'd caress you and press you to my heart,
And there 'neath that far off lantern light,
I'd hold you tight, We'd kiss good-night,
My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili Marlene.

Orders came for sailing somewhere over there,
All confined to barracks was more than I could bear;
I knew you were waiting in the street,
I heard your feet, But could not meet,
My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili Marlene.

Resting in a billet, just behind the line,
Even tho'we're parted, your lips are close to mine.
You wait where that lantern softly gleams.
Your sweet face seems to haunt my dreams.
My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili Marlene.

Yo te enseñaré mi hermano

A ti te gusta la bomba
Y te gusta el baquiné
Para que goces ahora
Africano es el bembé

Che che colé, que bueno e
Che che cofriza, muerto 'e la risa

Oye tú sentado allá
Pareces venezolano
Ven aquí vamo' a bailar
Que todos somos hermanos

Lo bailan en Venezuela
Lo bailan en Panamá
Este ritmo es Africano
Y donde quiera vá acabar

Che che colé, que bueno e
Che che cofiza, muerto 'e la risa

Ya yo sé que te gustó
Quieres bailarlo otra vez
Bailalo en la punta del pie
Y veras que bueno es

Ya yo sé que te gustó
Quieres bailarlo otra vez
Pues ponte bien los zapatos
Que los tienes al revés

Che che colé, que bueno e
Che che cofiza, muerto 'e la risa

Domingo Quiñones,"Yo soy la fama
soy tristeza y sonrisa pagada
que con dinero se puede obtener
y escuchen por qué
doy placer y de regreso yo no pido nada
si es  trabajo llegar a la fama
y a la fama poder mantener.

No tengo amigos
y si un amor fácil lo consigo
así de fácil lo he de perder
Mi madre dijo: No creas ser un gran tenorio
pararás es un sanatorio
y allí fama todo has de perder.
 porque yo, yo soy la fama
soy aquel que la gente reclama
pero nadie puede comprender.

Cómo lo llevaron a crucificar

Si viéramos bien al mundo
Y a nuestros pueblos hermanos no existiera lo rotundo

Todos tenemos problemas
Que tienen su solución
Sin pensar que el de la muerte
De eso se encarga el Señor

No conoce el egoísmo ni actúa de mala fe

Ella va triste y vacia 
llorando una traicion con amargura 
por aquel que le decia 
que era su amor y su locura 
Ya la vida le ha enseñado demasiado 
cometer el mismo error no le interesa 
los amores que a tenido le fallaron 
y dejaron en el aire las promesas 
y dejaron en el aire las promesas.. 
Ella va triste y vacia 
llorando una traicion con amargura 
por aquel que le decia 
que era su amor y su locura 
va tratando de lograr lo que ha soñado 
aprovecha la experiencia de la vida 
va olvidando sufrimientos del pasado

Ella va triste y vacia 
llorando una traicion con amargura 
por aquel que le decia 
que era su amor y su locura 
por aquel que le decia 
que era su amor y su locura 
pero en todo este pasaje de la vida 
ha sabido mantenerse con decensia 
aunque muchos habladores la confundan 
aunque muchos traten de inventar con ella 
aunque muchos traten de inventar con ella 

Ella va triste y vacia 
llorando una traicion con amargura 
por aquel que le decia 
que era su amor y su locura

En su rostro se comprenden 
los fracasos de la vida

fue que todo el mundo le fallo 
y ella no lo merecia 

coro: ella va ..... 
por fracasos de la vida.. 

Asi es que muere un amor 
hay que nadie comprendia 
la promesa le fallaron 
los errores de sofia 
coro:ella va ........... 
a donde ira la pobre 
niña triste y desolada 
pero que cosa le harian 
coro:ella va............ 
caminaba tan orgullosa 
y de su dolor nadie sabia 
coro:ella va....... 
mirala que linda biene 
mirala que linda va 
a donde se esconderia 
coro:ella va........... 
yo la vi llorando yo la vi.

La sabrosura rica y sandunguera

La que el gran Gautier
Llamo la Perla de los Mares

Oye de Borinquén vengo yo
Por eso tengo salsa, sabor, y control

Y ven y baila la rica plena

En mi jibarita encuentro yo
Lo aretes que le faltan a la luna

Oye esa si tiene la masa buena
Mami que la masa dura
Por eso a mi mami la quiero

Masa dura con pan es lo que tú tienes
Masa dura con pan el negro te quiere tú ves

Esa tierra es mi locura

Essa estrada, esse rio seco
Essa dor que mora em mim
Não descansa e nem dorme cedo

É amar em segredo
Não quer saber de mim
E eu vivendo da tua vida
Deus no céu e você aqui
A esperança é quem me abriga
Esses campos não tardam em florir
Já se espera uma boa colheita
E tudo parece seguir

Mas e você o que faz

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur

In fields of dawn and forests of the night

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Dominic Balli,"I was just a boy when they told me 
What you gonna be and they sold me 
The American Dream for a small fee 
The price of my life and my own dreams 
What about a dream where the Kingdom comes 
Peace on the earth and his will be done 

What about a dream where the people fight 
Not for fortune and fame but for saving lives
She'll consume your future if you just let her be 
Hold the world a hostage From sea to shining sea
You can call her freedom, but she can't set you free 
And don't you dare disgrace her She's our American dream

American dream, I was never told that the high life 
Would demand my soul such a high price 
I've been drinking the Kool-Aid the whole time 
Believing the dream till it stole mine 
What about a dream where the people cry 
For the healing of a land both soul and mind 
What about a dream where the dream was changed 

Not for change sake but for the highest gain
They say cash rules everything around me it seems 
For thirty pieces of silver you can buy you a king 
And forfeit your soul become a slave to the machine 
Some would sell they're own momma for the American pipe dream 
Redemption disregarded to the good news imparted 
Exempt from consequence spiritual free-dumb to free-tarded 
Morally decayed selfish in my ways I live to get paid 
I'm so American made

American Dream (America the American Dream) 
American Dream (America my American Dream) 
American Dream (America the American Dream) 
American Dream (What does it cost for my American Dream)

Program me then program the future 
Program schools and program the teachers 
Program youth then program the future 
Then program me to think I can lose her 
Trap me hold me mind and my body 
Teach my feet to walk like Zombie 
Consume my life with the dollar sign 
Till I pledge my allegiance to lose my mind",American Dream

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Can't you see through the hollow vision that's right before your eyes?
Brainwashed by the fucking media, out of sight, out of mind

There is no truth, deceiving words, controlling vision, distorted perception
Is there a reason to survive, the monuments of instilled lies, the cage they have us all inside
The power of thought, they have the force, destroyed beliefs and altered course

Like whispers in the ocean the words went unheard
Like tears from the stars the warnings went ignored

Like tears from the stars the mother feeds her child

Unforeseen fate will pale reality, in fears eclipse we'll hear the world while it weeps

The flowers withered and life wept, but my body remained sleepless

The blinding light reveals your purity, this voyage here seems so tangible
I will hear them, I will hear the songs that were played from the birth of the first
Foolish embrace of a false esteem, the wind will turn
Call, I keep calling... Same hostility lies
In the depths of all our existence
Encapture time to find the other side, but it's all the same

And like the word your life unfolds, upon the tears for which you burn

Let go the guilt that dwells within, from which the torch was lit in sin
Come walk the road to find your true paradise

Nothing survives

I put down my mask
And I laugh into the shining sun
Bright it shines and it laughs back
What I've thought of yesterday
It is blown away by this pride

My sorrows, my fears
They all die in this shining brightness
All die in this shining pride
A discovery for the eyes
Of course the last one

One second to live
One thought remains
Is this unreal
Is this unreal
One second to live
One though remains
Is this unreal
Is this unreal

One second to live
One thought remains
Is this unreal
Is this unreal",Unreal

Dominique A,"«Nous n'irons pas plus loin», te dit le capitaine
Trop d'obstacles aujourd'hui pour gagner l'horizon
Des baleines épuisées gémissent sur la grève
Leur sang couvre des bouches comme autant d'hameçons

Comme autant de collines occultant l'horizon
De crêtes insensibles à l'adagio des plaines
« Je suis vraiment navré », te dit le capitaine
Et tu sens qu'il dit vrai et qu'il a le cœur bon.

Dès lors la bouche vermeille d'une femme au harpon
Qui entre dans tes murs et saigne les baleines
Te fait des mois durant dédaigner l'horizon
Et lorsque tu le croises snober le capitaine.

Quand tu rentres chez toi, tu te dis qu'il fait bon
Le mensonge est partout infiltré dans tes veines
Tant tu aimes goûter au sang de la baleine
Qui déborde des lèvres de la femme au harpon.

Mais un jour sur ta manche tire le capitaine
Les yeux exorbités, il te dit, ""Repartons"".
Il est temps de sortir du sommeil des reines
Car nul ne vous attend autant que l'horizon.

C'est Lob Nor qui t'espère, l'Inlandsis qui t'appelle
La Sierra Nevada qui la nuit crie ton nom
Et c'est la Grande Bleue qui rehausse le ciel
Chacun d'eux te réclame et t'offre l'horizon

Mais celui-ci t'échappe, stoppé dans son élan
Par des sommets hargneux, des vallées encaissées,
Des villes au cœur de pierre aux formes insensées
Vois, la barbe te pousse et ton pas se fait lent.

Et tu entends au loin les plaintes des baleines
Qui avant de finir sur la grève ont sans doute
Connu cet horizon dont seul le capitaine
Espère encore pour deux que tu croises la route.

Mais un jour au silence qui monte aux alentours
Comme tes yeux se décollent, tu sais qu'on t'a laissé
Seul avec ton vieux rêve dont l'ombre est un vautour
Qui dessous tes haillons sent la chair s'assécher

Et comme en de lents cercles, il va pour t'entreprendre
Le décor s'aplanit, les courbes se défont
Tout se dégage, oui, sans doute las de t'attendre
C'est lui qui vient à toi, il est là, l'horizon.",L' Horizon

Du long couloir en entonnoir
Où la foule se dévidait
Les robes ne tenant qu'à un fil
Et le trottoir mouillé, mouillé.

Il avance parmi les dunes
Gomina battue par le vent
Il pense qu'il est huit heures du soir
Et qu'il circule dans le couloir
Où les épaules bruissent en glissant
La foule se place au cœur des dunes
La mer applaudit bruyamment.

Près des machines qui cliquètent
En entrant, il voit la moquette

Des quelques vérités brassées
Il lui pardonne sans un effort
C'était trop vrai pour le toucher.

Ils s'embrassent, elle part travailler
Elle a le pardon du fantôme
Et l'espoir indéboulonné
L'amour se cabre dans le hall
Où le souvenir l'a condamné
Avec la grande tristesse bravache
Des fins de soirées déglinguées
Où les vêtements font relâche
Et le cœur est déshabillé.

Et sous les cieux gris qui s'inquiètent
Dans les dunes ou au Casino
Parmi les machines qui hoquètent
Il regarde, il voit des cerceaux
De feu qui brunissent la moquette
Et il voit tomber des rideaux
Des mains qui claquent dans la tempête
Au dehors.

Et il voit les lettres
Rouges, et le couloir cramoisi
Et tout le possible des nuits
Qui s'affiche, rouge, en toutes lettres
Et rien de tout ça n'est fini

Et tous les adieux s'y empêtrent
Comment dire adieu à la vie?

So flat ass is obsolete
And titties don't do it, even though they might be plump
I need a rump, the kind you can thump, so fuck her

And if it makes hits, this is much smoother
The wiggle, jiggle, jiggle, sex soother
I'm rollin' back, I'm tellin' ya now if you can't flaunt it
Take your ass home and work on it

But if you got butter on your biscuit then eat it
And, take it to my homies and feed 'em
'cause it's so good when them bitches try to serve it
Grade A beef, and it shake like it's nervous

I see some beef, take one glass
Then it turn to a spoon, put the nuts in they pants
See it at the mall and gotta grab it

I want that swole, word to Jimmy
Here's a little bit to think about Jack
Why, eat a pancake when you can have the whole stack?

I pick up, will call you when I get down
Don't you want it flat with a fat bumper too?
Well ain't that how you like it Mamacita?
With the boom-boom, dumpin' like Rosarita

With a place seein' ass, so do it
Remember, a serve from Domino is not the beauty but the potion
So, tap your heels like Dorothy or Doris

Switch it, in the night, in a tight dress
So grab Jimmy, I'm here to let you know
You think you drunk milk, the Jimmy starts to grow

Bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
Sort of like drinkin', a forty ounce of liquor
I know you heard of tales from the Crypt
Well, this is more better, tales from the hip

And this is not rated P-G
It's, rated triple X and it comes in 3-D
With a bit of that soda like a treasure
But if you strike gold then you know, you'll find pleasure

Like I trunk full of body you can pounce, it's
Really like Zapp with more bounce to the ounce

You can't handle it than give it to me

She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin
Gettin horrors, but then I busted a nut, and that was that
so kick the chorus

-Chorus-

My homies are down, chillin in the hood
Nuthin my bitches, but thet ain't no good
to another man well she might be some good cat
But the homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scared to love
So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll pound yo ass real fast, if your quick enough
And when your in that thi-ing
She'll make that nigga si-ng

But you don't hear me doe
Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya lyin

-Chorus-

My homey's clownin in his doped yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin out the funky big trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the store, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week 
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she towed in around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go

Money is everything, money is everything,
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money,
Money is everything

(2x)

[First Verse]
Now think about it, isn't it a coincidence
Everybody wants them dead presidents?
See those that don't have it love jackin' you head to toe
And people that's clockin' a grip, always eager to make more
'cause money can help your heart, and money can help you out
But if you're makin' too much of it, then money can help you die
And ain't that scary like Jason
You can't win for losin' 'cause of the grip that you're makin'
Now this particular paper is like the power to the greedy
And a God to the hungry, keepin' life in the needy
And so we're brainwashed thinkin' of it
But don't get me wrong, 'cause I love it
I used to like George Washington's way back when
Now I'm sprung on Benjamin Franklins
And with these people I could go on
Like so on, and so on, and so on, trip
Who bought your clothes and who bought your food?
Who bought your hoe and who bought your dude?
Cut the bullshit, tell me who you tryin' to kid?
'cause you didn't buy shit, your money did
Get the picture?

Chorus

[Second Verse]
There once lived a low-income woman with a child
Lookin' for single men with money she could date
Finally met a man that her daughter called Daddy
But homies comin' up short on the stakes
She let him be Daddy for awhile, 'cause the dicks good
Plus he's fine and all swole lookin' bounty
But that don't mean shit when you're broke and you're hungry
That's why daughter's Daddy's new name is Mr. County
Check, this out, they say it's the root of all evil
And I could truly say in this case
A friend of mine was makin' that big time lunch meat
But then he made a small time lunch meat mistake
'cause soon homie lost all his love for the small life
Forgot all of which he had came from before
And started gettin' greedy so another man sent a little bullet
And the bullet read ""My homie had to go""
'cause he thought....

Chorus

[Third Verse]
Now do you remember, when your elders used to scream
And tell you money ain't everything
They said it couldn't buy that, and it couldn't buy this
But money bought me everything that I'm gone get
Why is it, that all the fine freaks seem to jock it?
And it keeps me smilin' when I got it in my pockets?
Got a christmas treat for my kids and a tree seen
And yes to impress them hoochie females
And since it builds up my confidence
Hurry, hurry, for the dollars and cents
As far as it goes keep it comin', and
Oh how I like it in a woman
I like to see freaks when their hair is nice
With a good wig, tight clothes, sportin' fourteen K's
Now how in the Hell do you get it?
Money, money, money, money, money, so get with it
Now it's a shame when you lame as a zero
'cause blacks, whites, as well as mexicans want dinero
And why you tryin' to win the lottery?
'cause money's everything it's gotta be
So now you know

Chorus",Money Is Everything

I'm that guy, you're so fly,
Gotta get a piece of that sweet potato pie

Now the way of today with the homies is straight,
Gettin' fucked up off the dank, CHRONIC,
Bud, What, ever you want to call it,
It's peace to you fuckin' alcoholics, for,
Makin' the proper remedy,
'cause when I hit it, bitches envy me,
You say you want wine?  Yeah I guess that's fine,
But thai is the sky when you talkin' about mass,
Now my thai got a friend named Gin,
Got me all straight now my dick won't bend,
Now I'm fucked for the rest of the night,
Unless I find a piece of ass whether it's loose or tight,
Now looka here looka here I done found a bitch,
Yummy for the dick, Jelly mix in the switch,
Save that shit 'cause I don't want to be your man,
Just need a little loosin', do you understand?

Chorus:

My mind's fucked up off chocolate thai,
Hit the gin shop now I'm so high,
Now I need a bitch that's proper and fly,
So break me off a piece of that sweet potato pie  (2x)

Second Verse:

Thinkin' about what I'm gonna do today,
Party at my homies bout eight,
I thought about goin' to the movies,
But ain't nothin' like a bunch of proper ass hoochies,
Dressed like a player can't wear nothin' less,
Some simple ass shit, even if it ain't Guess,
Hit a couple of shots and now I roll to the spot,
Bitches straight peepin' want to know what I got, well,
One, two, three, Here comes the D,
Pass me the rotor....WHEW WEE!!!!
And now I'm ready for you bitches,
So gang a dick licker, do you get the picture?
And so much love for y'all gals,
And peace, love, and pussy to my muthafuckin' pals,
And ay, yai, yai, I'ma stay high,
And keep me a piece of that sweet potato pie

Third Verse:

The fellas want to have a barbeque tonight, I think it's on about five,
They say it's gonna have plenty dazzey duks, and Les says it's gonna be live,
So I'ma gonna grab me a plate of soup, 'cause ain't not a damn thing changed,
And now I'm proper when fly and shit, but man do I feel strange,
So I'ma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin,
And go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin,
And now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper niece,
And run a little game on the P.Y.G., and tell it to her somethin' like this:

Domino,"Now young bitches got it goin' on and here's a new thing,
She looks of twenty-one, but she's under eighteen,
Now picture a man with a plan, what's he gonna do?
She's only sixteen, but looks twenty-two,
And age isn't a factor 'cause she's fine to the dude,
And plus she's built like a truck there must be somethin' in her food,
Or her water,
Because she's somebody's daughter
Who's attractive to a son, as well their father's,
And they know this, that ass sticks with us,
And like my homie told me once she's quite bootylicious,
Watch your mouth drop with them dubs that she threw on,
Dandy like candy, so you can get your chew on,
What'cha want to do? What'cha gonna do?
When you find out that she's far from twenty-two?
Yo it's not the same G, when you game G,
With the dames drop a line like this before you do

Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.

What's up with these bitches tryin' to play us like a fool?
Lookin' of age real proper, but just enrollin' in high school,
I'm callin' 'em collard greens 'cause they're corn bread fed,
Runnin' more game than what your homie Simon said,
Yo what is this, new statistic?
Went from pants and vaseline to short skirts and lipstick,
You ask who to blame? I don't know but I'ma,
Take it upon myself, and blame it on they Mama,
For beatin' that ass with a baseball bat,
Swole it all up now it's proper and fat,
Fed 'em attitudes, Big Macs, and milk,
Leave 'em all alone and it's on in the jilt,
Or the house, 'cause that's where they open up they mouth,
So in the day she's a child, at night she's an adult,
And Diggity Domino I like to ride it like a tractor,
But there's a question at hand because that age is a factor

Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.

There was a man named Bill, on a Saturday night he went to a club,
And read a sign before he entered it saying ""eighteen and up"",
But we know that's just a game for the man, that's runnin',
Thangs 'cause he's lettin' all the fly bitches come in,
Regardless of the age and shit,
But since this story's about Bill let's get back to it,
Bill met a collard green, she looks mean,
Ran a little game now she's on the team,
You know what comes next, took her to the snooty,
Treated her like a salad, tossed up the booty,
Bill played it wrong, and he got lazy,
No protection, guess what, oopsy daisy!
Now baby's pregnant,
'Cause Bill neglected,
To be protected,
Now he's arrested,
One year under eighteen and you're through,
So if you're game drop a line like this before you do:

Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.",Do You Qualify

Now what makes the world go round besides checks?
Everybody give it to me S-E-X
Now with the proper equipment, it works best
And nothing less, relieves stress
Now if she says yes, you know I gotta knock it
Cause you saw me poppin like Orvell Redenbacher
In case you need a notion, Hennessey's the potion
Hit the climax if you want the sex lotion
CUM CUM now are you really that umm Dumb Dumb
On these cool procedures bout gettin some some 
Putang, when it comes to ""P"" I'm a ""G"" and 
Daddy never taught me bout the birds and the bees
But I, took a hint and with a little motion
Stuck it in a chick and had her flowin like an ocean
And now I gotta have it, just like a rabbit
Fuck Fuck Fuck with the semi-automatic

Now if I choose you lady, Baby Baby Baby
If you and I can practice making babies
But here's a little something that you should know
I don't test the rain without the raincoat
Now if you one of those who don't like a rubber on your lover
Then the niggie Domino can truly find another
Wait... for me to give you a sex shower
And the good thing about it is it don't take an hour
For me to go from attention to at ease
Baby, try to take an easy on me please
Sexy ass freak, your love is so sweet
But you can kill a man with the tip of your teeth
So not too slow and not too fast
And I like to see a sexy with a string in her ass
Now tell me, are you that chunk of the month?
Then maybe we can share a little Physical Funk

-Chorus-

So now you know, Physical Funk is the Pump
And the bump which I like to stunts
And this is how I do it, back in the hood
Can't seem to go without nature's feel good
Cause homies like to feel that wet up and down
And ladies like to feel it deep round and round
And just to put this bomb ass track in context
Everybody with me if you like sex

OOCHIE COOCHIE LA LA LA OOCHIE COOCHIE
OOCHIE COOCHIE LA LA LA OOCHIE COOCHIE

And nothing like liquid love between the sheets
And if your not a virgin then you'll agree
Its always so good when junks in your trunks

Domo Genesis,"When I talk about my son
I get overjoyed with emotion
But I feel empowered
Because, I tell you
When I first looked into his eyes
I knew he would be something special
He was so bright and so funny at the same time
I said there would be a day
When I would share him with the world
I just didn't know when
And that day has come, it's now
And I couldn't be more happy for him
I'm so proud
He's something special and I'm glad
He's getting a chance to show you what he is
Because I saw it a long time ago
I got you, no matter what
I'm there for you
And, um no matter what obstacles come your way
Always remember that you are gonna be you
And no one else can take that away from you
Remember that the stars and the sky is the limit
And once you reach those, you keep going
Just keep going and never look back
Because it belongs to you, it's your time
And I would always say that to you
Just always reach for the stars
So, I want you to know that I'm always gonna be
The wind underneath your wings
I'm gonna be the water underneath your bridge
I'm gonna be the bullet in your Glock
If you know what I mean
That means that I just got you, no matter what

Still floating through the city like my uncle's ghost
Give him a glimpse of who they love the most
I'm blunted, whoever they wanted, I ain't running over nothing
The blood that my heart is pumping is one below
We play this game, no one has repercussions
Took some losses, see where I faltered
And learned some lessons from it
My momma say I must be blessed or something
The same gift that got me paper, I be stressing from it
Remember jumping in cribs, thinking what drawn in rims
It wasn't all BT but this is just how I live
See, Imma take all of mines, if they got nothing to give
'Cause lack of inspiration had me chasing broken ideas
See, I was aggravated, blind pacing my mind unaware
That being lost would be the place I would find my ideas
I was a shoe fit, lucrative, new little nigga
I been through the blues groove
What couldn't you do to a nigga?
From what we had, this looks beautiful, nigga
If we had the end of day, I'd ask Krit to save room for a nigga
My life story gotta be worth somebody's time
This much weed, I need to breathe
Keeping my lungs on the line
Don't kill the vibe, I just begun to unwind
If they won't let me free my mind, then fuck it
I be comfortable dying
This hustle, only thing I knew from the start
All alone, singing this song in my heart

I feel so lost, yeah
I feel so lost (I feel so lost)
We are so far (we are so far)
We got so far to go
I feel so lost
I feel so lost
I feel so lost
We got so far to go
We are so far
We are so far
We got so far (I feel so lost)

And I wear my heart on my sleeves
It's been a while since I felt like I was part of a team
I feel like so apart, just trying to stay a part of this league
He weather heavy pressure, y'all fall apart at the seams from
I see why my grandfather drinking, that Seagram's
'Cause life ain't easy, remember momma had to scream it
And caught two busters to take her son
To get the teachers, then hopped on another to graduate
There's some seeing some
House, still working job, fortunate we eating
So telling me I can't? Fuck him, I can't believe it
'Cause I never thought a million years
Would bring us to this region
Lost a couple, want to rob but my focus still on the leading
Never caught me finding me, what distances me from the team, shit
And no matter what we've grow through, I love you dudes
I mean it
Smoking on that green, cause the path ain't always scenic
Learn from where I lack at, cause nobody's a genius
It's just some shit you gotta say, I'll break your heart in pieces
Trying to bottle it, call my own path, I don't follow shit
So far to go and feeling out of it
If this what comes from being lost, then I'm proud of it

Oh, oh

Don & Dewey,"Woo, the joint was a jumpin' on the corner
Down on a honky tonk street
When all of a sudden up drove a Cadillac
And out stepped a cat named Pete

Diamonds on a every finger
Wore the tailor made suit
He smoked a black cigar
He wore a stetson hat, he wore a pair of cowboy boots

He busted on through the doorway
Bad as a he can be
Pulled out his pistol, he turned around
He said, 'my name is a big boy Pete'

The music stopped, there wasn't a sound
Over in a corner stood a bad man Brown
Brown smiled and grinned, he said
My friend, come three steps farther and I'll a do you in

Now, Pete, said, a look a here, buddy
Before I tan your hide
I got a forty five that keeps me alive
And seven bullets on my side

Brown pulled a knife, he jumped on Pete
They fought from the counter, right a, out to the street
They swung from north, they swung from south
Brown, cut that black cigar right outta Pete's mouth

Brown slipped around behind boy Pete
Cut him from his head, right on down to his feet
Pete hit the ground, he yelled and screamed
Pete took his stetson hat an beat the scene

Now, if you ever down on the corner
Down on a honky tonk street
Don't mess with Brown, he'll cut you down
Take a lesson from a big boy Pete, wow

Don Baaska,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.
My mama told me, ""You better shop around.""

Ooh yeah, a-try to get yourself a bargain son
Don't be sold on the very first one

I hate to see you feelin' sad and blue now""

My mama told me, ""You better shop around (Shop, shop)
Don't let the first one get you
Oh no 'cause I don't want to see her with you

Uh huh before you let her take your hand my son
Understand my son, be a man my son I know you can my son I love you""",Shop Around
Don Byas,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Don Byas,"Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side
When you're gone, my sugar candy
I get so lonesome, I get blue

But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone
What can I do?",Fine and Dandy
Don Byas,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile

Don Byas,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Don Byas,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember You
Don Byas,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
