Mott the Hoople,"Old man Tyler had a crash in his car down on the fortune highway
Doctor said it was his cruel sick heart didn't go to church on Sunday
Oh your pace is going to knock you dead
Out of the race you got time to spare
Jerkin' Crocus is the cause of the cross you bear
Didn't you wish you were there
I know what she want
Just a lick of your ice cream cone
I know what you say
Pappas in bed well hey hey hey

When he got stuck with a hole in his head she asked to try it my way
Get down low with all that haughty jive you don't know what it's like babe
Oh oh oh it's getting down around here
I got nothing to hide I'm to tired to fear
Jerkin' Crocus didn't kill me but she sure came near
She's a nads puller
I know what she want
A judo hold on a black mans balls
I know what you think
Ease over baby going to rock that thing
Alright!
I know what she want
Just a lick of your ice cream cone
I know what you say
Pappas in bed well hey hey hey
I know what she want
A judo hold on a black mans bones
I know what you think
Ease over baby going to rock that thing
Alright!
C'mon Jerkin'
C'mon Jerkin'
I know
No no no no
Alright!
I know
That's better
No no no no
That's much better ",Jerkin' Crocus
Mott the Hoople,"Forgot my six-string razor hit the sky
Half way to Memphis 'fore I realized
Well I rang the information my axe was cold
They said she rides the train to oreoles

Now it's a mighty long way down the dusty trail
And the sun burns hot on the cold steel rails
'n I look like a bum 'n I crawl like a snail
All the way from Memphis

Well I got to oreoles y'know it took a month
And there was my guitar, electric junk
Some spade said rock 'n' rollers, you're all the same
Man that's your instrument, I felt so ashamed

Now it's a mighty long way down rock 'n' roll
Through the Bradford cities and the oreoles
'n you look like a star but you're still on the dole
All the way from Memphis

Yeah it's a mighty long way down rock 'n' roll
From the Liverpool docks to the Hollywood bowl
'n you climb up the mountains 'n you fall down the holes
All the way from Memphis

Yeah it's a mighty long way down rock 'n' roll
As your name gets hot so your heart grows cold
'n you gotta stay young man, you can never be old
All the way from Memphis

Yeah it's a mighty long way down rock 'n' roll
Through the Bradford cities and the oreoles
'n you look like a star but you're really out on parole
All the way from Memphis",All the Way from Memphis
Mott the Hoople,"Long, long time ago
Oh, I can still remember
How the music used to make me smile

And we knew if we got a chance
That we could make the people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

Cause February made us shiver
With every paper we delivered
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't face one more step

Oh, I can't remember if I cried
When I heard about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died or did it",American Pie [Excerpt]
Mott the Hoople,"Baby took me out last night
Got a little cadillac bite.
Shook me about - inside out
Didn't get home 'till light.
She's a grower, a goer - you gotta get to know her
No chooser, a cruiser - you turn around she'll lose you
Burned out as the light turned green
Smoke-screened off her rail.
He didn't see me comin' but he shoulda saw me runnin'
Faster than the U.S. mail.
She's a speeder, a leader
You're really gotta meet her
You see her, she thrills you, you look at her she'll kill you.
Listen, fella, baby don't you sell her
Don't you try and steal her away
Hush, man logs in her dam
Think you better fade away
Detonator, jail-baiter - a radar radiator
She'll annoy ya, destroy ya - she'll bring ya down in fire
Create her, mistreat her - no use tryin' to beat her
Admit it, she's greater, shame you weren't born later.",Born Late '58

Mott the Hoople,"No puppet, no liar, won't bend my lips to wire, No
Don't pressurize me so
Don't gamble, with my life, or you won't live to do it twice
Oh take some good advice from me
And let the wires rock

All dressed in black so nobody sees you
Smile in the wings, tell me I please you
Call me a king and watch for the wordworm to choke me
And you're like a giraffe, the performance is poor
Watch the audience laugh as my head hits the floor
When I'm broken in half you still reach for the floor
Stop!

I've had enough of this
The pantomime's reversed
I need, you feed
I greed, you bleed
Marionette, I ain't one yet
Teacher's pet, Well you'd better forget it
Marionette, I ain't one yet
Teacher's pet, Go check your stocks and shares
And when the coffin comes make sure there's room for two
You lied, I led
I died, You're dead
Marionette, I ain't one yet
Teacher's pet, You'd better forget it
Marionette, I ain't one yet
Teacher's pet, go check your product
A traitor, deceiver, a groovy disbeliever I thought
A puppet was a thing cheap-taught, No way
Creator, conceiver, romantic love receiver, caught
""Who are you""
""The nerve""
""I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I
Wanna get out,
Ah!

Oh he wanna play chords to the chick on the street
He wanna play words to a world that don't speak
He wanna play people who play hide 'n' seek when they don't talk
He wanna play a riff to the man with the wires
He wanna play lead but his hand's getting tired
He just wanna play but don't know how to say, stop!

OK, the show's been fun
But my wood's begun to warp
They won,I'm done
New one, begun
Marionette, I did my best
Teacher's pet, It just couldn't last
Marionette, Get me out of this mess
Teacher's little pet, It happened so fast
Marionette, Now I need a rest
Teacher's pet, Where's my sanity gone, Mother?
Marionette, I did my best
Teacher's little pet, I'm just like all the others
They gambled, with my life
And now I've lost my will to fight
Oh God these wires are so tight,
I'm just a marionette.",Marionette
Mott the Hoople,"Momma's little jewel, just out of school
Fresh from the nuns that made you
Don't know why but I'm going to try
To re-in-celibate you

Momma's little jewel, you got the rules
But I'll be the one to educate you
Take what's mine, take a little time
And don't bite the hand that makes you

True when I hold you near, well I'm
Caught, even when I'm on the road
And I'm wearing my scorpio faces, when I
Come in the midnight sun

What you want I can't buy
So why don't you try it my way?
What you look for ain't in the book
I'm going to show you someday

Laugh in the evening, when I
Catch you with my watering gun now
Wearing my scorpio faces, when I
Come in the midnight sun

You won't rise, you won't shine
You won't even try boys
You've got brains, if you love changes
You'll have to play with my toys

Momma's little jewel is such a little fool
Thinks she can learn all the answers
She don't want to feel, she just want to steal
Don't want to take any chances

True when I hold you near, well I'm
Caught even when I'm on the road
And I'm wearing my scorpio faces, when I
Come in the midnight sun now

Laugh in the evening, when I
Catch you with my watering gun now
Wearing my scorpio faces, when I

Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

Mott the Hoople,"Oh if my wheel could take another turn
and if my life replaced itself again,
I wouldn't want a single thing to change.
Oh it's been good, though it's been strange.
And if my dreams were willing to come true,
oh I would not even try to force them through.
I'm sure there's things I've missed, that others preached.
The goals they reached, they weren't for me.
Rest in peace,
even though the worries seem to mount,
don't let them count.
Rest in peace.
Throw all those miles and paper smiles away.
You make willow pattern pictures through the rain.
And swallow when your heart begins to breathe,
just like the birds, do what they please.
'Cause you know, we ain't gonna be here all that long
and when I go I want to know I sung.
If there's a road ahead, I'll jump right in.
Just got to win, this is my hymn.
Rest in peace,
even though your worries seem to mount,
don't let them count.
Rest in peace.
Rest in peace.",Rest in Peace

Remember well memories we all hid
But you're much older now, although you still are young
I know you well, I'm like you

Why hang around with clothes of another name
Hair so dyed she lost too much inside
Ain't nothing left to hide in the game

Hey Rose, how do you laugh in your own show
Try to fight the fears that rise within
Rock 'n' roll slag, oh my, you're such a drag
Trying to find the corner to inject

Hey Rose, so silently she goes
Careful not to make up, see your maker

Mott the Hoople,"(ian hunter)

His feet lay heavy on the road that led to birmingham
Unseeing eyes, defeated cries, the mysteries of men.
Many hears, the helpless tears that leave the troubled brow
A man once tall, he fought them, but he is older now.

For in your youth, you think the truth will always win the game
Some men are kings, some men are rook, some men are pawns to blame
But if your skin is coloured black, well the dice are hidden in
The minds of fools who twist the rules, so you can never win

Birmingham, birmingham, underneath your face
There's nothing but a space - you're hollow.

Unlighted sky, begins to cry, the shabby coat is weak
And homes with windows dressed in warmth, and mouths that never speak
His mind is dead, his visions spread that pass before his feet
And thankfully he wears that dream that shields him from the street

Goodnight my friend, this is the end, you'll never cry again
You'll never have to smile away the bastards and the pain
Is it too late, or can you wait to take another turn
And walk together down that road that leads to birmingham

Birmingham, birmingham, underneath your face
There's nothing but a space - inside you.

Birmingham, birmingham, underneath your face
There's nothing but a space - you're hollow.

Mott the Hoople,"(ian hunter)

There goes happiness
Down that street
Pick me up, put me down again
Just when I was on my feet

I get stoned every day
My best friend he gone and went away
It's her debt
And I've got to face it alone

Been a long long time now
Been a long time high
Making up promises that went wrong
I'm in the sky

In a ..(? )..not a trace
I see her all over my place
It's her debt
I've got to face it alone

And endlessly my trouble mine
Won't let go leave the past behind
It's a drag, so it seems
I must live my life in dreams
I must laugh while the other man wins

Guess it's the season
Brings a man down
All my fingers are stuck on my toes
And my feet are off the ground
Yesterday the world went away
I can't seem to find the strength to pray
It's her debt
I've got to face it alone

And endlessly my trouble mine
Won't let go leave the past behind
It's a drag, so it seems
I must live my life in dreams
I must laugh while the other man wins

Guess it's the season
Brings a man down
All my fingers are stuck on my toes
And my feet are off the ground
Yesterday the world went away
I can't seem to find the strength to pray
It's her debt
I've got to face it alone
It's her debt
I've got to face it alone

That you've been hanging around
If I find out that it's true

Gonna put you in the ground

There's a kind of misty morning
As I'm looking out 'cross town
Thinking 'bout my friends
Remembering what they said
And making me feel like a real lowdown

Well I saw that smoke stack lightning
When you pushed me to the brink
You got me worried, you got me mean
And when I'm mean I drink

About a tall cat sleeping around
Well I dunno who he is but I'm telling you this
When I catch up with him I'm gonna mow him down

Just as much as you could take
And then your love turned bad and now I'm mad
Cause I made a big mistake
But if you think I'm gonna take it
Lying down like a dog

And I'm careful not to wake up, see your make up

Et j'entre au bistro pour boir’ du whisky à gogo
J'ai pas mal au foie, personn’ fait plus ça
J'ai un ulcère, c'est moins banal et plus cher

J'suis snob... J'suis snob
J'm'appelle Patrick, mais on dit Bob
Je fais du ch'val tous les matins
Car j'ador' l'odeur du crottin
Je ne fréquente que des baronnes
Aux noms comme des trombones
J'suis snob... Excessivement  snob
Et quand j'parle d'amour
C'est tout nu dans la cour

On se réunit avec les amis
Tous les vendredis, pour faire du snobisme-party
Il y a du coca, on déteste ça
Et du camembert qu'on mange à la petite cuillère
Mon appartement est vraiment charmant
J'me chauffe au diamant, on n'peut rien rêver d'plus fumant
J'avais la télé, mais ça m'ennuyait
Je l'ai r'tournée... l’autre côté c'est passionnant

J'suis snob... J'suis snob
J’ai une foudroyante garde-robe
J'ai des accidents en Jaguar
Je passe le mois d'août au plumard

Que l'on est snob ou pas
J'suis snob... Encore plus snob que tout à l’heure

Oh the dancing and the singing
Oh the music when they played
Oh the fires that they started
Oh the girls with no regret

Often lost it along the way
Fought each other to possess it
Often died in sight of day

Mountain Con,"Last night an old friend came knocking on my door
I let him in, let him sleep on my floor
He spoke to me in a voice I'd known long before
Baking soda and tin foil to purify his score
Sing the song now

Yeah-ha
Yeah
Yeah-ha
Yeah

Last night death came swinging down from the moon
Drinking Argentine wine with a black attitude
Saying reality is the baggage, the airport is truth
He asked for one cigarette, you gave him two

And I try so hard just to get to you
But I'm surrounded by midnight singing these two white boy blues

I said you must leave take your mirror and your straw
If you're too tired to walk, baby, you can always crawl
In your desperate moments, in your bathroom stall
Take your Andy Warhol, it's getting close to dawn

Yeah-ha
Yeah
Yeah-ha
Yeah

Youth lost me running through the fields
She caught me off guard, baby, she caught me by the heels
A child of nature does not know how to feel
We know what she bought but, baby, what did she steal?

And I try so hard just to get to you
But I'm surrounded by midnight singing these two white boy blues

I drove into Cassie 
With all my might 
In a van bound for Dakota at Christmas time
I knew her in Havre, everything was fine
By the time we hit Glasgow, baby we were in a fight

Yeah-ha
Yeah
Yeah-ha
Yeah 

Yesterday was Tuesday, Diana knows it so well
From the trailer park to the ghetto to the wishing well
We pray for our lady welfare, deliver us from Hell
Jerk off the movie usher, sound the fire bell

And I try so hard just to get to you
But I'm surrounded by midnight singing these white boy blues

Last night an old friend came knocking on my door
He was dressed in ribbons from the Persian Gulf war
He spoke to me in a voice I've known long before
I said the man you once knew don't live here anymore
I said the man you once knew don't live here anymore
I said the man you once knew don't live here anymore

Moving Hearts,"They dropped the bomb in '45 to end the world war,
No-one had ever seen such a terrible sight before,
The world looked on with eyes wide to see where it might lead,
The politics of power, they passed around to see,
It was a time to remember, we never can forget,
They were playin' Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Russian Roulette.
They arose like the saviours of our modern human race,
With radiation haloes, that hung about their face,
With the key to the sure-cure, the treatment of our ills,
A hot-shot of cobalt, and a pocket-full of pills,
Speaking always of the enemy, who lurked across the sea,
While they crept in among us like a carrier disease.
Deep down inside the bunkers of the concrete and the lead,
Einstein's disciples working steadily ahead,
Making heavy metal power-plants to fire the city lights,
All you can hear in the underground is the humming through the night,
And the walls of tight security, circle all around,
Where they spill out their poison and bury it in the ground.
Holed up in the harbours hidden secretly away,
War-heads and submarines await to make their play,
The military masterminds improve on their design,
The soldiers get all doped up and stumble through the lines,
While the spills into the rivers get carried out by the tide,
They call this security but we're not satisfied.
Our statesmen and leaders and politicians pay,
Quick to heed the hand that feeds, they're careful what they say,
They call out experts to assure us, to wave their magic wands,
This is the power of the future, And the future marches on,
And they call in their favours, all their political gains,
While the spills fill the rivers and settle in the plains.
They've caused the death of millions, that's their stock and trade,
They will be afflicted by the fallout that they've made,
They've sealed their own inevitable doom, it must surely come,
Not even the moons of Jupiter will be far enough away to run,
When this earth that they've assaulted, begins to turn around,
And the unavoidable gravity, sucks them to the ground.
I know the minds behind them, they are riddled full of holes,
Not to be trusted with their hands at the controls,
Their eyesight it is twisted by the glory of their careers,
The heaped praise and flattery is music to their ears,
To listen to them talk about how it hasn't happened,
Yet's like playing Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Russian Roulette.",Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian Roulette

Jacko said that he'd fix him up with a girl who'd be alright
Well, he picked him up in his Sandman, they raced every red light in town
Jacko put on a real cool face but he's sweatin', there's no cops around

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

He's got a matchbox of pot hidden in a secret spot
Which they'll smoke in the old schoolyard
Well, he's never too sure if he gets stoned or not
But tonight he's gonna try awful hard

And he's fifteen or sixteen, he's tryin' to make the mean team
And Jacko's his man all the way
He'll go for broke if he can, he knows that Jacko's his man
And they both pray that they'll get away

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose
So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

Well, every guy's a clumsy poet and every girl's a beauty queen
Well, they're fogging up the windows of their friends parked cars
On the way to their land of dreams, you know what I mean

Well, he remembers the nights when the stars they burned bright
And she let him go all the way
Said it was different that time 'cause she said take your time
Slow down let me show you the way

Well, the sand was warm underneath where they lay
A cool breeze made the waves dance and play
A band played in the hall, they were loud it was small
But who listened anyway

And every guy's a clumsy poet and every girl's a beauty queen
But they're so caught up in appearances
That they don't really know what they mean

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose
So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

Won't you stand by the flag? Was the question unasked
Won't you join in and fight with the allies?
What could we say we're only twenty five years old?
With twenty five sweet summers, and hot fires in the cold
This kind of life makes that violence unthinkable
We'd like to play hockey, have kids and grow old

Fighters for Texaco, fighters for power
Fighters for longer turns in the shower
Don't tell me I can't fight 'cause I'll punch out your lights
And history seems to agree that I would fight you for me
That us would fight them for we

Now some of you might be wondering how I came to be living in Canada
after being royalty in Spain. Should I tell them, guys?

(everyone yelling but Dave)
Tell us, King!

(Dave)
You see late one night when the palace was asleep
Out of my royal chambers and into the garden I creep
And I wait till the appointed time, when the moon is lighting the pitch
At which point my peasant friend, who looks just like me
Arrives and we make switch!

World made up of silver and copper
Under my own volition, I took a change of position

Remember, slower pizza's more luscious

I've been flirtin' with Pierre Burton 'cause he's so smart in his books

I like to go out dancing,
My baby loves a bunch of authors
My heart's so broke and bleedin'
Baby's just sitting there 
doing some reading

So I started watching some TV, played my new cd player too,
She said: ""Turn it off or I'll call the cops and I'll throw the book at you.""
All this arguing made me get dizzy, called my doctor to come have a look
I said: ""Doctor hurry!"" He said:

So I got myself on a streetcar and it drove right into someone,
You know the driver said: 
""I was lookin' straight ahead!"" 
But he was reading the Toronto Sun 
""So?""

So my honey and me go to a counsellor to help figure out what we need
She said: ""We'll get your love growing, 
but before we get going, here's some books I'd like you to read.""

I like to go out dancing,
My baby loves a bunch of authors
Lately we've had some fricton
'Cause my baby's hooked on 
short works of fiction

So we split and went to a party, some friends my girl said she knew
But what a sight 'cause it's authors night and the place looks like a who's who

Now I'm pounding the ouzo 
with Mario Puzo
Who's a funny fella? 
W.P. Kinsella
Who brought the cat? 
Would Margeret Atwood?
Who needs a shave? 
He's Robertson Davies!

Ondaatje started a food fight, salmon mousse all over the scene
Spilled some dressing on Doris Lessing, these writer types are a scream!

Moxy Früvous,"When you've played out As the World Turns
You don't need soaps to clean your mind
Every little child learns
If you can't see dreams, your eyes are blind
Was it just a fool's impression?
Such an antiquated passion.
On the day they both conspired to ride the midway after dark
They had enough of their pride to not bring coins to this amusement park
And she held his hand to follow
And he held his breath, then let go
They crouched down low.
Sat in the front row.
Untied the rope so they could fly
Hold on tight, let's get it just right,
We'll take our last flight. You and I.

[the following paragraph appears in the
liner notes, but not in the song itself]
When you're getting tired of normal
You sometimes think you've lost your will
You see something less formal
And reconcile to try to move in for the thrill
Was it breaking down like most do?
Or searching for happiness where you're supposed to?

So they cried inside while their eyes smiled
There was no turning back for two
Erase the memory stockpile
All alone, and one thing left to do
In the roller coaster shadows,
They took off their shoes and bared their souls
They crouched down low.
Sat in the front row
Untied the rope so they could fly
Hold on tight, let's get it just right
We'll take our last flight. You and I.

Galileo, Netwon, Watt, they were genuises all.
Without them we'd be freezing in the dark at the mall.
James Joule found total energy remains the same
(Murray)
No matter what it's form.
(Mike)
That's why it carries his name.

(Jian)
A chemical, electrical, potential and heat,
Radiant, kinetic, ooh the list is incomplete.
They're always changing back and forth
It's really quite a blur
(Murray)
oh, how could he?
(Jian)
I've forgotten nuclear!

(All)
Ride a barrel down the falls
Then cook spaghetti with meatballs.
Really make your friends amazed.
Nuke it with some gamma rays.
Fly to Venus in a rocket.
Put your finger in a socket.
You may suffer from exhaust,
But none of that energy is ever really lost.

(Murray)
Then why can't we make a clean machine that moves perpetually?
Cause there's another law with which all energy must agree.
Whenever it changes form, it loses quality 

(Dave)
in other words...

(Murray)
Down/Damn that rising entropy!

It's entropy you see that turns finess into mess
A palace to a pig-stye why it's simply scandalous!
Energy once neat degenerates into waste heat (We must repeat.)

I once had a girl, she lived in the past
It was clear that relationship wouldn't last
It was clear from the way she had to sleep south
It was clear from the lines around her mouth
So I went for a walk in the ravine
I came upon an unbelievable scene
In a tiny creek there's a tiny boat
With a tiny man in a tiny coat
I said ""Hey man, do you think you can help?""
He said ""Of course I can - I'm an elf
We're not just fictional device
We sail ravines and give advice""
I said ""My baby is what it's about""

""That's the loveliest pot I've ever seen""
He said ""it's not a pot, it's a tureen
And what's inside will make you well
So ring this little dinner bell""
Then he giggled in french - that's what he did
Like a kid at Christmas, as he opened the lid
""Help yourself"" he beamed with pride

Sur tes dorures

Te tatouer sans mesure, sur mesure

Laisse-toi tomber dans mes bras
Glisse-moi sous tes draps
Dérivons jusqu’à l’outrance

Chantons pour les bienséants
Les délices de l’indécence",Tatoue Moi
Mozart Opera Rock,"On part sans savoir
Où meurent les souvenirs
Notre vie défile
En l’espace d’un soupir

Nos pleurs, nos peurs
Ne veulent plus rien dire
On s'accroche pourtant
Au fil de nos désirs
Qu'hier encore
On ne cessait de maudire

S'il faut mourir
Autant vivre à en crever
Tout retenir pour tout immoler
S'il faut mourir
Sur nos stèles je veux graver
Que nos rires ont berné
La mort et le temps

On tient, on étreint
La vie comme une maîtresse
On se fout de tout brûler pour une caresse
Elle s'offrira et n’aura pas d’autre choix

S'il faut mourir
Autant vivre à en crever
Tout retenir pour tout immoler
S'il faut mourir
Sur nos stèles je veux graver
Que nos rires ont berné
La mort et le temps

On se reverra
On se reverra
Là où rien n’est plus rien
On comprendra d’où l’on vient

S'il faut mourir
Autant vivre à en crever
Tout retenir pour tout immoler
S'il faut mourir
Sur nos stèles je veux graver
Que nos rires ont berné
La mort et le temps",Vivre Ă  en crever
Mozart Rottweiler,"I put a spell on you because you're mine
You better stop the things that you do

Mozayik,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
MoZella,"Speak to me, read my mind
Fill your mouth, with flesh and wine

And I'll be yours, just give me time
Give me time

'Cause you have everything I could ever want
You have everything I could ever want
You speak to my soul like you've known it before
And I just can't stop
Lord I can't stop, myself
I can't stop
Lord I can't stop, myself, now

I'm loosing sleep, over you
And I don't know what, I've got myself into
You just have something that I need
I can't put my finger on it
You can't put yours on me

MoZella,"It's almost like you had it planned 
Its like you smiled and shook my hand
And said hey
I'm about to screw you 
Over big time

What was I supposed to do
I was stuck in between you
And a hard place
We won't talk about the hard place

But I don't blame you anymore
That's too much pain to store
It left me half dead
Inside my head
And boy looking back I see 
I'm not the girl I used to be 
When I lost my mind
It saved my life.

Its how you wanted it to be
Its like you played a joke on me
And I lost a friend
In the end
And I think that I cried for days
But now it seems light years away
And I'm never going back
To who I was

'Cause I don't blame you anymore 
'Cause its too much pain to store 
'Cause it left me half dead 
Inside my head
And boy looking back I see 
I'm not the girl I used to be
When I lost my mind
It saved my life

I think I cried for days
But now that seems like light years away
And I'm never going back to who I was

I don't blame you anymore
That's too much pain to store
It left me half dead 
Inside my head
And boy looking back I see
I'm not the girl I used to be

That life seems like light years away.
Light years away.",Light Years Away
MoZella,"Amazing grace
Came in the form of a slap in the face.
Now I don't
Believe what I see anymore.
Cuz it's all the same.
We wander in and out of love
Like it's meant to scar us and
We never change.
No we never think to change

But don't tell me that I'm wrong.
You know I'm not that strong.
And I never thought that loving you
Would hurt for so long.
I worshiped you
And I praised your name and I 
Lived through you like a messiah.
While saving face
I let my pride control me
When you refused to hold me.
And I never placed blame.
And then one day
It just occurred to me that 
You talked and never heard me.
And I stood by you and never changed.
No we never think to change.

But don't tell me that I'm wrong.
You know I'm not that strong.
And I never thought that loving you would hurt for so long.
I worshiped you.
I praised your name.
I lived through you like a messiah.
And I bled for you.
And I screamed your name.  
And I worshiped you like a messiah.",Messiah
MoZella,"(Verse 1)
Sweet and low and to the point
You always get your way.
But I've long run out 
Of anecdotes and words
To fill the space.
If this is suppose to be something more
Then kindly explain what all
The pain is for cause

(Chorus)
You wanted it. You wanted it.
Don't lie to me.
Don't act like I wanted it more.
You wanted it. You wanted it.
Don't hide from me/cry to me (on second & last chorus).
It's time that we settle the score
Once and for all.

(Verse 2)
I picture myself up in your face.
Then I picture myself walking away.
But it never seems to go that way.
That's so much easier than what
I've got to say.
And if this is supposed to be something more
Then kindly explain what all the pain is for cause

(chorus)

(Bridge)
All you wanted was to wear me out
Test my strength
And prove my doubts
But that's not what love's about.

(Chorus)",You Wanted It
MoZella,"I pretend that I don't care
When you know that I do
'Cause every step that I retrace
Always leads me back to you

So how can you say
That you want me to stay
As I board the plane

Show me if you want it
If you feel it cause I know
That I'm somewhere in your soul

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason not to go
Home

And this is something you don't know
Truth is, I don't know myself
But all I know is when I'm with you
I don't want nobody else

So how can you say
That you want me to stay
As I board the plane

Then show me if you want it
And you feel it cause I know
That I'm somewhere in your soul

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason not to go
And this might sound crazy
But I've loved you all along
So just humor my senses
As I sing this song
To you

And show me if you want it
And you feel it cause I know
That I'm somewhere in your soul",Going Home
MoZella,"Wait while I see
If this is something I can do
If this is something I can be
'Cause I have never tried

To show you who I really am
Without telling you lies
And don't hestitate
Am standing on the edge of something
Am just too numb to know what it is

[Chorus]
If I can give it to you
You know I will
If I can give it to you
You know I will
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
And show you things that words can't do

Wait while I breathe
'Cause this is something that I still
Have not fully concieved
And you just don't know

The way this whole things turned on me
And I just can't let go
And don't make me wait
Your hanging on the edge of something
Am just too numb to know what it is.

[Chorus]

So there you go again
'Cause I see what you want
'Cause you want what you don't
In time things will work out right
So you say that I can wait
I can wait
I can wait.

If I can give it to you
You know I will
If I can give it to you
You know I will

I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you

If I can give it to you,
Then I will give it to you,
I just want to...
I will give it to you... to you...",I Will
MoZella,"Put your pocketbooks away
My soul can't be bought through the loss of one day
'Cause you know that you are the same
As me when we move from your ideology

The situation is out of control
Some reach for their Bibles I reach for my soul
Cause you bleed red and so do I
Who's to say that you're wrong or to say that I'm right

[Chorus]
And was I just killing time
Was I just filling space
Sitting on a land mine
Sipping drinks that were laced
I don't think that there's anything I can't do
But like a loaded gun in the hands of a child
Or a man on the run
Something's bound to happen

Ooh Lord and, all the days get so long I don't think I will make and
Ooh Lord and, all the days turned to darkness sadness can't shake it

Now I just can't stay quiet and you wonder why it don't pay to feed and not be fed

I was told to stand in line
By someone long ago that explained me my life
I'm a mold and I know it's a crime
That I followed the leader to dark and not light

And who was making these rules that we follow like sheep
And who's bending these rules just to format their needs
I'm faced with falsehood everyday
It's hard to tell who's real it's hard to tell who's fake

[Chorus: x2]",Killing Time
MoZella,"Sometimes I can't let go, 
Sometimes I move to slow, 
I swear It's not a show, 
I don't know if I'm tired or crazy, 
Or If my blood sugar is dangerously low. 

Sometimes I talk to loud, 
But you got to hear me out, 
You never need to doubt, 
I've never been so fragile, 
Now that's all I'm all about. 

(Say you wont) Stay away. 
(Say you will) Trust me. 

I didn't see it coming, 
I've been so used to running, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Forgive me if I'm crying, 
I'm tired of denying, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Never known before... 

So hard to say the things that want to, but I will, 
I feel so open wide that it's pathetic, 
It's silly to believe something are meant to be, 
But nothing will ever be if we don't let it. 

(Say you will) See me back that way. 
(Say you wont) Lose your faith. 

I didn't see it coming, 
I've been so used to running, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Forgive me if I'm crying, 
I'm tired of denying, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

I grew up on my own, 
Spent so much time alone, 
That it's taken me awhile, 
To let somebody in, 
Show them where I've been, 
And so whoa. 

You know I want you near me, 
My dreams are vivid and I, 
Can't see anything but you so clearly. 

(Say you will) Always be there. 
(Say you wont) Fade away. 

I didn't see it coming, 
I've been so used to running, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Forgive me if I'm crying, 
I'm tired of denying, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Someday were gonna be married, 
And I know were gonna be happy, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Forgive me if I'm crying, 
I'm tired of denying, 
Love is something that, 
I've never known before. 

Never known before...",Love Is Something
MoZella,"You keep crying on the phone
So why don't you come home?
So we can talk about the things
That I did wrong again
Somehow I'm always giving in

But I don't know what to say
To make you stay
And I don't know how to play
The games you play

But I can't cry anymore
So what's this for?
If you wanna leave, leave

'Cause everyone here knows that I
Would lay down here and die to make to smile
My timing's never right, it's no surprise
It's no surprise that I've been up all night

And I don't know how to play
The games you play

But I can't cry anymore
So what's this for?
If you wanna leave, leave

So hey, this ain't so bad
Look at all the fun we had
We fight too much
We're out of touch, you're free

And you know the way it goes
Though I had blamed it on me

Well, I don't know what to say
To make you stay
And I don't know how to play
The games you play

No, I don't know what to say
To make you stay
And I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what to say
To make you stay

And I don't know what to say
To make you stay
And I don't know how to play

Well, I can't cry anymore
So what's this for?
If you wanna leave, leave

Leave, go ahead, come on

And I don't know how to play

That I'm hooked on you
And by now
I'm outta my mind

I guess that I coulda found
Someone else

Every single word you say
Every time you're looking away
You got me beggin for more of you

Mmmmmmm
I'm beggin for more of you
You're a door I can't close
When I'm runnin late
When I see you I know 
That I'm tempting fate
I guess that I should move on
With my life
Cuz the state that I'm in 
Is just not right
And I never met anyone

You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will the spell be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

And I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow

Down, to my knees,

Mr. Big,"Can I explain it?

It's not not an easy thing to do

A cryptic fascination

Seems to get me through

A darkened stranger

Who left me full of doubt

She'd tell me that she loved me

Then the lights went out

Jane Doe, what was her name

Where did she go

Jane Doe, she slipped away again

Does anybody know?

Jane Doe

Platonic whisper

That makes me want to shout

Then she always disappears

Like a lady from a Barcly House

Who is this woman

Someone that I invent

I follow all night long

Like a bloodhound on a secret

Jane Doe, what was her name

Where did she go

Jane Doe, she slopped away without

a trace

I still don't know

Jane Doe

There's no fault, no blame

Love can twist the brain

This picture lost its frame

And John has lost his Jane

Jane Doe, what was her name

Where did she go

Jane Doe, slippped away again

Does anybody know?

Jane Doe

There's no fault, no blame

Love can twist the brain

This picture lost its frame

And John has lost his Jane

A boy I used to know
Shining eyes that see right through my window soul
Cowboys, kings and flying aces
Somehow saved the day
We were stealing kisses from the princess in the palace
My Alice through the looking glass
Is there really anything that lasts
Makes me wonder if time is a bullet
'Cause everything is happening too fast

I loved, I lost
Where are they now
The things I touched
And let them fall
Where are they now
All the people that I've known
That turned out to be me
Where are they now

Waiting in a line of five o'clock shadows
Another pencil in the drawer
Tripping over echoes in my head
Wishing I was someone else instead
Makes me wonder if time is my hero
And everything will come around again

I loved, I lost
Where are they now
The things I touched
And let them fall

I loved, I lost
Where are they now
The ones I touched
And let them fall

And let them fall

Where are they now

Funny how the time just slips away
An ordinary simple man 
Who's lost a little piece of something
Hold my breath and close my eyes
Say a little prayer
Here we go again hello
I didn't see the end and so the story goes
How can I be cool?
I always play the fool
I need a shot of love
Look an arrow through the heart
My mind is open to the page of yesterday
Isn't it a crime how love can go
I always knew there would come a day
When silence played the king of pain
So I close my eyes and hold my breath
And contemplate a change
Here we go again hello

It gets her by, but just for a while

How long, can she keep on chasing something wrong
Memories, of how she could've made it

The waves are crashing down she's caught in the undertow
Drowning in the sea
She's looking for a light but there's nowhere to go
Undertow

She sees the world through hazy blood-shot eyes
Just looking for another high
She lives by golden rules that don't apply
Life passed her by, and I tell you why
How long, can she keep on chasing something wrong
Memories, of how she could've made it

The waves are crashing down she's caught in the undertow
Drowning in the sea
She's looking for a light but there's nowhere to go
Undertow

How long, can she keep on chasing something wrong
Memories, of how she could've made it

The waves are crashing down she's caught in the undertow
Drowning in the sea
She's looking for a light but there's nowhere to go

The waves are crashing down she's caught in the undertow
Drowning in the sea
She's looking for a light but there's nowhere to go

(Chorus x 2)
Now what about us
Ooh they got us fucked up
They forgot about us
Ooh they got us fucked up

I went to jail cause they say that I be selling that yae
They hate to see a young black nigga trying to get paid
Get on the phone, call my mama and my lawyer
And tell all them hoes, I'm fuckin send me some money order
Cause I'm gonna be hear a while, ain't getting out
I should've never brought my black ass to the south,
I can't make bail cause I ain't got no bonds
They ain't gonna give me no bonds cause they know I'm gonna run
These white bitches will make nigga ass feel it
They got me fucked up, so now I gotta deal wit it
They want to make a deal, bitch I ain't no fuckin squealer
They say I'm a kingpin and a fire arm dealer
The kingpin is the white boy that locked me up
He got the whole fuckin neighborhood sowed up
Take twenty years for some shit you can't prove
Just because I'm black, you think that I'm a damn fool
No dope, no guns, no case, let's take this shit to trial
Mr. Bigg versus the state, and then I still might not win
Because I know they want to send me to the pen

(Chorus x 2)

I'm riding on the muthafuckin van
With two handcuffs on my muthafuckin hands
I'm on my way to court, trying to see what they going to give me
My homies in the court room holler if ya hear me
My bitches on the back row, crying and shit
This muthafuckin judge trying to offer me a ten split
I ain't taking shit, cause you ain't got no evidence
Tell the grand jury they can suck my muthafuckin
Riding on the muthafuckin bus
On my way to prison, but I don't give a fuck
They shaved my face, and cut the hair up off my head
And gave me a blanket and a sheet for a muthafuckin bunk bed
Three t-shirts and three pairs of socks
A bar stain soap, toothpaste, and a padlock
I'm settled in now it's time for me to creep
I finally meet some niggas, that I knew from when I was on the street
Mr. Bigg how much time you got?
I heard you had twenty years and you ain't never getting out
Telling me I need Jesus, muthafuckas get locked up
Now they want to be preachers,
I can't pray cause I don't know how
I wasn't saved on the streets
So who can fuckin save me now
But when I hit the streets again
I won't forget about my homies in the pen

(Chorus x 2)

Over by the softball field
Chumps telling lies about the niggas they done killed
And all of the keys that they flew from overseas
And all of the weed that they grew in Tennessee
Lying about there homes and they testerosed kits,
But those same hoes, haven't never sent you shit
I reminisce late at night laying in my bed
Thinking about the shit my mama once said
Never trust a nigga and never trust a woman
And never fuck a bitch unless you getting something from her
A lot of niggas bawl because they give them hoes their heart
The same niggas I see crying in the dark
You gave that bitch your house
You gave that bitch your home
Now you in the pen and now that bitch gone
Spending up your money while you stuck behind a wall
Stankin ass bitch won't accept your phone call

(Chorus x 2)",What About Us
Mr. Billy,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Good-Bye
Mr. Bungle,"A carnival for the human race 
Cotton candy, happy face 
A child talking with his mouth full 
Girlfriend gets stuffed animal 

A festive mood is all around 
Another world is what we've found 
Step right up, let's make a deal 
Let's ride on the ferris wheel 

You know there's something lurking underneath the shape 
With a mask over it's head and makeup on his face 
Into the house of mirrors goes a clown and his elf 
Take a look in the mirror and see the clown in yourself 

If you want to know what's behind the show 
You ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell 
Love and blood begin to meld, you've lost the self that you once held 
Merry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive, or dead. 

The clown that painted a smile on you 
Is now the one unmasking you 
Animated scenes unwind 
Dormant figures come to life 

Entangled in your own web 
A twisted tunnel overhead 
A glimpse of light, a drop of dew 
You slide into the swimming pool 
A roller coaster ride into the rivers of your mind 
The currents merge, your feelings surge, your life's a pantomime 
Beauty is the spiral going round & round the beast 
Without the vampire effect the carnival is deceased

We can't seem to find the air

Poor respiration is sure
To keep clear communication obscure

As if you are listening out there

The less I can understand
Pound on it, pound it in
To my ears the greatest sin
Feel a bit like Beethoven
Paint my lungs so silently

The darkest color of your noise
A crowd will contradict its own audibility
Can't hear the dialogue for the voice

No one is listening
Ears are ringing
Yet ears are ringing

In the morning I will see
What you were trying to say to me
As I respond into the sink
Need not again hear myself think
Ears are ringing


Wax within my ears has grown
Just like the snot inside my nose
My interpretation of distorted conversation

I will kill for isolation
To enjoy the breath of silence
When the blood comes naturally
Sacrifice the energy

Mole out from society

In the black iron prison of St. Augustine's light
He's paying the bills and they're doing him proud
They can float their burnt offerings on assembler clouds

The new Franklins fly their kites
With omega point in the sight
And the post modern empire is ended tonight

From history
The flood of counterfeits released
The black cloud
Reductionism and the beast
Automatons gather all the pieces
So the world may be increased
In simulation jubilation

For the deceased...
Spray-on clothes and diamond jaws
Wrinkles smoothed by nanoclaws

With my machines I can dispatch you
From this world without a trace
Our nostalgia ghosts are ready to take your place

Content-shifting shopping malls
Gasoline trees and walk-through walls

None of them knew...

As I watch the dead rise up out of the earth
I feel the gray goo boiling my blood

Try to hide from the lies as they all come true
Deus absconditus
Deus nullus deus nisi deus

I feel the grey goo boiling my blood
As the fenris wolf slowly bites through his chain
Try to hide the myth as it becomes a man

None of them knew they were robots

Buying an X or an O
Cats game for Joe Blow
In state craft tic tac toe

A binary hug or kiss
Post industrial bliss
Can be wrung from utility mist

They stole the great arcanum
The secret fire
Moloch found his gold
For the new empire
Once again
The necrophage becomes saint

Lindy hop around the truth
Jump back wolf pack attack
Swingin' up there in the noose
Jump back wolf pack attack
Slap back white shark attack
Slap back white shark attack
Phased array diffraction nets

From full-wall paint-on TV sets
Migratory home sublets
And time shared diamond fiber sets

Recombinant logos keys

Bitic Qabalistic trees
I feel the grey goo boiling my blood
As leviathan and his bugs freeze the sea

Try to save the world by immolating myself
The flood of counterfeits released
From history

The resurrection of the deceased

Confessing my feelings

Chorus x1

You're looks

Verse 3

You're Beautiful eyes
Got me hypnotize one
Look and I knew you were mine
One of a kind
With you're sexy lips
Got me in a twist now
Listen to this I'm trying to
Confess a feeling
Baby girl you know
My meaning I'm giving
To you
Is what I do when you
Look so gleaming
Like a rose stand out from
A flower like the sun
When you so shine
You're the sea to my life
And you so fine
Damn words can't describe
You're classy
From a star like a straight
Viloin from my heart that
Right baby

Tell you like it is

Tell it like it is
I ain't no kid baby I'm for real
And that's the deal
You're so seductive constructive
With the choices you make
All so great
If this world were
Mine ill have you by my side
These arm's of mine
Bottom line girl is
Lets go ride

",Confessing a Feeling
Mr. Capone-E,"Thank you lord for the cloud you made for me
I know you put the cloud there for all of us to see
That I have a home among stars to cure all my ills and
All of my scars... but I'm tired of living on a cloud alone.
I need a girl to help through my happy home.
I'm going to search and search this whole wide Milky Way
And I'm sure I'll find a girl someday.
To ride high on my cloud in the sky to live together
Until the day that we die but until that day I'll remain
Here on earth looking and searching for a girl that is worth.
To share my home and all that I own.

To love and guide me so I won't be alone.
The girl that I marry will live in my cloud and I'll do
My best my very best to make her proud.
Ohhh
That she married and carried for me,
Babies by the dozen maybe 1, 2, or 3 and on my wedding
Day I'll give to my wife, neck less full of stars for the rest of her life.
Thank you lord for answering my prayer for sending me
Down someone to share my love, my cloud who made me so
Proud. Thank you lord, thank you lord for answering my prayers.",My Cloud
Mr. Capone-E,"I can't move a mountain top
Everything's ordinary on my block

I don't drive a beautiful car
And I don't own an elegant home
'Cause I don't have thousands to spend
Or a seaside cottage for the weekend

I'm just an ordinary guy you left behind
Ordinary guy you left behind

Exclusive nightclubs are out of style with me
'Cause I don't associate with high society
I don't hang around playboy millionaires

I'm just an ordinary guy you left behind
Ordinary guy you left behind

Subways take me downtown
My apartment is my home
I spend the weekends with friends
Otherwise I'm alone

Walk hard
Pay me no mind
You're ashamed of me
You girl

Walk hard passing by
Don't you know that I'm not the guy
Moving non-stop
You can't see beyond my block

I'm never gonna let you go, girl
Never gonna let you go
Need love so badly

",Ordinary Guy
Mr. Capone-E,"(Chorus) 

Nothing like the summer time, baby 
Homies in the park go, crazy 
Cruisin' in the block with your, lady 
In the, in the, in the sunshine 
Kickin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertime Anthem, 
I know your feelin' that Summertime Anthem, 
So get down with the Summertime Anthem 
Summerti-iime, Summerti-iime, 
Summertime, yeaah 
I know your feelin it, yeah hey 


(1st verse/different person) 

It's summer time and I'm feelin' so good, 
Wake up in the mornin' with the player's groove, 
The weather's hot and I'm in my drop top 
Me and my friends rollin' through the parking lot, 
Today's a good day so call out the DJ, 
Bring the Gatorade, it's a sunny day 
Love the way I'm so fresh and so clean 
Out in the sunshine, you know what I mean? 

(i don't know this line it's on 50-51 sec.) 
So it's time to chill 
I'm home and I'm relaxin' with the meat on the grill 
And for real, (whistle) the girl's lookin so fine 
Dressed to impress and the weather's ain't denied 
All the time, the homies bring the cars out, 
Black, white, brown, asians no doubt 
It's a holiday, it's a sunny day 
Summertime Anthem sing along hey! 


(Chorus) 

kickin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertime Anthem, 
I know your feelin' that Summertime Anthem, 
So get down with the Summertime Anthem 
Summerti-iime, Summerti-iime, 
Summertime, yeaah 
I know your feelin it, yeah hey 


(2nd verse) 

It's still hot as I reach the mid-day, 
Water balloon fight, as the kids play 
Another day in the summer sunshine, 
Kites in the air as the food get's pre-pared! 
All the fella's looking for the pretty girls, 
(the pretty pretty girls out in the summer world), 
Like DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Fresh Prince, 
It's summer time again, let's reminice 
And how summer comes and goes and comes again, 
School's out, let's all have some fun again 
Everyone with the ringtones blowing up, 
It's the Summer Anthem song so you know what's up 
Play it loud, in the park, cruisin' in your ride, 
Everybody doing like these other kid times (?) 
Nevermind your problems, they go away 
It's summer time everyday is a good day 


(Chorus) 

kickin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertime Anthem, 
I know your feelin' that Summertime Anthem, 
So get down with the Summertime Anthem 
Summerti-iime, Summerti-iime, 
Summertime, yeaah 
I know your feelin it, yeah hey 


(3rd verse) 

Now it's 6 o' clock and it's feelin so good, 
Summer breeze straining throughout the neighborhood, 
Time to pack up the bags, 
And the roll on now, 
Tempting the giggles with the music playin' loud 
Toastin, like it was 94' 
Remembering the boulevard after the car show, 
Damit, those were the good old days, 
But the summertime's back and it's time to play 


(Chorus...again) 


Cruisin in the summertime, baby, 
Homies in the park goin', crazy, 
Crusin' in the block with your, lady, 
In the, in the, in the sunshine 
Workin' like the summertime, baby 
Girl's lookin hot playa, face me 
I'm so fresh from cleanin' so they praise me 
In the, in the, in the sunshine 

(x 2) 

Lookin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertine Anthem, 
I know your feelin that Summertime Anthem, 
So get down with the Summertime Anthem 
Summerti-iime, Summerti-iime, 
Summertime, yeaah 
I know your feelin it, yeah hey 


(4th verse) 

West-coast feelin' it, 
Summertime Anthem 
East-coast feelin' it, 
Summertime Anthem 
Mid-west feelin it, 
Summertime Anthem 
Down-South feelin it, 
Summertime Anthem 
Yeah, 
Summertime, it's the Summertime Anthem

You're my spiritual waking 
When I'm misty blue 
Somebody told me that this could last forever 
Put my faith in the heaven that brought us together 
Holding hands in the park after dark 
Gazing at the stars 
Never see us apart

If you're up in the club where the dub
It's like a bank sell to the highest bid
Put the cash in your bank
Girl I'm lovin' your booty, you can ""hoo"" to my blow
Then fish but please honey child, don't kiss
All I want is a freak when I'm up in the club
Maybe after the dance, dinner sharp, then the tub
I'm a nigga wit' class, you're a girl with a job
Taste of my neck like corn on the cob
I'm second to none, I'm freaky as ever
Go downtown, ""Well I never""

Ain't no stoppin' until your draws start floppin'
There won't be no beef unless the disc stop jockin' (what?)
She said this, and he said that
And he said that Timbaland can't rap
But I don't care because I make dope tracks
I make you bounce and wiggle, and do this and that

VA baby, believe dat

Aye yo, aye yo
Now I'm rich, I once was poor
If you're late with my dough, then there's no show

If you feel my butt, boy you gotta go
Out the back for touchin' my back
For trying to jack every Timbaland track
Maganoo, where you was?
They been bitin' our style, those silly bugs

Whoever thought this a happen?
Hey yo, that bum nigga rappin,' took it the top, now I won't stop
I remember bein' broke cause if I didn't nigga
I'd be frontin,' reminisicin' where your nigga at?
Ain't nuthin,' never thought about the hot outfits, jewelry or the celly
Back then we was in the skelly
Shorties with the barrettes, candy in the bag
The handgun, remember when we shot the fair one? 
A nigga like me had the motherfuckin' pro players and my Lees on 
For a nickel got my squeeze on 
Fly balls off the wall in the schoolyard  
Swear to gods got my first quickie in school garage

[Chorus]
I remember those days
You and I gettin' paid
Now we got it made, oh yeah
I remember, I remember

[Verse 2: Mr. Cheeks]
Aiyo, we open gates and let the dogs chase us home after school 
Until my nigga Skee got bit, yo, but that was cool
We took him to the crib we laughin', growin' up 
We drinkin' liquor on the stool while he throwin' up
We runnin' from school security, besides that the 102 cops 
Yo, the man was my grandpops
He used to air me out, he never tried to even motherfuckin' hear me out 
No punishment, but here we out
We back at it again, me and my men 
Yo what was realest when us niggas ?????
And all we want to know does anybody fuckin' care?
And why this trouble follow me every fuckin' where?

[Verse 3: Mr. Cheeks]
Aiyo, we used to hot wire cars, bragged about the scars we collected 
Tryin? to escape from them older guys up at the bars
They never let us bang, let's act ???????
We knew they had a crew, but yo our crew was thick
OK, now we graduated from junior high
We into badder bitches, caine, getting money yo, we livin? fly
We got the Jordan and ball, we got the weed and all
When Chris died yo we felt there was no need to fall
We seen it all, from welfare lines, all them good and bad times
Back then I wish I had rhymes
I got my childhood name from my wild hood
Sling still, as though it was a good thing

Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk

Walking around like you lost and from out of town
Who got you down, yo shit, you too hot to frown
I see you time to time whenever you creep through
You know my cousin D2, yea that's my people
I always ask about you, I guess I spoke you up
I swear if you was trees, I'd roll, light, and smoke you up (Yeah)
And I'm not kidding with you, for real a nigga dig ya
But can we hang out, spend some time, that's what I'm trying figure
Live alone, got a style all your own
Cinnamon complexion skin tone, I know you been grown
The mouth is statured with a work, for real it got me hurting
Of course a nigga flirting, come from behind that curtain
I got some more deliveries but yet I be back
And when I get back I want to see that (see that)
Matter-a fact gimme that number lemme hit you on the arm
By the time I get back you be gone (be gone)
Yeah, I got that number from her, 'cause after work she outtie
Headed back to the crib where she can live and get it clouty
At eight o'clock, we meet up at that after-work spot (Yeah)
If no one told ya today, yo that shirt is skirr-hot
You keep ya nails painted, always got ya hair done
Tonight's the night me and you go out and share one

Mama say, mama say, mama say, mama say..Eh

[Mr. Cheeks]
Yeah, hey yo,
We meet in front the jazz spot, she looking right as ever
Boosting master gloves, them gloves that master leather
Smile when she see me, I guess I'm looking comfy
She grabbed my hand and walked in front me, man I think she want me
Got a table for two in the rear
Cause over there, you's allowed to throw something in the air
Music sounding good, we hopped up out our chairs
I'm close up on them smells, we're burning L's and bears
We had a few drinks, we ate a meal and all
This night and her cousin, for real I feel it all
She got me wide open, I guess she wide too
Cause she done told me anytime I want to slide through
That I can slide through, I take you on that offer
I had to warn her, laughed and joked a bit, now I'm back up on her
Not tonight but give me some time, I'ma bag you
And make you my permanent Ragu

Mr. Cheeks,"Aiyo, my first thoughts was stop when my man left
I started drinkin' more thinkin' of my mans death
Then I thought he wouldn't want to see me crumble
When he handed me the ball I promised I won't fumble
And I won't, stood on the field implore the real
These player haters hate so much now they resolve to kill
Got your pictures it ain't the same without the laugh
I pour liquor in the grass think about the past

If there was no one I could speak with I could speak with you
You knew all I was into what I've been through
They couldn't fuck with us kid we was off da chain
Blew the spot up when we came and got inside the game
From street cats we brought it to the main stream
It was an honor playin' with you on the same team
Your namely a very great deal to me
It's only right I step it up you kept it real with me

And when that day comes
We're gonna be like every children
And when that day comes
Everyone is gonna enjoy themselves

Aiyo, I'm thinkin' yous about to come through at any minute
Bless your nigga on the track, put some flavor in it
Just a thought, I'm knowin' that you're not around
Can't forget how we did it in and out of town
Held it down, maintained, still inside the game
Listen ever since you left it hasn't been the same
Niggaz change, fam lookin' at me strange
Was goin' on with cheeks peeps hating different things

No doubt I'm hearing everything they say
He don't live around they way, why should I stay?
I play the hook but don't stay understand that
I bein' on the block ain't bringin' my man back
Those who know me know me straight love they show me
They can't hold me in the game aiyo wassup with Oby
Maintain in talkin' to my lost souls, see you when I get there
Meet you at the Crossroads

And when that day comes
Is when I get a chance to tell you I love you
And when that day comes
We gonna be yea yea yea yea

What went wrong all I know is that
My mans one that made my mens strong
On my own two I stand on right along I think
About how we were like the bomb
Right before we perform let me write a song
How you used to do, represents all you knew
Aiyo Taliek 21 gun salute for you
On top of losing you I lost you in the worst way
Now that's some shit them niggaz killed you on my birthday

Open presents nah said my nigga Tai dead
Celebrating birthdays with that shit in my head
Think about the time when we would chill
Up in 1 and 2 in back in Richmond Hill
Yeah that shit was real, us young niggaz growin' up
Whoever thought we would start bubbling and blowin' up
But we did, survived it all I wish you did
And I could speak for all the boys we miss you kid, yeah aiyo

And when that day comes
Everyone is gonna enjoy themselves
And when that day comes
And we gonna be yea yea yea

And on that day we'll need together
And we will be like
And on that day we'll need together
And we will be like

[Incomprehensible]
And on that day we'll need together, oh yeah

Mr. Cheeks,"Ay yo listen, I blow the spot hot, chicks I only get with
My nigga says, ?Got me shit, to help me spit with?
Me and my crew, man, we don't got the same dimes
Don't got the same style, don't got the same rhymes

Ay yo, this shit is major, blow my cell and pager
Say, ?I love but hate ya, love my cousin Hasha?
I'm in the strap game tight, I'm in the mix of things
Ay yo this spot here is only for the folks who came

Why were the niggas talkin'? You better keep on walkin'
You reppin' Queens nigga, I'm reppin' East New York
We keep the blunts sparkin' keep all the bitches talkin'
Stop all the yappin' nigga, before you in a coffin

Yo why you startin' Cheeks and then I stop to cough
On this track like a newborn orphan, I stay boss face
Up in the club flossin' with Dave Chanel
I just met him but I be tossin'

Yo before this niggas did it I had to Yankee fit it
With the black bandannas, yo this shit bananas
They think they doin' them, they really doin' me
They think they doin' are O L Q L E

They need to knock it off, I got the bank tight
Ay yo I'm back up in this game as if I'm Frank White
It's time to give it to these niggas, kid it's really time
No doubt you gettin' burned, you need to learn to rhyme

Fuck from a dummy nigga, it's nothin' funny nigga
We rockin' gold fronts way before cash money nigga
The wife beat if off, I keeps the heater warm
You thought G was gone and now you see it's on

I keep it really raw, that's how we give it to 'em
I'm holdin' down my G's we need to get to doin'
I got these kids growin', at least they right behind me
I live in 2 0 7, East New York you know where to find me

Ay yo let's get this money, let's stash some real estate
No doubt I feel the love, no doubt I feel the hate
It's no stopping us, some corny niggas hatin' us
Who pushin' us back to back, who skatin' us

On twenty inches now, with my tens down
I push a truck now, don't give a fuck now
I got my ho with me, she wanna roll with me
You wanna smoke with me? Well, bitch roll up with me

Yo, I keep it low key, the whole world know me
I put a lot of niggas on, niggas owe me
Niggas know how I get down, how I do
I know I bit off more than I could fuckin' chew

Ay yo I hit you nigga, never forget you nigga
Dynamic duo, you's a slim grim, I'm holy chulu
The greatest tag team ever, got our shit together
Yo I'm a field jacket, yo I'm a butter leather

That's how we make a hood Queens, Brooklyn
Once again shit is on, can we gone

Na-mean, [unverified] through situations in life yo know
Got ya ladies knahmean, some of them we hurt you knahmean

Ya knahmean, I want to dedicate this to my old lady ya knahmean
We going to do it

That's why I miss you much
Your laughs lips, your touch
All those things we shared
To show each other we cared

Candle light nights out
Let's get it on lights out
Wipe your eyes don't cry
This love we got it won't die

I promise this no lie
As long as we both try
To come close and make it work
I know deep down it hurt

All the tears and the pain
Never again I'll put you through it
But we can make it
Find it in your heart, in your heart

Kiss and make up
I know that will be hard
I love from the start
Now your hearts been scarred

I stand here alone, I feel like the dirt
You lost your main squeeze fuck her nice work
The whole town is laughing at me I'm a clown
I smile on the outside but inside I frown

All the tears and the pain
Never again I'll put you through it
But we can make it
Find it in your heart, in your heart

I apologize for all I have done
Caught between the walls I can't run
I sweared I wish I had you near
I sweared I wish I had you here

Yeah, you got me in my zone
Come back and make this house a home
If I could take it back I would
Excuse the way I act no good

Never meant to make you cry
Don't want to hear you say bye, bye

Let's give this love another try

All the tears and the pain
Never again I'll put you through it
But we can make it
Find it in your heart, in your heart

I know I promised babe
If you believe in me
I know at times I let you down

If it were me ask myself could I take it
In my heart as a man might not make it
Honestly sincerely truthfully I come to you
Despite all that I do yeah we can, yeah, yeah

All the tears and the pain
Never again I'll put you through it
But we can make it
Find it in your heart, in your heart

Yo
Just when I think that I've forgot you
I hear that thug that we used to rock to
Just When I think I'm gettin' on without you
Somebody Passed and asked me about you

Was in the back of the cab the other day
Swear to God I saw you walking passed the other way
My heart rushed, my face flushed
Tell the driver hit the breaks slow the pace up
Wait up, It wasn't you
Realized it's a mirage I was running to
Damn, can the affects of Love and time
Cause the mind to trick the eye?
I wonder how you gettin' by
And all the stars still in your eyes
But you still just get the five
You break the bank to spend the time
I reminisce of shifting time, to when you was mine

[Bilal]
Years ago, in a mist of hallways and sliding doors
Missing links of family very obscure
Vision of you shine
But only for a short time
My mistake I didn't pick up on it till years down the
Line

Here now as I (reminisce) reminisce, will I ever see
Your face again?
(In-fect-ion)
Baby as I lay back (reminisce) will I ever see your
Face again.

As I reminisce (fect-ion)
As I reminisce (In-fect-ion)

Hold still (uh)
The divine has placed us
In a small world (yes)
And thankfully so (Thank God)
Our paths cross once more
And to whose surprise but mine
Was 14th and 6th was the placed where we combine once
More
There at the front door of the cornor store you stood.

(reminisce)
I reminisce Infection
(In-fect-ion)
As I lay back (reminisce) will I ever see our face
Again

As I reminisce (In-fect-ion)
As I reminisce (In-fect-ion)

As it starts
But with few exceptions involved

Yes Sir
Yo I reminisce over this chick
Colder than a soda
Princess a soldier
Raised in Islamic culture
Sexy as the girl on the Jamaica poster
Men are over seas where there really don't be no
Sistas
Brought her on stage as Bilal sang ""Soul Sista""
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and Sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I pimp the dime
Put the pimpin' aside I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was devine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce why'all

Mr. Cheeks,"I thought I'd write this one for you, ain't seen you in a while
Staring at your picture wishing I was wit cha, miss ya smile
And when I'm wit cha it's like I don't want to leave again
Without you listen I don't want to breathe again
You give me a lot and everyday you giving more
So there's no need to tell you who or what I'm living for
I miss ya very much shit I miss ya every touch
And I know you'd come through for me in the clutch
I'm on the road with my peeps and I know I'm moving
But yet the time we spend together that's so soothing
Love it how we do shit I pour a drink for ya
You pour a drink for me and always think of me
I call you when you when I'm home I know you bored and all alone
I want to come and scope you up and place you in the zone
But we could be together on the right now
Cuddle on the couch, watch some TV, turn the lights down
That's what's up...

[Chorus:]
Cloudy was the day when sunshine came into my life, and made it brighter
(I can't go a day without my lover)
She's touching me with her warmness as the light shine from her smile
She makes me happy...
(I can't go a day without my lover)

I know I put you through some shit but yet you stayed with me
Messing with them other chicks it's only games they play with me
Searching for something I had with me all the time
I made a change, my love to you I'm giving all of mine
Send you cards in the mail to show you that I care
Shit a life without you is the only thing I fear
So I'm a make sure a nigga hold it down for
The foundation wishing I could be around more
But you know the drama gotta keep a nigga running
I bugged out with the crew it's only you I'm wanting
Call you on the horn to hear you on the other end
""Mental hugging giving my loving to no other men""
This one's personal so keep it close to you
Be there for each other that's what we supposed to do
And anything you want I make sure you get it
And anything you into babygirl you know I'm wit it
Holla when you ready for me...

[Chorus]
Yeah, listen don't mean to burn your ear out
But this is something you should hear out
Right now
Shit I'd give you the world
I'm a make it home to my babygirl someway or somehow
Ain't afraid to tell ya how your fella feel 'cause your fellas real
And on the real girl you're hella chill
I hope you get the message by the end of this
Wanted you from the start, from the heart I'm sending this
This my last gig I'm on my way home
And we can go and paint the town or we can stay home
It don't matter what we do as long as I'm wit you
Spend some time wit you, you know what I'm a do
Get it on wit you just like the first time
There's no need for this man to rehearse mine
Superstar wit ya, back-to-back and far wit ya
Without a doubt I'm going all out for wit ya

Ayo they gave me mad problems you won't amount to nothing
Well look at me now I did amount to something
The rap name in vain just like a four four
No matter were us niggaz rock we watch out for popo
Still up in the struggle I see nothing changes
These niggaz peep the way we roll so we holding bangers
Sport the jewelry cars and the shelto
Gamble for car money drink let the L blows
High school drop out got my G.E.D. though
Don't speak about what I got the d-low
Yo I know nothing but the hot shit creating
Up on the road trips and hot shit we scatting
From the slums stepping representing the jump off (jump off)
What we bump hard what you niggaz bump soft
Lived in Red Hook my pops name is Rudy Chattman
My good times always started with what's happening

(Chorus)
Just call me a hustle
Grinding pies writing rhyme 9 to 5
Pimping chicks doing sticks just getting rich takes muscle
Saga of a every day struggle
Bottom line dolla signs we ain't got a dime we gotta hustle
Clip feeling strip stealing sick villain
Let of a lot of wip pealing gangsta type scuffle
Payback could mean is time to layback and bubble
But other times payback is trouble
Just call me a hustle

Lets give it up for the rusty 32's
And the day before Lymer
For the cold old gold and the loks marijuana
When the G's stood firm
Perfecting their concerns
And a nickel spot with a single shot ready to burn
Now shame on me it was cloudy I was blind
I was thinking that this young coward nigga had a slime
Your not LB your not M.O.P
I brought tripping from my whole different angle to spot me
[Lil Fame]
I was blessed with a cursed
(Curse a blessing within this curse)
When curse became innershment encouragement
I'm immune to the pain now I'm loving it
I'm encourage to fakes the pain and
Everything else I consider is punishment
(Take it one day at a crime)
Sometimes I stare into the mirror
Asking my self we it all went wrong
Back on the grind bomb stash heat in my palm
Is a cold world my nigga so bundle and warm

(Chorus)

Ayo listen my daughter is getting older
I love to kiss'em hold'em
Daddys always gonna be there for you I told'em
The world is getting colder
But imma keep'em warm
y'all niggaz want to get it on I bring a deeper storm
Watch you niggaz like a job if I got to
Fuck scrapping you gonna feel when I spot you
I grew up in this raised around the hard times
Did the thing hustle in boulevard dimes
The red tops yellow tops and the blue ones
Powerful always came through with some new one
I peep them niggaz that was down but turn fuckiness
Ever since Tah pass

In a minute I'ma intervene on the internet
You want to enter the mind from closer, to intercom
And dot com for Complex styles
Plus how it mold ya skull
Ask Moulder and Skully from the X-Files
Those wild-asses broke into my crib, lookin for clues
Went through my rhyme books, I thought they were crooks
So I beat 'em like they stole somethin
I'm tired of shit - I told 'em for the umpteenth time
You can't battle me with my own rhyme
He said ""Yo ya rhymes just so phat!""
I said ""Ya don't know what phat is"" - He said ""No diggity""
He kept begging me, I tryed to figure how he,
know so much on this topic
Just then I noticed Ebonics 1 hanging out his pocket
I said ""What's that in your pocket?""
He said ""Getcha hands out my pocket""
His chin was slow so I socked it
He fell back and pulled out a gat, and pointed it at
And rata-tat-tat - And Skully screamed no
Just then I knew I had fractions of a second just to kick a flow
But yo, the shots missed
You can blame it on the rhyme invention...
Or divine intervention

I come across the forces that intervene
Left in suspension..

[Mr. Complex]
Red pillow, eyes heavy, droopin, they're closin, I'm comfy
I'm driftin, dozin, expand, Sandman, dreamland
I'm havin visions of improvisin on the mic
The audience is risin to huge heights
You should see how they screamin,
it's like I'm runnin 'em over with a truck
What the what? The record's causin a ruckus
I bust back with the word, the word provoked the herb
The herb provoked the verb, the dream broke when I hit the curb
Whoa, I can't distinguish my dreams from the real
I'm not even in bed, I'm sittin up behind the steering wheel
I gotta stop this goin two days without sleep
I'm takin in two lanes, then I hear two beeps
I keep on 'cause I'm only minutes from my crib - I struggle all my might,
but it's all over when I pull up to the red light
Last thing I recall was makin a left on the conduit to Rocker Way
Thought I could do it 'cause I was a block away
I gave it my best, never-the-less, I blacked out..
The scene I tried to act out 'cause I don't know how I got home
Was it the rhyme I was kickin off the dome?
Or was it I was just never alone?
Never alone.. never alone..

Clear. That's right, I hope u don't mind, if I take you on a trip like this.

I remember, like it was yesterday growin up everyday lookin for a place to play,
Riding bikes hopping on some pegs and handle bars
Going to the liquor store to steal a
Couple of candy bars,
Life was simple go to school get home
Make some trouble in the
Neighborhood all day long
I remember getting suspended always was a class clown
Always gettin into fights because I never backed down
I remember 6th grade when I
Smoked my first cigarette
Always around foos that smoked bud but didn't hit it yet
I Remember gettin drunk off my very first bud light
Damn what a saturday night
I remember Getting home late makin my mom mad
I remember growin up in a house with no dad
I Remember being told that family is all that we had
I remember those days still remember The past.

I remember all the homies, all the girls, all the parties, all the fights, that's right yea,
I remember all the fun, all the drama on a hot summer night that's right,
I remember we would cruse around, ready for some shhh to go down,
I remember like it was yesterday.

I remember getting a little bit older developed an attitude and got a chip on my shoulder,
You know that teenager that thought he knew it all was the same teenager in n out of
Juvenile hall, I remember being chased by the cops replaced my lunch money with a
Sack in my sock, I remember when the homie shy boy got his first regal ducking
In the backseat hiding from my p.o, I remember the homie Cesar scratching records with
A needle us two techniques a sack of yesca and some pisto, Me and the homie Ruben
Always used to stay at each others house, eleven years later, and we're still smoked out,
I remember me n the homies used to go to gang of parties get drunk without throwin
Up that would happen hardly, I remember back in the days there wasn't nothin on our
Mind except for havin a good time I remember those times.

I remember, all the homies, all the girls, all the parties, all the fights, that's right yea,
I remember, all the fun, all the drama on a hot summer night that's right,
I remember, we would cruse around, ready for some shhh to go down,
I remember, like it was yesterday.

And I remember when I bought my very first strap and still remember when I got my very
First tat my first jack my first blast my first sack when I started to first rap I still remember
My first track, and on the real I still miss those days close my eyes turn the page it was
Real in those days, fortunate I'm still free instead of still in the cage a gang of the homies
Still locked up cause they still live those ways, now I'm left here with nothin but a memory
Gangstas don't cry so I pour a glass of Hennessey, smoking a gang of marijuana like it
Was a remedy reminiscin reading letters all the homies said to me, It's meant for me to
Bring the world these very special memories homies from elementary stuck in
Penitentiaries it's left to me, to reflect on those days don't really wanna turn the page
I remember those days.

I remember, all the homies, all the girls, all the parties, all the fights, that's right yea,
I remember, all the fun, all the drama on a hot summer night that's right,
I remember, we would cruse around, ready for some shhh to go down,
I remember, like it was yesterday.

I sure do homie, like I said. I remember, as a matter of fact, how can I forget, you know
What I'm sayin. haha yea, 2007, we're gonna keep bringin these jams, that you can bump,

How can I get so far gone
When can I move on
Dreading a world that'll never go on
If I took the time replace
Only mine erased
'Cause I feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

(Mr. Doctor)
I heard a lil' tale about to children sittin on the kitchen floor
They eatin mayonaise out the jar and they moms out smokin dope on the stroll
Man, you believe this
Life is complete for them
And it ain't no emotions, only instinct
And that's how they'll be raised by the streets
A boy and a girl
Just up the boulevard from your world
Oh it ain't all gravy where you at
'Cause that's where he gon' go to jack
Catch his first case at, become a disgrace at
But not in this world up the boulevard
I'ma see to hit that liquor, starts so easily
The difference people in my life are dyin and I see this
My question is, to what lengths do we go so that they live
'Cause I'ma reach this
My locc's mean everythang to me, life is an odysea
But sometimes, you don't step up and take the reigns
Man, the world'll play you cheap, should I ride

(Hook)

(Slim Loc)
I'm picturin kids cryin, a head firin up dope over the stove
Family car gettin repot because they couldn't cover the note
Nobody knows what's to eat because there's no groceries
And the baby suffers from a rash 'cause he hasn't been changed in over a week
The oldest keeps things together, by scramblin up some powdered eggs
She's only 5, so why her mom can't keep them pimps from out her face
How could they rape in that arrestin
The mother won't admit, but she's molested, diseased and infested
With wing worms, both of her legs covered with ring burns
She cleans up, but whoever heard of some clean germs
I seen the, hurt in her mama's eyes, she tramatized
Been beat up, ever since her father died, no harmonize

(Hook)

(Mr. Doctor)
It's hard for me to talk about the good things in my life
With all the things I did for stripes
And the way I made my gramps and my mama cry
This life is real, and I ain't got time to care about you
Just sell smack to you, and sell crack to you, and sell a sack to you
Never give back to you, unless you know me and you owe me
And never worry about your dreams, that's you the bigga the lil' homie
Here to corrupt you for sho', like my pops did and he did it wrong
Now he lost everything he owned and he lost everyone he knows
Here to corrupt you fo' sho'
Like a ??? showin you the ropes
And introduce you to all kinds of good stuff like alcohol and weed smoke
And dice games, take you to places you may die
And the whole time we rollin, I'ma say, man, this the real way to survive
Understand this

Each day by day, each day by day

Take a look around your yard
And you ask yourself
What can't I leave behind
Their just things after all
You don't need things anymore
No, you don't need things anymore

It's funny how much junk
Into one trunk can fit
I knew this day would come
When I look at you and you look at me
Anyone can see

I'm learning to live without your love
Each day by day, each day by day
I'm learning to live without your love
Each day by day, each day by day

Where in the world will I go, I don't know
Anywhere but here
Where in the world will I go, I don't know
Anywhere but here

Where in the world will I go, I don't know
Anywhere but here
Where in the world will I go, I don't know
Anywhere but here

Where in the world will I go, I don't know
Anywhere but here
Where in the world will I go, I don't know

Mr. Hudson,"Oh, now I'm walking back to our place
Which is soon to be your place
Watching my feet, they're as stubborn as concrete
I'm knee deep in the jumble of our lives
Throwing shit into bin bags, I reach for the door
The dog's at my heel, thinks we're going for a walk

And I realise We never been as fucked as this
So grown up now we're squabbling like kids
Your mother's plates, dashed on the floor
I can't keep a stiff upper lip any more 
We never been as fucked as this

Out on the street and we're screaming like kids
The neighbours watch, well let them talk
I can't keep a stiff upper lip any more 

Leaving, throwing all of the black bags
In the back of the black cab
You see I'm not bluffing, no

I'm actually leaving, and now I'm sleeping
On the front step of my mate's place
Cos he stopped there, cos he's shit faced

And I realise We never been as fucked as this
So grown up but we're squabbling like kids
Your mother's plates, dashed on the floor
I can't keep a stiff upper lip any more

Out on the street and we're screaming like kids

Mr. Hudson,"Straight, no chaser.
We don't waste our time on fakeness.
One glass one shot is all it takes us.
Better this than fade away

So, our story goes this empty city
Crowded skies are clearing but I'm lonesome.
No! Bring on the night.
There's work a plenty.
Fluorescent lamps are passing in slow motion,

Only I will wander
Only I can leave

So we set the scene, a sea of faces.
Laser eyes are watching as we close in.
Don't play innocent. 
I know your thinking.
You're chasing conversation out of focus.",Straight No Chaser
Mr. Hudson,"[Chorus]
There will be tears
I've no doubt, there may be smiles but a few
And when the tears have run out, we'll be numb and blue

I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 
I can't be there with you but I can dream 

I still dream
I still dream

Oh no, I stubbed my toe
Crack comes the pain like a bullet
But at least it goes
Not like us
Happiness came and went; we had a little tear and now the tears are spent
We were trying to move forward love, but it's tricky through a brick wall love
What the fuck, are we doing love? 
How the hell do we move forward love?
Had you had a little drink?
Did you have a little think?
Did you have a little walk down the beach and have a think?
Ignorance was so much bliss thanks.
It was bliss but then came the kiss.
My boy drove me all the way home, he said
""Son, it's a situation.
Whatever you do,
There will be tears.""

And a good book by your bed

A little bit older?
Are we out of time?
I know that, should we ever break up
We'll find a way to make up
In the fullness of time

In the suburbs on the greener side of town?

From stretching out your lungs mega penetrate my guns
So I keep 'em concealed I'll leave you leakin for real
The mother fuckin devil kid grim reaper with steel
Yo the sickos on reserve load the clip up with my word
I spit til you're disturbed verbs ticklin your nerves
Cock back the hammer in the center with gore shot
Foully droppin newborns on top of their soft spots
Quick vagina soars rippin out your spinal chords
You got gashes on your boards but you're dead like dinosaurs
Hand cuff you to the bed the drama's seeming sickening
Leave you faggots dead just like Jeffery Dahmer's victims
Pissin in your mouth you got an obscene smile
Your teeth are shinin yellow like that retard from Green Mile
Slice your wrists with the box cutter like this
Another sly bitch with the butterfly stitch
Born to hate your par so you catch a gapin scar
A wide open wound you can't close with staplers
Or a needle and thread this beat is leaving you dead
I blow a shot through the top now I can see through your head

You're coughin your tonsils with my elephant shrapnel
Destined to stomp you stuff your face in the mud
Never waist no slugs that's why I pace with the jud
Guns will point at blank range I'm pointin pistols for brains
Put you splattered like paint your whole anatomy faints
Stuffed like Latter Day Saints that don't know how to be quaint
It's assault robbery or a battery rape
Peep the tragedy shake and the pin dropping silence
You shot with the 9 inch for stoppin the violence
Do you a slight favor before you're mortified
Cut you with the light saber and wound your quarter eyes
Ain't nowhere to hide from my gruesome legacy
It's hard to flea while you bleed cause you're losing energy
Foul like sexual harassin blast you with the mack 10
Violent homicide the intellectual assassin
Drill saws and tools fill the gore slaughter you
Drown you in a water pool now your breath bubbles rise
Trash troubles lies but see I'm the one who ends em
Deatha and disguise with the leatherface resemblance

Mr. Lif,"Life, a new state of mind, new state of being
Constantly striving to understand what you're seeing
Finding the courage to stop fleeing
Problems that lie within
So this is where we begin
Self-esteem: something that's diminishing
Look upon the faces of the youth you'll see them withering
Societal pressures can be imprisoning
Look at the effects that they have on us all is rather vividly
How many women you know with eating disorders?
How much makeup on the faces of our pre-pubescent daughters?
Dudes are acting macho and they don't know why
A famous never-written motto is that ""boys should never cry""
Keep all those emotions bottled up, now what's up?
You can't communicate once you became an adult
Situations got brought 'cause you had lockjaw
Your kids ended up learning about life from a pop star
But I feel that rap is more real
Matter of fact this music's gotten me through many an ordeal
I was laying on a stretcher kicking rhymes by Eazy-E
After falling off my bike while holding food from Mickey D's
So I chilled, had to calm my mental state
Happy with the knowledge that the music helped me meditate
And while I'm healing waiting for this world to erupt
You can catch me sitting next to my crate pulling out cuts

""Pull out your cut"" (Rakim...scratched)

Yeah that's what I'm talking about right there
But yo kid, yo I was buggin, you remember ""Watch Me Now"" by Ultramagnetic?
Oh of course dog, my favorite joint though was Gang Starr
What's that joint? How's that joint go?
Wait, yo I think I remember yo

I'll flip, you know I'll flip the script
I said I'll flip, you know I'll flip the script
The Guru, he's been my idol for years
Ripping shit with Premier, making the be	-boys cheer
And the GZA, Investigative Reports
He, Ghost' and Raekwon, they didn't take no shorts
Plus the are, 'cause that's the way that it has to be
These brothers redefined lyrical mastery
And I could go on cold pulling cuts for days
But I got something to say about you rappers today
Your rhymes drop in weak spurts so you bite 'til your teeth hurt
But I'm your dentist so meet my apprentice
Chucky, and Charlie Bronson from Death Wish
I couldn't hoard all of these medical skills and be selfish
It's hard to say rhymes with no incisors or canines
I kill all the weak minds, administer brain????????
'Cause I'm the type of kid that's on the positive tip
But that's because I suppress my urges to slaughter you quick
But this time I just can't fight the feeling
That's why I'm smiling as your small intestines dangle from the ceiling
You're over, as KRS has said on the track

Mr. Lif,"Daddy's got a new life now
A new daughter and a new male child
A new swagger wid some real style
New car new house brand new spouse
Little shitty dog named Pouts wid smile on his mouth
We'll be straight up we're forgotten cause developed a plan
Once the monkey takes some time to hang with his own fam
Hap' and gay to let ya know he still cares and such
Ya won't grow apart too much from bein' outta touch
But he wasn't there for him on the daily ghetto basis
In order to drop jewels I stay clear of the racists
Heavy promises became weightless
Sincerity became faintless
He's praying for a Santa A-list
Time is passin' by yet his scars remain ageless
He called him on the phone to say pop's
This'll take a minute of ya time
But his wishes were divined
By the disenchanted tone at the end of the line, hang up
He tried to look strong in front of mom back up
John stop lookin' forward to the day you gonna see him on
Dry ya eye to eye and you'll receive an embrace
From a lost heart that's pumpin' blood up to a guilty face
He's gonna try to find ways to make up for the last twenty nine days
Or was it thirty, I think he heard me
In situations like this ya speech becomes wordy
He's got a hundred million ways to tell me not to worry
But this time I wasn't hangin' on his every sentence
Ears crippled by the pain and negligence so was the tendency
He spoke I couldn't hear a word I zoned into black I observed
My only thoughts were missin' out on love that I deserved
Tryin' to convince myself I'm weak within the mental
The silence breaks because your father's guidance is essential
He's lookin' down with a smile sayin' that the future will be great
I don't see that dad, but what about the now?
Johnny come and leave ya dad alone now
Yeh it's just you and momma now
Stop the cryin' now, just try to smile now
Try to think of other things now
Momma's got another date now
You can get through all the anger and the hate now
Calm down and wipe ya face now
I know it seems to be hard
But I promise you we'll make it through somehow

Little girl their firstborn their sunshine
Never been a reader wrong get it right one time
Here's how it goes, she's off to school an' dancin' on her toes
At an hour long ballet class then on to the piano
Two hours of repetition, emulatin' class with music compositions
Do your homework with precision
By nine-o-clock she collapses in a heat of dizziness
But sleep so tomorrow you'll repeat ya business
She got straight A's a stroke of her stress
Throughout her maydays but drawn up out the melees
Her mom and dad tryna blame each other different ways she stop and gaze
Thinkin' how it drives her crazy when their voices raised
This the web that ruins most of her days
From her perfection was expected
An exec that workin' hard without receivin' any raise
At night she cries when she lays
Then she wakes up, washes up smiles and goes along like it's okay
On to high school, there's more intensity within her cycle
She's makin' all the guys drool
Here comes the extra tight rules
No late, not with college on the plate
Practice hard, study hard stay in focus keep ya head straight
Now she's a nervouse wreck, lookin' to collect
Anything that she can smoke swallow drink or inject
When she was mentally gone she went to the prom
Had dates and actually could sit down
Discuss relationships with her mom
But tell me how much pressure can a person take
Before they break and maybe crush this on a large enough escape
So one night she turned in but stayed up late
At her desk with a single piece of paper and a papermate
Here's mom a federal team waked at daybreak
What she saw made her knees shake the death of dear Kate
The note said here's the future of your fuckin' perfect child
Please be proud I'm livin' for the now
Do your work, clean your room now
Take the makeup off your face now
Eat your dinner now, get off the phone now
Leave the boys alone now
Saturday night, you stayin' home now
Go to your room and sit alone now
Katie with the needle how
Look baby momma needs you now
Breathe now, God why did this have to be now",The Now
Mr. Lif,"Vision is blurred yo

This is the last chapter
Bombs hit who? Crushed what?
Over there? Oh my god, oh dear
I was hmm.. I think I was *h* movin somewhere
About to paint my fear bright glare not quite clear
Stay blinded to the light of possibilities
Think I heard the screams of those in my proximity
On how they started thinking wishfully
Guided by fear I'm suddenly aware
Please, is anybody out there?

It was a gentle fission kiss on my block
And hot light like a baby breathing sigh a terrain
And now my name is merely left
Suckin on brain exist before the final flash
The emotion of pretty details of a life I had passed
Now my warm night in Brooklyn is ash
Falling from the snot of loosies that I choked
Around the corner from class
Before the moments when the moon can move fast
Another summer slowly growing with the friendships
That would end with a blast
Or how the hours could so blissfully lag
She slid her tongue between my lips and I gasped
Told my dawgs and they laughed
Now we're combining our cash at last
A pack of smokes and a flask
Hopeless liquor with a

Convert to atheism denounce god pronounce religion dead
Faith in nothing trace my wrists with razors
I refuse to wait for the blades to erase my spirit
Death - faced with it - run to it - not from it
Swallow all the pills in the medicine cabinet
Chase it with a bottle of 151 hung mommy
Head outside the smashed windows in trash my hotel lobby
Break the grip off the time at last
I find I get to him up Wish I did more sinnin
Get a strap on run up in two women
Laid in the middle of a highway wait for pain to hit me
Still a can with people lootin screamin come and get me
Finally it was porn shop biggest gun crowded street
Blow my brains to hell - I'm gone - and let the devil come for me

What's the chance that I'd be one of the last ones left of my preceders
The Earth Crusher came before I could even conceive a fetus
But I did go from nothing to misunderstood elitist
Who tried to tell his people the lies instead of acting like defeatists
But what good is that? Cause we're now all goin to hell
Like some kid playin in his class out talkin before the bell
I died believing in righteousness but I could have indulged more
Cause giving in to temptation don't seem that raw no more
I heard some airline offered flights into space
I shoulda took it to see earth before they matched up the place
I thought I'd be alone when they finally came to get me
But nobody gotta miss me because they all comin with me

Our horizon was accessorizing we bred more need
Best believe this be the equation of greed
I need a new car and thus new breaks
Another tune-up with lube
Whatever's put together shall be unscrewed
In times of famine we made more food
Food made more people
It's all explained within the cycle of evil
Would I trade it all?
Cruisin down the highway on a bright summer day
Gazing out a plane to see the earth from miles away
Watchin the patriots win the super bowl
Grabbin that fumble from Ricky Prole
Or my stereo provided me with rhythm and soul
I don't know, all I know is I feel guilt for
Every single thing I've ever bought and sold
I shoulda been at more demonstrations
Planted bombs in corporations
Murdered CEO's and cancelled TV shows
Burned billboards and torn posters
I coulda read more
Finally I get to meet this god they left us dead for
And its ill, its power to the form of a bill
To which people killed by manipulated free will
Conscience be the crucifix a chopping block for poppycock
And I can feel our spirits drop upon these streets I oddly walk
Enough talk! Here's my last chance to cherish a thought
My flesh is fully melted and my stomach's in a knot
So to my love I hated to leave you alone
Parted my zone passion took me to places and my life was a poem
Baby I was on my way home about to catch a flight
Our meeting has dissolved in radiation and light
Love you gave me made me shine
You're gorgeous with a powerful mind
You lifted my spirits and strengthened my spine
I'm at peace with my life cause knowin you was divine
You made me see eternal beauty in a world that was dying
Now we're all ground by the grind
Out of luck and out of line, out of signs
And now we're out of time...",Post Mortem

This is rock bottom why yall, I never expected it
In order to be businesslike you must meet the prerequisite
Leave your culture at home, smile, don't be too proud, too wild
You may suffer, just don't cry out loud
This notion of professionalism is like an exorcism
Forced to give your life away while you're earnin' a livin'
These thoughts had stopped me from rejoinin' the work force
But now the situation I'm in, just seems to hurt more
Maybe it won't be bad, maybe it'll be good
I could use a little structure in my life, maybe I should
Take my suit and tie out of the closet
Try shinin' my shoes and brush the fuckin' dust off of my wallet
Let's consider the prospects, make a couple phone calls
Now so many interviews you know I got next week
I'm strictly goin' from the bottom to the peak

[Mr. Lif]
I got a job at a business place I chose not to name
Ask me how did I achieve this so quick? Yes you may
Back when I was  compiled a stunning resume
I didn't value way back then, but boy it helped today
I'm pushin' every single thought of rebellin' away
I'm workin' real hard, and my pockets are swellin', and hey
Can you believe I met the girl of my dreams, I swear she's meant for me
We've been together over 2 years, goin' on 3
We married on our 4th anniversary
Bought a house and turned a room into a nursery
For the bouncin' baby that we're expecting in June
I sat in that delivery room from noon, to noon
24 hours of labour then the nurse asked me his title for the paper
You know, so the government can chase ya'
First name: John, Last name: Insignificant
I'm smiling like a proud dad; I got the birth certificate
Go to the house and here's my 
And I looked around and nothing's good enough for her or him
So my 8 hour days became 9; 9 slid up to 10; a subtle slip up to 11 and then
And after a 12 hour day, I too little energy to say 'I love you' to my baby
Or play daddy to J, and I thought this was the way 
O be a husband and a father
I guess I could've looked in her eyes, and seen I lost her
But it wasn't my fault, I'm workin' hard, it couldn't be
I've been successfully existing as a member of this family
I was so convinced the household had to always be complete
I didn't realize the only thing that's missing is me

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lif]
There was never any talk of divorce
I can't believe how focused I was in the face of such a huge potential loss
Thought I signed a grievance with the boss
In fact, I was mad at my wife, as if she's trying to knock me off course
But I still visited the florist, to get her flowers
(When the last time I did this?) Hmm, not since our wedding shower
I got home and I was greeted by the fact we'd been deleted
I was someone that my wife and child thought they no longer needed
And before I could say, 'Where's John?'
I looked down and he was clingin' to her arm
I realized-ed that I'm wrong
I blacked out and by the time I came to, they were gone
But somehow I sat and shook my head, and then I carried on
And I still completed 3 weeks of work, before my breakdown
The ambulances came and I got medicine to take now
And it's hard to get a job when you been treated and released
So both my relationship and my career had deceased
It took years to put myself together, piece by piece
And thank God I found a woman that's propitiate with me
And I'll never let this happen again, it's not to be
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

Burnin up my bridges, make your turn religious
Tell my nigga Easy to holla when he sees me

Thought about your homies, I think they let your down
That's insecurities fuckin wit maturity
Thought about a foe, sick then it occurred to me
He heard of me, he chose to be a starter
Fatal your mistake, never take me from my daughter
Use your imagination, premeditation
Execute you mother and your whole generation
Give you all the chills, make you pop pills
Piss up on your jeans, see me in your dreams
Prepared to be, scared of me, Satan can't compare to me

Walkin down the block, and we parked and we talked
Came over my house, she was bobbin on the cock
Isn't that a shame, I got a little fame
I'm all up in your girl and I don't even know her name

That's when I seen her, nasty cochina
Met her through her prima
Quick to approach, puffin on a roach
Blowin smoke, baby wants to choke
Broke lil ass, had a cash
Straight to the point, left lipstick on my joint
Started askin questions, What I've been up to?
Still makin the music that you ride and bump to
Professional hooker that strips for the chips
Pierced nipples and clit, likes to play wit the whips
Exotic, erotic, you want it you call it
But watch your play boy cause she's out for the wallet
Ready for the smackdown, pornos in the background
Hi-jack a pussy, slap her, known to be a nut cracker
And if you at there payin, she straight up playin
The role of a spouse but never at the house

But you won't see that Siccmade fightin in the club

The Latin Kings, ready to do big things
Like some big time West Coast rap machines
I'ma give you what I got and baby that's plenty
Gon, make it crack, baby back at the telly
Gonna make you wet, gon make you sweat
Just to see how nasty you can get
Chill on the set wit a glass of moet
And if you can't back up what you say
Then you ain't shit
Yeah, ain't no actin, play time's over
I'm drunk and bizzin and puffin on doja

[Chorus]",Let's Ride
Mr. Lil One,"Yeah, you know how we do
Lil Uno, and I brought my homie 
Sicc Made
We're gonna break down
To all the bitches
And all the hoes
Here we go

I got plenty of hoes
Freaky little 20 year olds
Centerfolds, callin' on the cellular phone
They pluck, hook it up and get freaky
It's all good girl, where you want to meet me
She said night life, and bring pornos
Bring your home boys, I got my home girls
Want to fuck all night and get nasty
Lil One can you please come and spank me
That's affirmative, ten four
Let me come and do you like a nickelbag whore
I love the way you moan every time that we bone
I love the dirty thoughts that you put ip in my dome
I love the way you wiggle every time I'm in the middle
I love the way you fuck when you're fuckin' wit the Little
I love the way you keep it on the lo lo
And never let a mothafucka know know

[Chorus: ]
I love the way you up on your lipstick
Baby can you suck on my big stick
I love the way you lick on your lips
I love the way you move when you strip [Repeat: 2X]

Well it's that lowridin'
Young thug Sicc Made
It's a trip man
So many hoes to get play
Mr. Lil put me up on the game
So it's mine time to shine 
For the fortune and fame
And trust me when I shine
Cause I'm always gonna glisten
Wreckin' mics in my pad
Spittin' out some playalistic
Bitches, I ain't givin' up no shorts and no losses
Collectin' my cheddar, organize like crime bosses
Your lose is my gain and I still maintain
Got to dykes in the back takin' two dicks to the brain
Sounds insane, my thought is that you dispise
Most of the time I'm too high to realize
How trifflin' this hoes be
Actin' like they knows me
Bitch don't know shit 
Except a smack from the n-you-t
So to say but that's the way it is
In that Diego, California, biatch

[Chorus]

I remember a day
Saturday, TJ
You were all up on a mothafuckin' Ese
Wigglin' your ass every time that I passed
Givin me some look, like some dick up in your ass
Dance wit the Devil, the level's outrageous
When my niggas slip and my dawg Macadascious
Don't act like you don't know
'Cause me and you both, know you're a hoe
So I remain insane
Better watch your mouth when it comes to my name
Game's for the players, but I be a coach
Every where I go bitches givin' up the chonch
Askin' me Lil' can you come across me
Just like Slide, can you fondle me and floss me
Double cross me, hang, dead
Keep up on your knees and play wit my head

[Chorus: ]",Lipstick
Mr. Lil One," 

(Verse 1)
It could be the right time
middle of the night time.
Sip a little wine for the stress in tha mind.
Show you how I make mine,
Nobody could take mine.
Heard it through the grapevine,
but it really ain't mine.
Never really was every time I get a buzz.
Shoot it to tha left like a real ?g? does.
Yeah just say no but ain't got a halo.
All I gotta do is lay low from the po-po.
Listen to the cholo, blowin up solo.
Holla at a playa we could hook up at the mo-mo.
Chill at the Ramada, do whatever you want to,
Do whatever we gotta and never say nada.
Now you want to sex me? Girl you want to test me?
Girl you better know the whole world respects me.
Come by the fire, chill with a player.
How you admire these words that'll save ya.

(Chorusx2)

Stay with me, never leave
Stay with me, help me breathe
Stay with me help me be, help me be the best of a man that I can be

(Verse 2)
Now the moods getting righteous, baby don't fight this.
Move it like that, yeah I like this.
What about 4-play? Beat it up all day.
Will I still love you in the morning? Always.
Show you what I mean every time that I speak this.
You know what I mean girl; you know how to treat this.
Never be the one to put the lil in the mix.
You and me alone in the night? Shit.
Climaxin, body bakin, makin me high like Toni braxton.
Askin questions will I ever mention any lil secret?
I promise that I?ll keep it.
Just go along with your cardio.
Just bring yourself and the bacardi on.
The rest is fine just keep the faith
just you and me that's all it takes.

(Chorus x2)

(Verse 3)
Now I feel the pressure think I'm gonna measure
Every lil thing that we done to the bone.
Break it on down when it?s me and you alone.
Now it?s getting drastic every body askin
Is it really true? You my lil lady?
What you really think I?ma tell em? lately?
Tell em how I really feel about the deally
Tell em how I really feal about the kiddy.
What about tomorrow got about one time
Never give away what's mine right?
Most of these knickle be	?s
tryin to play a game with g?s.
and that be the difference for instance
ever since this affair we?re both aware.
It?s me and you and you and me.
Stay with me, stay with me.

(Chorus x2)",Stay With Me
Mr. Lil One,"Hey Shadow

Sup Dawg

See that mothafucka over there tryin to mad doggin
He's lookin like the sun's up in his face
You know why

What's up

Look at his girl
She's lookin at who?

Us

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I remember when I met you
I knew I had to sweat you
Had me all erected so how could I neglect it
Seen you around meant your man was in the county
Set to serve a bid now I'm headin to where you live
I got me a posse forget you or not
Maybe we could talk and exchange our iner thoughts
Knowin one another but keep it undercover
I got to keep a secret if I want to be your lover
Now keep it on the down low, nobody knows
Sippin on my beer as you're whisperin in my ear
Tellin me your real and that you want to feel
Like you would ever leave me, descive me, believe me
Never have I trusted a women that I lusted
Now were always screwin and nobody could ruin it
that's what you told me, when you would hold
Now I hold a grudge from the colors that you show me

I got scopes that are deadly like strokes when I roll by
Everybody sayin hi, I'm not knowin why
All up in the mix and still triple sixen
I brag when I sag with a bag full of trixes
Stay away from the rain when it falls
The baddest of them all hit it up on your walls
Kinda like Ruch Banis I got the fame
I'm young and bad and I'ma blow up like his plane
It gets kinda a critical when I get lyrical
Words that I speak got your fiendin like tweak
Show em no pity down to the grity
Kinda like when Jesus got jumped by a whole city
It gets scary so watch who you marry
She might be the first one to laugh when you're buried
Take you for your goods all alone in the woods
Sufferin lonely what about your homies
Everybodies fake so watch who you trust
The girl that you love is the girl that I lust
Watch as I take her, show you she's a faka
Go ahead baby shake your money maker

I creep and I crawl
I shoot and make em fall
I'm posted on your walls
Now who you gonna call
It's me and my dawg through the fog breakin laws
2 bald headed thugs with the slugs for the cause
Pause, hold up, wait up, and give me an minute
Remember it was you and only you all up in it
But all of a sudden, your mind went through changes [changes]
Never talk to strangers [strangers]
You should of told her, beggin me to hold her
Look over your shoulder Hi it's me
And all because of a rap got a knife in your back
You're crazy for life now she's gonna be your wife
Now ain't that a shame when she calls out my name [Shadow]
So how do you feel, are you fake or ya real
So why don't you come and face me
You lick her and you taste me
And even though you hate me
I'm knownin that you praise me",Excited
Mr. Lil One,"[Mr. Lil One Talking]
Yeah, between me and you
sorry, sorry, we all got a lot to deal with
but you're the only one we gotta keep it real with

[Verse 1]
Dear god, forgive me for my sins, i've been trippin
I made promises to you about my drinkin
About my kids, and the way that I've been thinkin
Sometimes I feel like my world is slowly sinkin
I need a bottle to relax me and calm me
All that bottle ever did was really harm me
But should I call me, I'm speakin hypocritical
I got alcohol in me and gettin lyrical
I feel you in my presence on a daily
And I'm grateful that you gave me healthy babies
But not to shy away, I'm hurtin for a reason
I apologize, I'm sorry for the teasin
And I pray you don't forget me and protect me
I don't blame me if you don't like or respect me
But you know me like nobody else
Please forgive me, don't leave me by myself

[Chorus 2x]
Sorry for the mishaps, I never meant to fail you
There's another million things I want to tell you
Keep me strong through my rights and my wrongs
Thank you for my kids, my life and my songs

[Verse 2]
I remember a couple months back, how I pleaded to you
I remember every word and I'll repeat it to you
Get me outta this, I'm in a jail cell
And if I let you down, send my soul to hell
Well I did, and I deserve for you to leave me
I'm speakin on the truth, and I hope that you believe me
Pleaded for my freedom, I put that on this earth
Don't want to miss my little baby girl's birth
And you let me walk away and kept me happy
And kept the faith that nothing would distract me
Keep my word, do whatever not to break it
Keep it real right? I'd never thought I'd fake it
Not with you, but I did, I feel broken
Will you accept me with your arms wide open?
I hope you feel my pain and my repent
I hope you get this little message that I sent

[Chorus 2x]
Sorry for the mishaps, I never meant to fail you
There's another million things I want to tell you
Keep me strong through my rights and my wrongs
Thank you for my kids, my life and my songs

[Mr. Lil One Talking]
Yeah man, you make a pact with god, then you make a pact with god
Make a promise, don't break it man
He's the man, he's the king, he's our father
And that needs to be respected, I'm ashamed
And I'm sorry, sorry, sorry",I'm Sorry

(Verse 1)
well its loced out Lil one and I'm comin all up in here blastin
Everybody want to know where I want to go got em' all askin
Wantin me to ride nut em' all up inside but I got pride
And I feel none of them are real so I never kneel to a pair of heels
And I know how to read a mind give a Lil time and I will devine anyone
That'll wana go showin off a gun when you never done redrum
Ready boy you better be if you ever want to get ahead of me
I be locin provokin anybody that I wana smoke as I start em' all up in a path
Give a good past then I'm gonna laugh and I'm gonna go lay a little low
so the 5-0 will never know that I'm gonna lead em'
I'ma defeat em' ain't no one to lead em' anywhere I feel
Still I gotta be the man of rhymes when I'm in your minds friends full of lies
When you gotta a whole lot of ends then you got a whole lot of them friends
But you gotta be the one to know when they want to come put a Lil show
So I give em' all a big smile write em' up put em' all up in a file
and I send em' on their way as they all say

(Chorus 4X)

(Verse 2)
Now before I get up in the mix let me run em' all down how I get down
I be one of a kind every mankind will you find of mine
That so sick like a berreta that I never let another get ahead of me
I be all up in your thoughts feel the gun shots now your full of blood clots
Any one that'll feel against this suspense well your fin to rest for a long time
Never drop a dime not a good sign when your in a pine box
And all want to reminisce you all the girls want to come and kiss you good bye in the lips
Why wait till your dead all in the mix if you never have then you never should
'cause I never would even though I could. Still I had to give em' all a diss
And I insist that you never risk any one with a right mind 'cause you might find that
Your really no good then screw ya went through ya now do ya feel the voodoo
Goin all up in your veins ain't that a shame
now you really feel the pain and there's no one there for you to lean on
now you gotta go and get your fiend on
And know I be the one baller lil one can I get a dollar?
Hell no first I gotta hear you holler

(Chorus 4X)

(Verse 3)
Now never could I be the one that'll run rather over come
Any class of a man now I gotta ban anyone
that'll stand in my way only one way
that I'll ever pay that's your death
As you know this rigormortis by the man named in the chorus
I gotta be the baddest of them all never will you find even a little flaw
This locness and dopeness leavin all my nemesis hopeless
And never find a man that'll make any man have a doubt what he's all about
Take him on a route with the grim reaper
So why would you want to diss?
Now I gotta leave you in a bloody mess
Any body else that'll run around
dig em' in the ground
find em' all spellbound
And get em and I'm gonna wet em
bloodshed oh never will I ever let em
Escape me elevate me said you hate me
but you can't take me
See lil one be the baddest
well mad man be the maddest
and we got em all up in the mix
Everybody want to come and get a glimpse
of them locs with a sick mind 619 right around time

Do you wanna wait, and all you can see is me.

I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving

That one day we'd be fightin' in the suburban war

But by the time the first bombs fell we were already bored
We were
Already

I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it

But in my dreams we're still screamin and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally Fall

It meant nothin'

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling, and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
Show her some beauty, before the damage is done
But if it's too much to ask
If it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot I'm still waiting
It's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass

I'll ask if I can walk you home

Grey like the gravel under our shoes
The sky doesn't clarify
Simple is something of a mystery
No longer making sense to me

Got a gun and an eagles eye
But would like somewhere safe to hide
You've a reason and so have I, it's true

I'm gonna rescue you
So you can rescue me too
Make it a rendezvous

I got my best dress on
And you've a smile and a bruise
So come and rescue me,
And me you

I am the heat in an empty room
The cold coming through the walls
Your sofas' old, but I am new
And there is better on the brew

My breath is soft, your hands are unlocked
Un-manned and un-vertical
I feel strings without the black n blues
A weekend in a weekdays shoes

Got a gun and an eagles eye
But would like somewhere safe to hide
You've a reason and so have I, it's true

I'm gonna rescue you
So you can rescue me too
Make it a rendezvous

And old men embedded the game and aim 4-5's
And blindsided females, we mesmerize them
See, hell, we're live men, broke as fuck, no lyin
So what's up? I make a whole city get em up
And I know white folks is racist, cousin, I don't really give a fuck
Patience, don't be sayin that, sling the dopest rhymes like crack
Take a look around you, all your boys is layin on they back
Makin noise and bangin tracks, trained to kill on contact
Can't nobody hold me back, hate me or give up some dap
Take me somewhere off the map, gee, tell us where the party at
Show respect and then reject, the fellas don't know how to act
Blaze a sack of bombay, can we do it all way?
In school I was a fool, catch me screwin in the hallway
Ball all day, if I ever fall, it's on my knees to pray
Jesus bless my soul, needin dough I sold a ki of lley
Hopin it won't end this way, runnin from the D.E.A.
When they come investigate, you better have your story straight
Ain't nothin poppin bout no broke nigga, black nigga

A trip, back to kick dust, nigga what?
Cussed my teacher out, got expelled, bailed to the weed house
Hell, don't underestimate me or doubt me, I'm great
And highly educated, bitch, all about my papes
But in the States down MC's can't's see me, straight from the underground
Niggas can't bring me down, that's why they start to hate me now
Escapin town and do all my dirt all by my lonely
They actin wild, it hurts, don't run up on me

The game's deep, now can you see us, me and Mack One-o?
To hell where some go, a don that's velcro
We bail and bomb while some fail to turn pro
So act like you know, hey hoe, best not doubt me
Niggas don't mob without me, ain't nothin fraud about me
Time tickin, mind spinnin, can you dig these wicked rhymes?
Gettin live, what's the deal with his eyes? Devil I despise
Sniff em out like bloodhounds, lyrically puttin my thug down
Seriously, why'all can hunch now, spiritually we been drugged down
I'm your host now, who's the boss? Niggas get lost and broke down 
Crossed with golden crowns, then you hear me more than now
A million ways to lay the game out
I went without a million days before I came out

[ VERSE 2: Mack 10 ]
I stay stressed out and short with nowhere to turn
I'm out of dope, it's a drought the whole hood is concerned
I gotta take what I want, I never learned how to earn
I pull my heat out and squeeze, yelli, ""burn, baby, burn!""
With no rocks to sack up I wonder who can I jack up
Along with this .44, which other heat should I pack up?
Niggas never been robbed by a guy short in size
If I put a 211 in progress, cooperate or die
Why fall in love with the struggle if the struggle don't love me?
So nigga, why should I watch you hustle off a whole ki?
If I say I want it, hand it over or watch the snub nose flame
The Chicken Hawk got to have it, dog, and that's on everything
Now Mr. Mike (What's up?) You out here ballin these streets
Now front your partner a few ones, until he back on his feet
And that ain't askin for much if that's somethin that you can do

I ain't makin this up, nigga, you made me come)
Alright we done, back to the lab without a mic to grab
Can't take this poverty, crews sling
We hoo-bang for the robbbery (Who's game?)
The chosen one, three years old, know how to hold a gun
I'm on the run till I finally find the right one
Mr. Mike, guns and glocks can't stop me
Cause we here tonight, love and props is all I see
Somebody callin me, I'm dealin with these inner feelings
Show my partners the game, a damn shame, they still don't get it

Y desde que tú te marchaste 
El sol ya no brilla igual si tú no estás aquí 
Me visto de noche y estrellas 
Estrellas que lloran porque te alejas de mí 

Aunque intenté buscarte en los labios de alguien más 
Al corazón jamás lo puedes engañar 
Pues cuando cae la noche solamente pienso en ti 
Hoy me hace tanta falta que tú estés aquí 

Y desde que tú te marchaste 
El sol ya no brilla igual si tú no estás aquí 
Me visto de noche y estrellas 
Estrellas que lloran porque te alejas de mí",No Estás Aquí

Destiny, now can you tell me wha's tha meanin
Where I'm goin in this life,its so trife,I get to skeemin and dreamin
Is thea a way I can make my route pay
Talkin bout tha shit I used to do back in tha day
But hey, times are hard and 4 me its get harder
Got so many problems, they jus build up real quick like tarter
Avoid tha few, and jus hang wit tha crew, as if you didn't knew
It be that Stoneycrook crew, its a hard life
And its affectin me so strong, sleepin hea and sleepin thea
Not havin a place to call my home, this is wrong
I ain't neva had it hard like this
But momma always told it would be a day like this
Dirty po shit, baby I can't do it too long
Cause I don had too much to stay down, gotta eat and stay strong
Even though my brotha, he'll be thea through thick and thin
Won't be gon in tha wind, like so called friends
Pick up tha pen, let if flow like tha Trinity
Problems steady killin me, gotta get some ends in my vicinity
I'm in it deep, reep when I'm smashin on yo homies
I didn't want to do it, me and my baby need some money
Hungry for this rap shit, phony, oh no, not this
Wanted by tha po-po's, they won't get me, I'm too swift
Dip off to tha Cliff, K-Roc fiya up this splif
Ain't nobody pagin me, cut our pager off this hip, its a trip
Chorus[x4]
Wha is my Destiny? Tell me
[K-Roc]
Got some problems in my mind, rewind, so I can find it
These niggaz need to realize, my team gon keep climbin
To find tha true meanin, haitian, devestation
Not knowin wha you're facin, can be a lifetime complication
So I'm lacin, these blunts wit weed, keep my G's, right beside me
I dunno where danger is goin to find me
Behind these doors that's where I stay
Wit a blunt up in my mouth and a cocked AK
And each day, I get tempted by these hoe ass niggaz
So-So ass niggaz, jus po ass niggaz
And I been broke before playa, but I kept my dreamin
And I ain't neva lettin it go 4 no goddamn cream
Now fuck a football team, fuck that shit, what this means
Is that I be damned if I'm 40 still servin these fiends
And all tha shit I seen, wasn't no diamonds and pearls
My destiny is to be blind from this fucked up world
Nigga!!!!!!
Chorus[x4]
[Mr. Pookie]
Still doin bad, but life is bout to change
My homie jus called me cause he was bout to lace tha game
You willin to rip it wit Tha Rockla and Tha Rap?
Makin bread off wha you said, puttin Dallas on tha map
Say no mo, I'll be ready when tha time is right
Got to be patient in this game, but that's hard in life
I got to fight, off hataz while I'm duckin tha laws
Keep some money in my pocket, clothes, shoes and draws
Neva pause, if I do I might slip off wit tha lifeless
Beggin to tha Lord, bring me closer to tha brightness
How can I fight this?
A bag of weed, feelin loco wit my crooks, gotta skeem 4 cheese
My opportunity came so I grabbed it
Now I see my future in tha mist of all tha bad shit
Hopin I don't pass it, tryin to keep a job and chill
But now thea's 2 things on my patience, have no time to live
Still feelin like I'm young, but I'm old enuff
I must be trippin, get a hold of it, control tha stuff
Leave tha lust of my dealin wit tha fools who want it
Keep on slangin though you'll find a betta way to get up on it
Listen homie it won't last long, wait til yo cash gon
You gon be feelin bad cause you broke and you smash on
No mo sackin and flippin burgers from scratch
I'm in tha studio, rippin up tracks

Mami I'm fly is an understatement
Come to greatness

[Chorus]
I'm on my own planet. 
I'll do my own thing.
Then turn around and pat myself on the back (for doing good). 
I don't need nobody else.
I'm gonna do it by myself. 
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, (it's all good)

Right of the rip nobody is quite like me.
You gonna need a NASA spacecraft to sight me.
If you don't like me, bite me.
I could give a fuck, less fightin' excites me.
Leanin' on the moon with a patron fifth playin' my own shit.
And I sound terrific.
I'm not cocky, I'm beyond that.
It's time to start another hobby, I'm beyond rap.
Run and tell your baby daddy and your son Ray
I'm hot, I sunbathe on the sun babe
I'm the one on the one way
Hands and pretty long legs from the runway
My nigga Notty is a genius
You gonna need a ladder just to climb on my penis
Got two words for the rap game

Right off the rip, you thought it was a rap for me
Didn't you? Go ahead and admit it hater
Cold as ice I'm a living refrigerator.

I did a bid just for drunk drivin'
It'll never happen again 'cause now I'm drunk flyin'
I'm an innovator
When I say I'm on Venus I don't mean that I'm datin' a tennis player
I'm on Saturn where you don't matter.
Alone, I'm past the zone where your phone scatters.
Hello? Can you hear me now you? 
You don't got a fuckin' choice.

Your scent is in the air 
I've been trying to grasp it 
That we've gone our separate ways 
I'm standing at the window 
Searching for mistakes 
Why you have left me?

But I can't confess 
To describe my conditions 
To recognize my mess 
I promise you to change it 
My morbid jealousy 
Give me one more chance 

I want to be close to you, baby 
I want to be near to you tonight 
I want to be next to you, baby 
I want to be close to you tonight 

If I have one more chance 
To prove my love to you 
I will do it right this time 
Together we'll make it through 
Don't do the silly things 
Don't make the same mistakes 
That I made years ago 

You said that you need me but you used to use me 
So now your time is up you're cryin' how you miss me 
I remember the time when you used to be my cutey

I would cuddle up at night and keep little toes warm

If you would ask what I feel for you 
I'd say thaht my love for you is true

I gave you last year
I won't get caught like that
I swear the tears you shed

Why did you leave me hanging in the den?
Wanted to write but I couldn't find a pen
You didn't even want me
You didn't even care
There is nothing more in common
And nothing more to share
That's it is

Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckers go 
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some 
 
'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
Nah, all of that was on the couch 
No doubt why y'all records spin, why y'all shippin' in gold 
It's cold On The Outside lookin' in (brrrr!) 
 
You'd best a make yourself worthy 
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty 
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit

Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face

I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots

Wants to get close to me

Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
Check yo' bitch 
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses 
 
Oh yes it's very true 
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you 
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
Let her loose or let her remain 

'Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 
Tryin' to trick me 
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsley 
She still hit me 
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I

And tell you how I feel

Love they way you brought out the best of me
We drove another, talked about it, we were meant to be
Baby do you feel the same just don't feel ashamed
I know, I found the cold and lonely you'll erase my pain
I understand you already got a man
Gotta tell you how I feel in case my life comes to an end
But I'm still here for you, real for you
I think that I would pack the steel for you, kill for you
Your all I need, so if you really want to try
Follow your feelings they don't lie
Now dry your eyes and please don't cry
Our friendship won't be jeopardized
Would you do the same for me
Take the blame for me
Baby girl you know that I will never change for me
You know I tell you what I'm made of, tell you straight up
What my feelings for you are really made of

Me and you, we were meant to be
Together, Together for all eternity
Me and you, we were meant to be
Together Together for all eternity

So baby tell me what you think
Yeah, I know, that you need some time to think
And did I catch you by surprise
I think I need to tell you how I feel inside
But baby just remember this
We gave each other our very first kiss
We learned about ""the birds and the bees"" together
Made a promise to be friends forever
And I don't want all that to change
And that you know how just I feel
I just don't want things to get strange
Cause I am here for you, real for ya
You know that I'll still shed a tear for ya, real for ya
Your all I need, so if you really want to try
Follow your feelings they don't lie
Now dry your eyes and please don't cry

Together, Together for all eternity
Me and you, we were meant to be
Together Together for all eternity

I lost you a couple of years ago
And I never got a chance to tell you how I feel
So I made this song for you

The pacts with the church and the new poll tax
I haven't got the pox, I've turned twenty-eight
My mate's thirty-one but he's dying from the plague
Life's a bitch right now and I can still hear the hills
Resonate
Watch my carbon vibrate mate

And I'm way down the mine
In another lifetime
But I don't how this canary keeps chirping
And my lungs are tight
When you've got to keep working
What's the point in life
There's a hundred miners here in the union
March through the manor while the owner takes communion
I'm going in to get my wage for last year
Plus a big bag of food
One of them big chandeliers
I affect the state and affect the earth
And pass my spirit on again
Until it's triggered by a birth
I resonate
You Resonate
I say echo
You vibrate

I'm in this for a better life
Staying clever
Got the soldiers on the hop
Slept in the oak tree
Raided a crop
They probably think I'm catholic
'Cause of my name
I caught the King's deer
They were giving me fame
And they heard about my antics
Up at the castle
When I didn't pay my taxes
Down came the hassle
They burnt my village and my family at the stake
I felt the whole ground shake
Why?
'Cause spirits resonate
They want my pagan head
Turn the hunters in my band and that's as good as it gets
We affect
You affect
Everybody move your molecules
From your nails to your follicles
Vibrate

It's eighteen fifty-six
I'm at the workhouse with my bundle of sticks
These people think I'm nuts
But they won't complain
When their lives get better cause of my campaign
Sabotage man with the Guy Fawkes precedent
Burn the city hall - smoke out the residents
Make a mark in my town and adjust my standard of living
Till my pitchfork rusts
Change the chain
Unchain all hands
Latter-day Scargill
I'll affect this land
I come in peace
From a small piece of dark
And I'm going back soon
So for now I'll make marks

Rock Steady was a B-boy crew, but to me it's all about hip hop,
So, rock steady is a hip hop crew now.  Its about all four elements, And we 
represent those lovely, sratch pickers, arsonists,
All the b-boys that are down with us, the b-girls, we have some dope 
B-girls, and you know, we got graf artists like East and Zero T,
Its just straight up on skills, this is Crazy Legs from the Rock Steady 
Crew, I'm out

Hip-Hop was breaking, spray paintin' full train cars
DJ's cutting emcess presents the ghetto stars
I was the skinny shorty wop, with the bop in my step
Shams the bear and teloids, playboys and I was set
Running through the streets of the boogie with a bang
Pops was kinda strict, so at times I couldn't hang
But whateva the case, I stuck close to my hip-hop
Somethin' in my soul just kept that, on lock

And oppurtunity never knocked, but we was still open
Saying ish like fresh, like def (dope in)
And crack was on the corner rumblin' the dry goods
With something I decided never to persue in my hood
I was, too busy in the middle of the streets playing skelly
With Ray and Big Lou, listenin' to Flash and Melly
And rockin' block parties, seemed to be my route
But I had to give that up, they always ended in shoot outs

Hip-Hop was rhyming, hard timin', radio hits
No dats, so the D.J's was still in the mix
Grafitti and breaking took a back seat
Cuz the A&R's couldn't figure how to make they ends meet
I was the high school rapper to the girls in the hall
While my nigga Clarence Greer was slammin' with a basketball
Tune my radio on a saturday night
Daydreamin' 'bout grippin' mikes and being in the spotlight
Fat rope chains in a pair of A.J's in the p.j's frontin' like I had status
(what) who's the baddest?
The brotha on swinten ave, though fresh out the lab
You just couldn't tell Q-Unique what he couldn't have

It all started in Bushwick, defacin' the community
Around the way, all you saw was nothin' but graffiti
As a shorty I was poppin' never could I ever stand still
Always battlin' cuz it was all about the skills
Never learned windmills, but my boogie took me places
When I started emceeing, I kept it fat like my laces
Wrestlin' was the bomb, kept me from doing my homework
Radio was my thing, when red alert went bezerk

[Chorus] 4x's
Yes yes y'all, let me get some
Cuz we, never forgot where we came from",Flashback
Mr. Scruff,"[ INTRO: Mos Def ]
Baba-baba-baba-baba-baba, you been so good to me
When I was a little boy you were the only one I wanted to be
To be like pa duke and ma duke
How much I love the both of you
I know all the strain we been through
But it's of no consequence cause we're comin through

[ VERSE 1: Mos Def ]
Check it
I first studied my kung fu in the Brakalak
In the center of ( ? )
This had to be about ten years back
Before I ever even heard of a 24 track
Talkin about you was an MC was not the move
Cause if you said you had skill, well then you had to show and prove
And if there ever was a party, son yo, I would set it
And tell the DJ run the beat from (Ultra-magnetic)
I grab the mic and then I leave the party buzzin
Tellin all the honeys I was Slick Rick's cousin
When they knew I wasn't, but I had no shame
Pa, you know the name, the Mos always had game
Back in the day of the Rap Attack
When brothers knew how to act, before glocks and crack
And Vandy see was doin radio shows
And 'crossover' meant that you wore your mom's clothes
When Sweet G was talkin about the games that people play
I used to sit back and say: yeah indeed, someday
And as I grew older my kung fu grew better
Instead of shootin the humbles I was shootin ( ? )
And now my time has come
And now hip-hop's an industry polluted by bums
Posin with guns, they're puffin mad blunts
Aiyo, brothers just started rhymin last month
They gettin fat deals on any major label
When they only seen other people hold the mic cable
Five years ago when we was dancin house
When the DJ played hip-hop, then you walked out
But now you're hard, talkin about you paid mad dues
I used to see your ass abused wearin platform shoes
I ain't confused, who you think you're foolin with that get-up?
You ain't genuine, so don't waste your time
Riffin over here cause there ain't no chance 
That you could break the sound, son, you ain't that advanced
Times are gettin critical across the land
Don't provide the be	-boy, introduce the be	-man - understand?
The M-o-s D is who I am, now check it out, y'all

[ CHORUS ]
My kung fu is the style you haven't mastered

[ VERSE 2: DCQ ]
At the age of 18 made a little money
And I needed some advice on how to live my life
Was goin through strife, people couldn't understand
That I was comin into my own, becomin a man
I had to have a plan cause I know what I'm here for
So I can't waste time, y'all
Gotta be on the ball and represent for my peeps
(Where?) In the streets!
I make beats and kick facts over fat tracks
It's all of that from the Brakalak
Goin through problems as a adolescent
A lot of troubles and turmoils, there was persistence
And I know that I stutter
But it don't matter cause I'm a bad -
I flip a verse either backwards, sideways
I rocks my [edited] from here, Mondays, Fridays
Saturdays and I get a weekend off
My [edited] ain't soft
(Well, excuse me, baby)
You paid your dues cause I'm the boss
So mother[edited] Bruce Springsteen and Diana Ross
Because they know what the time is
I rock [edited] for the fly kids, be	-men, bouncin bass bombastics
Kick it drastic, you get tossed like an ash, kid

[ VERSE 3: Ces ]
Well, I'm sleek and I freak a beat
For you and your peeps to bump inside your jeeps
Your Acura, Honda or whatever
Bump it in the Benzi and get your head together
Strollin down the F.D.R.
Playin the microphone star
Deep in your car
With the thump-diddy-thump-da-thump-da-thump-thump
Pop up the trunk and let the bass bump
If you ain't got a ride, well, that's alright
Let the you keep you company on your hike
Trekin down the ave with your headphones on
Take em off for a sec, you still feel gone
You're pressin rewind, many, many times
I must rock the mic cause it's only right
Comin right up off of Eastern ground
This is how you get down, I hope you like the sound

There's more in store, there's more to come
We far from done, no, the show ain't over
So when we comin through, don't say I never told ya

Drop your heart and gave some love to me
You knew what you had, a nigga with nuts and guns 
Ready to die for ya, do some time for ya

You need to warn me the bitches that pulled the gun

Even when I sold my clothes to pay the bills
You stayed real knew the deal
You love my daughter, even harder like she was yours

When you left me on the grind, you came back
And every time them bitches pulled me over you hide my strap

There for your nigga, say a prayer for your nigga

Gettin' this scrilla for cheese, it's just for you
Remember that gangstas need love too
And ain't no bitch goin ever replace you

Let's leave the hood and take a vacation
Make some bacon, cause this ghetto niggas takin'

Living through life or death, don't ask me why I get my die tonight
I'm dying with my dog in mind, your love is mine

You told them niggas where they're on the grind you'll do time
You for me, that's hard to find 
that's why for you I'll give my life a hundred times
Even when them niggas said they fuck you
I'm ready to pull my strap and blast for you

Push your green nation wide like pharacon
Pushing dream e'ryone on my team then new york got fiends, I mean

You niggas talkin'bout you run out of this and jump out of that
And hit a nigga block, ha
But I don't really think you know what it means 
to run up on a nigga's shit
And take what you want nigga
Cause as long as I can remember nigga
Down south, No Limit
We take what the fuck we want

Ha, I'm addressin to show a lot of niggaz in the rap game, 
shit bout to change
Nigga you gotta know your pay, chose your side nigga, foe or friend
I can't pretend to love a nigga when I know I don't
I can't pretend to love a woman when I know the fuck I won't
Cause eveything I seem to love, seem to leave
And every nigga I see to trust, 
seem to scream jealously and betrail and bleed
How many niggas you know smoke weed to ease the ghost in they mind
How many niggas you know smile when the judge say 99
I know a lot of niggas in the rap game look at the tank on my chest
And you say to yourself nigga, you hate my kind
When you niggas sit on top of the rap game
Ya'll decided to sit back, get fat, smoke weed, get laid
Then we came, nigga starvin in the middle of the night
Like a new young rapper on a New York train
Then we stepped off, pay the toll, nigga you know tanks roll
Why you niggas strollin in your videos in the park
We was wagin bloody war in the dark
And if you about that talk nigga, fuck you

Chorus
You don't know when I hit your block I hit right
You don't know when I hit your block, aight
You don't know when I hit your block, I hit it right
Cause everything in sight gotta die tonight x2

Now ease up nigga, don't make a sound, lay it down
I fuck with the Pound, 
and any new other gang won't make me fuck with this rap thang
I could take each one of my producers, send them each to one of your labels
And you finally get the feelin of what it feels like to get a real hit
And don't be afraid to look at that sound scan shit
Cause with the pound name nigga
You know you be shippin enough out the door
And pay you artist to a video, buy a house for your wife, you know my ho
See I was like Randy Moss, the top draft choice
a lot of you niggas looked at me but you was too scared to touch my voice
But that nigga with the gold teeth picked me late in the first round
Now I get down with young savage niggas
From LA to smoking weed with that nigga Tony from town 87, and Chi town
I even get down with Jack Town Ballers, Mississippi niggas
Callin me on my beeper sayin Serv, nigga you need extra trigger
Forever nigga, that's how I do it when I put it down nigga
If you ain't fuckin with a nigga 
I bang, hang, nigga lesson hang, sayin nigga

Chorus x2

You know what I'm saying motherfucker?
You goin know what's happening
Like that little nigga that like to bark say
Nigga talk is cheap motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin
So when I hit your block you goin know
To the niggaz in the rap game, I know you keep it real",Hit the Block
Mr. Serv-On,"I got money, I got fame, I got houses, cars, stupid shit
Thought everything would be alright
Thought I'd do something for my moms
I'm telling you, I love you mom
I love you baby
Eryn Cierra, I love you
Ha ha, I hate the way I live
I hate the way, I hate it, I hate it
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Chorus: repeat 2X

Niggaz close to me too scared to let me fly
Niggaz close to me ain't scared to let me die
What I'm ridin for, ain't nobody fightin for, ya heard me?
I hate the way I live, I hate the way I live (c'mon, c'mon)

[Mr. Serv-On]
Niggaz act like we was close
I could see it in they eyes, what we had went up in smoke
We used to laugh and joke
When money was small, time to change
I thought everybody would ball, thought if I could call back our life
I guess the bad times when we was broke and down to fight
I'm back to back, pass me a strap, but I feel assed out
It's like I'm the only nigga screamin for the poor niggas down south
The rain seem to cover my tears
I remember the days stealin out of Sears
How am I ever anticipated by bitches killin niggas doing time
And gang related, somebody feel my pain
I thought I'd change, thought I had so much to give
I made a little money, but I hate the way I live
I hate the way I live, c'mon

Chorus 2X

[Mr. Serv-On]
See my life
If it was a book I'd tell my homies turn back the page
Cause it be like I'm a little child 
walking in a man's body lookin for a better age
Cause when I was two I lost my pops and I ain't know what to do
I know what they put my moms through, 
working her fingers to the bone
It was like she was stabbin at her head stone
Get home alone, trying to become a man in this fuckin killers world
And I look up now I'm a father with two girls
what should I do (I love them both)
Hope last, but then I look at the past
See how many niggas fell down
And now I'm sayin damn I could scream for a town
I'll always be rowdy, and I'm always ready to ride
But I put this tank on my chest 
and I'll tell you niggas I ain't scared to die
When I write about it, lot of niggaz read about it, y'all dream about it
What up, y'all niggaz can't fuck with what I stand for
I'm a nigga that'll live this game, 
nigga what you ride for, I know what I'd die for
And when the time come nigga I'm a be my mama's son
And I'm a blast till there ain't no more, c'mon

Chorus 2X

[Mr. Serv-On]
I sit back and I watch women, y'all hooked on crack
And then I say god damn that makes me want to just pull my strap
Get em, get em! The fool out there that's sellin it to em
They pregnant with a baby
I see em through it, I don't and I go crazy if it was my lady
I gotta look back, that's the way life is in these streets
Look back then one day you standing up
And one day it'll knock you off your feet
You got tags on em, I get back and I sit back, 
(what's my name?) You see I'm Serv-On
But the thangs gon' change my fame, maybe if you know my name
It's better than what I can
That's why I try to shield some of these people
You gotta be what only God let you
But then at the same time I'ma be a +Devil+ and get with the +Advocate+
Take it to another level, that's my game, that's my style
You'll never understand what it means to be a father of the child
Ya'll just full of hate, I look back and try to escape
Deep into my dreams, (I hate it) but this is the way it is
I've been a fiend, I've been one
c'mon

Chorus 2X",I Hate the Way I Live
Mr. Serv-On,"Smokin that Cali thang.

Don't be silent ya heard me?
Dawg, just let it be known bro I got much love for you bro
Come on home here
I miss ya

Chorus: Mr. Serv-On (repeat 4X)

I'm fightin tears for the time you spent
When your nights are dark, but in your heart you got a friend

[Mr. Serv-On]
You chose a destiny of prison terms and crack pipes
I fell victim to a world full of hard women and gang life
You did nine, now you got five
And every day I feel like I'm fighting myself just to stay alive
I got a little money but it ain't all that
What's the use of having it if it'll keep you from going back
I saw a look in your eyes like you wasn't scared to die
You lost your mom and your sister in three months
and never once I saw you cry
Maybe it was a soldier thing or you didn't know how
Cause so many nights I pray to God, just look at our life and smile
Cause somewhere in this ghetto life we lost our heart
Now we just a bunch of helpless souls searching for heaven, play your part
I witness you fight the demons in your mind
You told me they come late at night, you know that he was hard to find
But sometimes you gotta sit back and relax, and say a prayer
Cause when all the pain goes away I'll always be there

Chorus 4X

[Mr. Serv-On]
Some of the ??? around the way on they third and fourth babies
I wonder if you was home one of them would be yours
You gotta laugh at that, life is crazy
The other day Larry Tunes got twenty
He said he had to feed his baby, 
pay some bills and take care of his lady
I went around the way and the new thing seemed to be wheelchairs
Either they too blind to see or they just don't care
I saw your grandmother and she looked okay
But you know black women, they strong, they only cry when they pray
And I'm still tryin to bang all the tricks you used to hit up
And as usual they ask me where you at, and tell me what's up
But lately every day, now I caught my hands without a bottle
I guess I feel the pressure of these magazines callin me a role model
I look in these kids eyes and I see confusion
We never knew how bad it was, 
we just wanted to represent, never losin (New Orleans)
And no matter how times get hard
You just think about it, you look in your heart, I'll play my part

Chorus 4X

[Mr. Serv-On]
Oh man
I'm still thinkin bout all the times we had
It ain't the same no more, man you know
The game, the hustlin, none of that
I talked to moms the other day
We tryin to get that appeal together",I'll Be There
Mr. Serv-On,"[Chorus: x2]
When will I see my friends 
As the time go I could never 
When will I see my friends 
In this time lord I need some 
When will I see my friends 
 
Have you ever tried to count every raindrop 
Before it hit the ground probably not better yet 
Count every love one or friend that ain't around I did 
Hopin that the time it took it would ease my troubles in 
The end all I got was to many tears an my reflection in a 
Puddle sometimes I just want to stand in the rain and look up 
With my arms open hopin God could tell me why babies die 
Why my cousin Fish keep smokin, mama told me say a prayer 
And it'll ease the pain you think Mouse before he died 
At lease smile and said his son name I'd give anything 
If I could hear my Aunt Gussie curse me out 
Auntee if you see Randall tell him his pad holdin up and 
Hold me a place in his new house cause so many nights 
I look at my Dun and ask myself what's the purpose its been a 
Long time since I been to church is that reason enough to hurt us 
They told my cousin he got HIV known he facin death he walk 
Around with a smile, every Sunday he praisein a thought he 
Still Gods child and mama lost a nephew and a sister in the same 
Year and never once I saw her just lay down, give up and 
Shed a tear 

[Chorus: x2] 

See Steve in North Carolina lil brother Tony had five 
Mouths to feed, God did Joeys killers know that before they 
Shot him to his knees, God please tell me I'ma I a good father 
My daughter a week old and I can see it in her little eyes she 
Already got a troubled soul and it seem like I'm runnin my last 
And final race if derall and Ken not to busy send a little 
Sunshine to they lonely brother",Murder

Mr. Serv-On,"Niggas realize we all livin' in our last days.
And we all Prime Suspects to the pains of this world.
And just think if you was lookin' eye to eye with your killer.
It's your last breath, it's your last cry.

I go all out constantly thankin' how to get mine
Everything I do is a hustle, pullin' work tryin' to get by
Every time I close my eyes
I'm havin' nightmares of closed caskets faced down
Thankin' is it my time
But got to watch these niggas with the slanted and crooked eyes
Lookin' me straight in my face and I know they be jive
But I make moves like a chess play why'all then I handles mine
I'm pressure stress to the fullest, but only the smart survive
Can I maintain, or will my mama see my name inscribed
Losin' all my faith, chase one bag and weed
That felt in my ear claimin' she can show me a better day
That's why I'm boxin' with the devil, that's why I'm totin' the AK
That's why I'm peepin' through my window every motherfuckin' day
The final chapter want to write me away
But it ain't goin' be that easy, I'm livin' out my own play
I'm hollerin' right, left, never goin' astray

[Chorus: ]
Now why I'm peepin' through my window
These last days got me sleepin' in my steel toes
But I gotta survive, hollerin' how much time
Till I'm just another memory, my name inscribed (Repeat 2X)

I heard a ghetto child cryin' tonight
Sayin' Lord don't let that killer nigga take my life
But the reaper breathe death and he came to visit
Layin' shaking with his bacon, hot fry to the finish
Babies dying, mama's crying, yellow tapes around the scenes
The last day's right before us so I run and catch my niece
Paranoid with my gun, thinkin' I could be next
Trust in a few, niggas blastin' at me to rest

Now see that drama that I'm bringin', half of these niggas can't even touch
Now see these last days and times, they got a nigga mind fucked up
But I gotta maintain and keep my composure
That's why I smoke dolja, cause see it's trife down south
They takin' it off your shoulders
And bloody bodies just an everyday thang
Motherfuckin' consequences if you hang where I slang
Look it's this thang you get banged
On my block is how we do it
Shit is real these days, use that vest, I'm comin' through it
Nigga fuck who mourn, your best bet is to protect your neck
And never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
There's a constant threat in the N.O.
That's why I'm peepin' through my window
That shit is grimy in the gumbo

[Chorus: ]

Check it
These streets is dangerous and life is hard
Murder murder's in my eyes, take it away my Lord
Cause ever since I was a lil nigga
Chasing Nike's and Hilfiger
I never knew one day that I would have to kill nigga
I ain't never had shit, I'm straight from the ghetto where niggas are poor
Crack heads are hangin' in front of the corner store
Chasin' little bitty pieces of flow
Everybody want to be like Master P, tattoos screamin' out they 'bout it
Could why'all make a change and be up out the game
I really doubt it doubt it

If your ass wants to live another day
Get the fuck out of my way when I lyricly slay
Bring it on all my foes
Mr. Shadow be the one killing mothafuckas
Like told shove em all in holes
Lke a ghost I'ma hauncha mothafuckas make the stories tie
I can hear the cries I sing when you bring it with more jealousy
I give a bullet and begin to do the fool like I do that vatos mine
To the night with a sight when
I look the moon is full and get tool and look for my foe
Got that five footed star on my chest so you know what it is that I'm searching for
Murder you heard of me makin it dark like an eclips
Like ""Tales From the Crypt"" I come equipped with the triple six
And I'm bound to get sick
It's The evilest lyricist bringing this wickedness nemisis
Giant on my premisis withnessin part like the Exorcist
Cause I'm comin to get em like every day
You run and you can hide but you won't get away
It's the game that I play like the quija board
You can't see me but you will believe me, and need me
If you look a little closer you can see The Shadow of a demon appearin
I'm hearing the voices that tell me to do the evil shit that I do
And you know that I'm due so I do when I cast my spell on you
The evilness just fell on you and I'm the perfect fool to wish HELL ON YOU

You know it's gonna happen tonight
But of course, 781 to your area

Creepin up on your ass you won't even see or hear me coming
Be running I'm becoming some thing evil fuck people fuck sequals
Got to get the murder done now, all I see is the fear in your eyes
Your tempature rise, You're terrorized
Don't be surprised, I see my reflection like a mirror in your eyes
Every thing gots a price, but you got a price to pay
I sold your life away, you stole a slice away
Dealin with your life I took your strap, your price is right
Could tonight be the night that I feel some thing come over me
I don't know what it is with a devilish grin
Foes and friend and bloody sin
Don't know when it's gonna end
Just like a puppet on a string he'e controlin me
I try to be cutting those string but like smokey he gots a hold on me

That's the fool that rolled on you
That's the fool that stoled on you
What the fuck you gon do
Fuck it I'll do it for you

I'm having a conversation with somebody who's not even there
Hearin the voices inside my head saying you'll get no where he you care
I be the Lil' Rob going insane when he calls me name
I'm hearing voices in my head and every night I do what said

[Demon Voices]
Lil' Rob... tonight is the night
I better listen to my master
It's good bye, tonight is your night
You should of never messed with me
Never mess with, maricon

And I know you like it like porn treat the streets like hors leave em torn
In drop my rhymes like the storm when it rains it pours
I take form and I...
Hit the streets looking all nice and neat top fully creased
One hell of a looking beat the least of my feats from west to east
From north and south not knowing what it's all about top me on scout
Looking for my new recruits to follow my foot steps down my route

But if not your better pray cause I'm coming your way

Krimes pays when ever the fuck I inflict pain with pick
And I'm coming to stick you let satin be with you

I'm pist you missed Apocalypse, I can't resist the bloodyness
The mess ain't over on 31st of October, I toldcha
The Virgin Mary won't hold, I'll scoldcha and moldcha into a deamon screamin

Tell what you think then I will meet you at the crossroads

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I remember when I met you
I knew I had to sweat you
Had me all erected so how could I neglect it
Seen you around meant your man was in the county
Set to serve a bid now I'm headin to where you live
I got me a posse forget you or not
Maybe we could talk and exchange our iner thoughts
Knowin one another but keep it undercover
I got to keep a secret if I want to be your lover
Now keep it on the down low, nobody knows
Sippin on my beer as you're whisperin in my ear
Tellin me your real and that you want to feel
Like you would ever leave me, descive me, believe me
Never have I trusted a women that I lusted
Now were always screwin and nobody could ruin it
that's what you told me, when you would hold
Now I hold a grudge from the colors that you show me

I got scopes that are deadly like strokes when I roll by
Everybody sayin hi, I'm not knowin why
All up in the mix and still triple sixen
I brag when I sag with a bag full of trixes
Stay away from the rain when it falls
The baddest of them all hit it up on your walls
Kinda like Ruch Banis I got the fame
I'm young and bad and I'ma blow up like his plane
It gets kinda a critical when I get lyrical
Words that I speak got your fiendin like tweak
Show em no pity down to the grity
Kinda like when Jesus got jumped by a whole city
It gets scary so watch who you marry
She might be the first one to laugh when you're buried
Take you for your goods all alone in the woods
Sufferin lonely what about your homies
Everybodies fake so watch who you trust
The girl that you love is the girl that I lust
Watch as I take her, show you she's a faka
Go ahead baby shake your money maker

I creep and I crawl
I shoot and make em fall
I'm posted on your walls
Now who you gonna call
It's me and my dawg through the fog breakin laws
2 bald headed thugs with the slugs for the cause
Pause, hold up, wait up, and give me an minute
Remember it was you and only you all up in it
But all of a sudden, your mind went through changes [changes]
Never talk to strangers [strangers]
You should of told her, beggin me to hold her
Look over your shoulder Hi it's me
And all because of a rap got a knife in your back
You're crazy for life now she's gonna be your wife
Now ain't that a shame when she calls out my name [Shadow]
So how do you feel, are you fake or ya real
So why don't you come and face me
You lick her and you taste me
And even though you hate me
I'm knownin that you praise me",Excited [Featuring Mr. Lil One]

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely

Mr. Shadow,"Hi this is Steve Austin
Reportin' live from San Diego, California
I'm here wit two controversial rappers from the city
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow A-K-A The Mayhem Click
And we're talkin' about rumors
Now Lil' Rob we understand you have an album out entitle the Crazy Life
Can you tell us what kind of rumors have you murder sense the release of that album
And some of the things you been through

Well let me put it like this
All this fools talkin' shit all the time
I was sixteen wit the bullet representin' the 6-1-9
But this fools couldn't take it, they didn't want me to make it
And so they rather hate it because they just can't fade it
Gang related, situated, now I'm back
This putos talkin' smack but I kind of like that
In a way, in one day, I might say that the ones who helped me do this
Had it any other time and I knew this I'm still foolish fools are clueless
To what I can do wit my ability thought of myself as a cholo not a real MC
And so I did what I did, I'm so glad that I did it
Because it put some chips in my pocket when I finished
Using words like Homes, Simon, and Leba
People try to put me down but end floatin' on the river
See I told you twice before but I'll say it one more time
You do your thing Homes but I'm gonna do mine

[Chorus: x2]
Look at all this rumors
Started by jealous people

And basically that's what I think
All this fuckin' fools can talk all the fuckin shit they want about me
'Cause I can give a fuck you know what I mean
It proves that I'm above their level, You Know

So Shadow we understand you havin' similar problem as those of Lil' Robs
Is there anythin' that you would like to say
To them Player Haters and if so what would it be

Man I gotta give it up to the punks tryin' to diss me
Talkin' mad shit 'cause they miss me
Reminisce me because they use to talk head about my rhymes
And when they heard me in the radio they requested till I die and I must admit
That I love you yappin' lips
'Cause it makes me ride my rolas amd my music stacks my chips
Mr. Shadow the crazy vato that fools wanna battle
When they end up undergravel when they act like who's in tattle
Now Why would you want part of this truthfulness
Don't get caught up in the mess
'Cause I hate them phony putos dippin' all up in my business ese
Got hate straight for all the fools that player hate
'Cause ain't no punk chavala stoppin' me from makin' bake
I don't need to take it to make it like claus I brake it unfaded
I be remainin' like say it I'm servin' hate to those perpetrated it

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel
Gotta tell them haters that ah
You can only witness what you see not the things you hear
Remember that

Sense we're talkin' about rumors
I heard that Lil' Rob and Shadow weren't always the best of friends
So Shadow can you clear that up for us and tell us what's really goin' on

Simon, we had some problems like a dose we had to squash it
We're from the Mayhem Click (WHY?)
'Cause everybody wants it
The baddest mother fuckers now together no one is ever gonna
Intimidate us, just imitate us player haters
Don't bother analyzin' anythin' we do
'Cause the shit we kick is tight and you know that this is true
Mr. Shadow and Lil' Rob makin' heads bob and it don't stop
'Cause we're about to keep on flowin' 'til you see our caskets drop

It's the one lil' cholo, back before I go
Just thought that I let you know that you can never stop my flow
So I suggest you put that shit to rest, quit talkin' all the mess
You're talkin' about the best and you're just wastin' your breath
As sit here, thinkin' neva thought it would be you
The city that I represent talkin' all that shit
Because all we do is kick it and mind our own business
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow scratchin' fools off the bitch list

[Chorus: x4]

So now you know where we're comin' from
And wit that it concludes the story for today
I hope you mother fuckers learned your lesson
And learn how to keep your fuckin' trap shut
And quit spreadin' rumors that ain't true
'Cause that shit be gettin' mother fuckers in trouble
And believe me, you don't want part of that
You don't want none of this The Mayhem Click
And we're out",Rumours [Featuring Lil Rob]
Mr. Shadow,"Who's that fool in a 62 Impala
Heard it through the vine
You was mad cause I'ma baller
I'ma tell you how it is
When I thug through these streets
I mob with my dawgs
And these hogs play for keeps
You'll sleep deep in a grave
For misbehaving
Inhalin' the chronic smoke
It ain't know joke I'm gang related
Reinstated by the pecker wood
Situated in my neighborhood
Still an active gang member understood
Now you can find me
After, a bitch that be swingin'
Puffin in the dark see the spark
When I'm hittin' the blunt
They got me spinnin'
Thinkin' up a way
To make a buck
Fuck it I hustle every day
I hate cops and they hate me
Cause I won't stop
To grow my sticky stems of grass
So they wanna burn my crops
Props to all my drug smokin'
Law breakers
Life takers
You better duck and cover
If you's a faker trick

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
I kick rhymes for the bangers
I blast at these haters
Drink Alezaey and smoke weed
With true players

Nothin but smilin faces around me
Lookin out for one time
Cause I don't believe in goin' to county

It's the Mr. Original
Bald headed criminal
Shadow of your life
619 is my area code
My dawg Wicked
Gettin' lifted like a shovel
And if you see my boy Huttle
Then you know your
Hood's in trouble
Cause it be that free wheelin'
Drug dealin' soldier
I want the money and doujah
Fuck exposure
Close your mouth open your eyes
And peep game
How I make it taste dark like my name
Make way CA is the state
SD is my town
Beyond is my label
So you haters bow down
Gangsta style is what I bring
When I create these melodies
Dedicated to them crooks catchin' felonies
Remember me as the stalker of your life
That one man battalion livin' by the knife
Through the night cause I'ma rider
With my poket lighter
Ready to homicide a mothafucka
So trucha cause I'll buck ya
Duck you in the dirt
Like a seed of marijane
Explode like propane
When you step into my domain
The K is what I claim
Mr. Shadow is my name
All I want is the moolah
So fuck you homie and the fame

[Chorus]

Now I'm bouncin' loungin'
Chillin' in a different state
Playa haters stay away
Before you get sprayed
Lay to rest cause in the West
We don't play
Strapped with chrome
Shake dome is the way
Say that one day
Me and you ever clashed
I hate to tell you homie
I'ma have to whip your ass
Twenty five smash while I mash in the lo lo
Trust no man and stay away from the po po
Stay secluded from society
Some stated that I was gonna have
The killer blood inside of me
Sapriety is some thing I never feel
Now my daddy always told me
To be the king of the hill
Shoot to kill
When I be dumpin' on my rivals
I gotta runnin' and duckin'
Make sure there's no survival
So check your vitals
Cause I don't know what you've been sniffin'
And you are wiggin'
If you thinkin' you could ever catch
Me slippin', punk

Slush ""The Villain""
Shadow all up in this motherfucker
Hell a High, off that sticky gram weed
Livin' the thug life, sellin' drug life
Packin' snubs, smokin' weed all day bud life
Can't fuck wit it baby

It's the 'unfadable', confrontation with 'I' is consequential
Me and Slush ""The Villain"" makin' your advisories parental
Fuck a presidential limousine
I roll wit thugs in maxima's on Lomos

Or Impalas on chrome d's 
Follow me and see why everybody calls me hostile
How motherfuckers be hatin' 'cause I live a gangsta lifestyle
My profile is so wild you wouldn't want to kick it

With these two young thugs, packin' snubs and gettin' convicted
Inflictin' much pain like my a.k.a. was migraine
Make a fool swallow piss for disrespectin' my name
From the sky falls rain to the streets, you'll fall victim

And all I got to say to my thugs is fuck the system
The Mistah Shadow is who I be up on this paragraph
Makin' fools panic cause they heard about the aftermath
I'm at the point of no return and so I keep burnin'
Marijuana cause I want the higher learner

[Chorus]
We straight gangstas, bangers, dope slangers
Bitch stranglers, who want to come and playa hate us
Money makers, world wide got it locked
Walkin' 50 deep through your motherfuckin' block

For all my enemies I got them gats too
Me and my faculities bodies covered up with tattoos
So when you see me it's intimidation that you feel
Cause you know these fuckin' Eses mess for real
Cause we're soldado down to throw putasos

Con chiflasos tricky let's throw chingasos
I got Shadow on the side of me
With that gram sticky green mothafucka

Come get high with me
And if you say you'se my homie, don't decieve me
Cause when I say I'm gonna kill, you best believe me

Even out of town we break motherfuckers down like car trouble
Tricky grab an axe and a shovel
Show these sons of hood rats who gots the bag of tricks
Full of guns, ammunition, screwdrivers and ice picks

We pick who dies, when the wolf cries
Brutalize mothafuckas, catch em by surprise
We're unexpekted like a car crash
Head bash a mothafucka, and give him whip lash
Think fast, blink and it's your ass up in pieces
Have your mom screamin for Jesus

[Chorus]
I give's a fuck motherfucker
Down to buck motherfuckers
Better duck or that ass get plucked motherfucker
I got all I need to succeed, let's get to test em'
Pocket full of weed and a gun that's full of teflon

I'm a motherfucker thug with no love
I'm seein' my enemies bleedin' sleepin' in their blood
I'm fantasizin' homicidal thoughts like Charles Manson
Money schemin' plots to come up, like hold you for ransom

It's all about the skrilla homie, I'll put a price on your head
And iIf they don't pay up by mornin best believe that you're dead
Playin wit your life like God but I don't care
Ain't gon let nobody stop me from bein a millionaire

It be a gun blast ese till one of us dies
Best believe tryin' to aim my heat right between your eyes
Only on my bullet, my name I'm gonna engrave

Where's all the freaky, sneaky, kinky bitches
In this motherfucking house that be tricking
Bouncing, smoking, hella drinking
Smoke the crondom, broad what you thinking
Explicit, X-rated to the max
Climax, I got you melting like wax
So take your time
Give me yours and I'll owe you mine
Fill the mind of any man how you shake that figure, shit
I'll blow your mind how I this work finger
Nine milli for the haters, can't nobody fade us
Going down like elevators, rough necks like alligators
It's better late then never, girl you know the rest
Why you trying to be cute, banging fools in a tight dress
You might stress over petty ass shit
But I never have and I won't you punk bitch

You see a dick and you lose control

You freaky bitch don't act like you don't know

Hey dog let's get this shit popping
It ain't stopping till the clothes start dropping
Lights, camera, action
It's Mr. Shadow babygirl, I heard you're asking
Massive exposure, I thought I told ya
You said that you're good but my homeboy knows ya
Back on up
I'm from the West and I'm throwing it up
Blowing up like see-4, dynamite, or black powder
When you come to me it'll be your last hour
Girl how about a trick with your man
Serve my dogs and then get the fuck out
Far out's where we go, a place you don't know
A spot where motherfuckers be taking your hoe
Oh no, how many times did it happen
I don't know but your bitch loves cacking

[Chorus]

There's one more thing
About your bitch and the shit that she brings
Tongue rings, G-strings and lingere
Alize, hennessy, indo smoke and bombay
All day slutty ways, the nerve of this bitch
Like my dog Kurupt said just swerve with this trick
Big thighs, pretty eyes, it shouldn't be no surprise
That your girl was a hoochie fucking so many guys
Spanish fly in her drink, got her thinking X-rated
I guess that's how they penetrated
And you hated, trust no man or bitch on this motherfucking planet

If you're feeling kind of tipsy and high tonight
Take a choke it's time to ride tonight
It's alright on the Westside, the Westside

Break through Stacy Adams, Anchor Blue gangster stepping
Ain't nobody slipping, one of my boys got a weapon
I'm headed to the park, jeans swinging left to right
Feeling alright, keep my dogs all in sight
Baller night, shot caller night, helicopter light spinners
And it's barely the beginning
Hot women spending big faces for hours
Drinking White Russians and Mintory Sours
Leaning like the tower, bent to the limit
Take another shot for the block, homey clear it
I hear it in the back, I hear it in the front
Westside, Killer Cal, whether you like it or not
Posted up at the spot, show me what you got
Next round is on me, believe me it don't stop
Till you drop, that's the was we gonna handle this
From San Diego to Los Angeles we're scandelous

How about we play quarters or spin the bottle
The rule of the game drink it all till it's hollow
Follow my lead, take it to the brain
Whether we're swigging or hitting Mary Jane
If you can't hang or maintain me and my gang
Under control and then we let the shots ring
If you claim to be a baller let it be known

I got a full clip of shells for motherfuckers, you knew you couldn't fool this
So deal with it homey the best that you can
Or I'll come up in your hood and it's just me and my man
We'll be strapped down with guns, got gats in each hand
And I'll do you like Godzilla did to fucking Japan
So embrace a motherfucker like I was a god
And you can meet me in the back and we'll be taking a shot
Breaking em off a little something, man you know how we do it

Nothing but sticky herb swerving down the highway

Fly straight or get your wings cut off
A tatted up G, all you bitches fuck off
A snub nose for all you punk hoes

Now what am I to do
Hoes want to do me, foes want to do me in
Now what am I to do
On the streets with the war, and shit you ain't known
Now what am I to do
I keep breaking the laws, stay rugged and raw uhh
Now what am I to do
If I come to jack him then I'm gonna jack you too

[Mr. Shadow]
What am I to do uhh check it out

This is for my riders who be moving things
Out of state with a full crate doing it big, fooling the pigs
Who's in the mix and who's not
You can tell by the way a fool talks and walks
Around the clock, it's never to late to clock
The longer you stay on the block, the bigger the knot
We plot schemes that turn dreams into real life
Handle our business and do the shit right
Now what am I to do, yeah
The streets are loyal so I gotta stay true
Paid dues and the game will pay you, that's real
Don't try to act sick, you'll sit down for your last meal
The battle field is made out for real soldiers
Bald motherfuckers with stripes on they shoulders
Nothing can hold us now, we full throttle
Money talks, bullshit walks, that's the motto

[Chorus]

Kickin' up dust, we kickin' up dirt
Your picking up ounces, we pickin' up birds
Under no circumstance do anything piety
Why risk your ass trying to cop a quick twenty
Every motherfucker I work with is major
Nobody menos, nobody can break us
Move makers, from Diego to Vegas
Real players with the name you can't blame us
Haters can't stand the next man doing better
First you gotta master the skill to make cheddar
Faster than the average when it comes to stacking cabbage
It ain't a hobby motherfucker it's a habit
I have it in my blood (what) to taste lute
And take fruit to the cranium harder than titanium
It's like a stadium we all play in it
Some of you lose and most of us come out winnin'

[Chorus]

If you all about banging, making others hate you
They hate you cause you doing it right, plain and simple
Sicko ass fools with tattoos, on the free way
In Sunny Southern Cali, CA is where we play
Gangs, ten steps ahead of these lames
Shipping out full crates from the state where it never rains
Don't complain or take two to the brain
I'll drag your body like the foot drags a ball on the chain
You say nothin' when they ask you somethin'
You get the run in or get done in when I'm dumpin'
13 rounds that's the sound, then you hit the ground
You ain't safe or sound when I'm around
Now everybody listen, stop, look
Lie straight or get booked by this Southside crook
Yeah, I leave em shooked in the state of shock
Don't get caught on my block with no strap and your pants drop

Now what am I to do, to do, to do, to do",What Am I to Do

What are my options other than to just sit and just watch it?
Have them take action and try to stop this, nonsense, 
Crying alert and trying to feed, never thought I'd wake up to see
The mark of the beast, but I did now how can I sleep
I can't even dream without even?
To help with keep up with the conscience
And by that I mean awake, 
Cause now I'm feeling that sleeping was my biggest mistake
But I don't know

How can you sleep in these troubled times ( I wanna
Sleep but I don't wanna let my guard down)
How can you sleep in these troubled times (I can't
Sleep my gears are grinding too hard now)
How can you sleep in these troubled times (I never
Sleep more than four hours at a time now)
How can you sleep in these troubled times ( I don't
Even wanna lie down, because if I do then lights out)

Super insomniac rolling up comiac? Blunts in a Pontiac
Like pardon me, honey, but where is your mommy at
Fighting for innocence. Trying to be militant
Even though at times I'm high and belligerent
Lighting a cigarette, not with tobacco in it
But don't start acting strange and stuff
These ingredients ain't as dangerous as angel dust
I promise you I've never been violent or psychotic, 
Dude but at times I just might forget who I was talking to
But that's the worst of it. At least I know what my
Purpose is I never swerve it? If it was legalized I would purchase it
Or perhaps that's the deprivation and later when I awaken
I can meditate over my statements, but fuck it
You need to know this. Every song recorded
Should reflect a moment in the life of the person that wrote it
As well as the personality of those that support it
And if you disagree, may the cousin of death leave you slaughtered
Because you're sleeping

How can you sleep in these troubled times ( I wanna
Sleep but I don't wanna let my guard down)
How can you sleep in these troubled times (I can't
Sleep my gears are grinding too hard now)
How can you sleep in these troubled times (I never
Sleep more than four hours at a time now)
How can you sleep in these troubled times ( I don't
Even wanna lie down, because if I do then lights out)

Who can you turn to? (when you're in a rut and uh)
Who can you turn to? (when you're fucked up and uh)
Who can you turn to? (when you're feeling stuck and ya)
Who can you turn to? (feel like everything sucks. Tell me)
Who can you turn to? (when you're feeling stressed and uh)
Who can you turn to? (when you're in a mess and ya keep hearing)
Peace and love are the only keys to gladness

Yeah that's what they say to me
So I go day to day trying to live patiently
Pacing myself. Staying as safe as can be
Walking with broken two wings
Adapting, while time keeps changing degrees rapidly
You can tell by cracks in the streets
Because it's aging, but see
But amazingly not one agency
Has concerns for saving things
Except for maybe me and my people
Who stay with me fighting courageously
Haters who sleep major, but can't take it from me
Because I never sleep",I Can't Sleep
Mr. Toma,"Refrain
Je chante pour ne pas oublier
Je chante aussi pour supporter
Les peines, les larmes que je croise
Le temps qui marque les visages
Les larmes dans les yeux des autres j'aimerais les sécher.
Moi je passe mon temps à combattre le vent
Pour ne pas changer de direction
Si bien souvent, je sais ce qui m'attend
Une route chargée de victoires
Et de déceptions
Mais je tape dedans
Toujours droit devant, même s'ils veulent m'empêcher de tourner en rond
Depuis trop longtemps moi je serre les dents
Trop de baltringues, trop de bouffons
Trop de stars en carton
Ici tu dois trouver ta place
Tout faire pour que jamais ils ne t'effacent
J'bouge travaille, transpire et me déplace
Pour pas m'retrouver coincée dans un sas
J'fais ma musique pèpère, j'esquive les crasses
Dans ce biz ne me dit pas qu't'es efficace
J'aime pas quand ils pissent là ou je passe
Dans ce couloir on marche tous la tête basse
J'veux pas m'fondre dans la masse
Donne moi un micro pour qu'j'travaille
Pour qu'ils n'oublient pas ma face
Leur fashion me dépasse le micro mon arme fatale mes lyrics, mon famasse
J'aime quand la basse frappe qu'elle te tabasse
Etre sur scène, voir que des foules s'amassent
Bien longtemps que j'ai fait mes classes
J'livre bataille, j'ai semé mes grains et maintenant je les ramasse.
On ne court pas après les mêmes choses
C'est toujours les mêmes qu'ils exposent
Prêts à accepter tout ce qu'on leur impose
Si c'est pas pour faire rentrer les bifftons que le mic je l'explose

In my heart the sharpest pain
The darkest clouds up in my brain
Anger so immense and rage so deep
Each time he took one away from me
It's only now I see
They were angels too good to be
Here in this hell on earth and so he set them free
Only now I see, now I'm sure
I don't want no more brothers and sisters
Growing up in this cold world of war

[Chorus x2]
I ain't ready to die
But I ain't afraid to die
And go check my
Bro's and sisters on the other side

[Verse Two]
Everyday they still walk with me
Every night they still talk with me
They spirit deep in my soul
They oh so far but they closer than close
It's only now I see there's no more tears to shed
I done some crazy shit to ease all the mad confusion
And numbness in my head
Only now I see it's alright
Good hearts don't die
They just fly to be in peace
Beyond the sky

[Chorus x2]

[Breakdown]
Where there's no evil and no greed
No sign of war cause everybody's free
Where only joyful tears are cried
There's no pain
No tears
No lies
He'll free your soul
Free your mind
When it's your time
Your time

Ms. Dynamite,"[Verse One]
When I'm with you I only feel completness
I can feel taste on my lips
It's so hard to conceal the weakness caused by your fingertips
If I told you just how deep my lovin' really goes for you
And that you got all my trust
If you knew tell me what would you do?

[Chorus]
All I ever want to do is love you
That's why I take the time to make it special
Night after night
Night after night
Everything I have is yours only yours
Bothing ever touched my soul like this before
Feels so right
Feels so right

[Verse Two]
Now if I told you that you're worth the world and all it's love to me
If I told you that I want to birth a family with you some day
If I told you that I want to grow old together what would you say?
If I was to let you know I want to see forever with you
Would you run away?

[Repeat Chorus]

If I told you I want to be your drive
Your strength and courage when your weak
I send my angels out every night to protect you from the street
If you knew I'd sacrifice almost everything to keep you happy
Would you let me love you for life
It's all I want It's all I need

I was the oldest and responsibility

Ms. Dynamite,"Yo I'm that same little girl that grew up next door 2 u
Went through all the things a teenage girl goes through
Hangin' out all night and breaking my curfew
When my daddy hit the door I gave my mumma the blues
Use 2 spend my time blazin' lazin' days away
Thought I was grown left home at 15 didn't wanna obey
Had 2 get my act together couldn't take the heat
And now I'm makin' beats 4 the streets

And I come 2 rock da show

Everybody loose control
Let my vibe 2uch ur soul

I remember all the house parties that took place
Bein' in my bed upstairs and we could still feel the base
And my cousins and my brothers we'd sit up all night
Listenin' 2 my family vibin' till the mornin' light
Remember my first years of school I was so innocent
I just wanted 2 learn I never been so content
But the more that I learned I found a guidin' light
That showed me the need 2 fight

Let my vibe 2uch ur soul

At 13 I thought that I was in love with this guy
Anytime I caught his eye I thought that I'd just die
Remember playin' class clown I was just a disruptive fool
And the beatin' that I got first time suspended from school
Remember Sunday School and after go 2 grammas 4 lunch
Macaroni, rice and peas, chicken and pineapple punch
Never had much my mum brother sister and me
But love was enough 2 succeed
2 grow

Ms. Dynamite,"I don't want to be the one to turn and walk away
I still feel you in my heart but I just can't stay
I ain't nobody's fool, I know just what I'm worth
I know what I want, What I need, What I feel that I deserve
You said you want to be someone
Said you want to get out the game
And I'm hearin' all your talk but I ain't seein' no change
You say you want to grow wit' me and uplift each others minds
But baby all you're showing me is you wasting your time

[Chorus]
I just gotta let you know
I don't want nobody else
I just want to see you grow
But I can't help if you won't help yourself
I just gotta let you know
I don't want nobody else
I just gotta let you go
'cause I can't help if you want help yourself

[Verse Two]
I have always told you that I'm happy being second best
To your baby girl but I ain't havin' your baby mumma's stress
Her childness
Her intent is obvious
And nigga the way you deal with her
You're fooling with my trust
Now boy it's really killing me
You don't have to say a word
I see the sorrow in your eyes
And in my soul I feel your hurt
I'm guessin' it's your pride that keeps your pain so deep inside
But it's stressin' questionin' how you feel and why you hide

[Chorus]",Gotta Let U Know
Ms. Dynamite,"The shit that you promote, fightin, fuckin, like you don't want 2 grow.
You talkin so much sex, but you nah tell the youts bout Aids and you tell them bout consequence, no!
You talkin like you a G, but you killer killing your own, your just a racist mans pussy.
Tell me who you wants 2 know, what, when, who, where or how you do your hoe.

Certainly not, me
Certainly not, me
'Cause baby personally, I like 2 be challenged mentally
I've heard it all before gangsters, pimps and whores
Quality is poor

A girl likes me needs more!

It Takes More 2 amuse a girl like me
So much more 2 confuse a girl like me
They got you, 'cause while you're braggin bout your badness your just
Avoidin, addin to the reel shit that's happening to us
Who gives a damn about the ice on your hand
If it's not 2 complex tell me how many Africans died for the buggettes on your rolex
So what you pushin a nice car, don't you know there ain't no such thing as superstars
We leave this world alone so who gives a fuck about the things you own

Certainly not, me
Certainly not, me
'Cause baby personally, I like 2 be challenged mentally
I've heard it all before gangsters, pimps and whores

Now I could sit and shit about how I sex
But my business is my business I got self respect
I could talk bout how my press could pimp man doe
Get the keys 2 his ride and his home
But I looked it up and that would make me a hoe
Little sisters now I really gotta let you know
Reel women ain't sexin 4 no mans doe
Reel women work hard 2 make they own
And we can all chat bout gats and blacks on blacks
Enforce the hypes and all be	 stereotypes
But youts are watchin that ain't what I'm here for

I lived life hiding behind the curtain
Never known 4 certain when I'd be free
I lived life as my shadow hopin' that the pain would go
But all the time I was hidin' from me

And so still u kept them near
Have u ever been untrue
Even though u knew right from wrong
But the coward in u just kept them hanging on
I ain't claimin' 2 b no angel
I really never meant 2 it just weren't meant 2 b
I knew he thought I was the one
The least that I could of done was made him

u need 2 remember how it felt b4 ur untrue

He don't love u
Never have I seen him kiss or hug u
He don't make effort he don't respect u or accept u 4 u
Tells u what 2 wear and how 2 behave
Comes in ur home and treats u like his slave
Don't need him if he make u sacrifice
Ur freedom get him out ur life
Shout and curse at u in public places
Sleep in ur house on a part time basis
He aint even takin' care of his child he don't make u smile.

I understand u love him and ur down
But that don't mean u got to b his clown

And this time don't take him back
Girl u got 2 put him out
Take the time 2 love urself

He don't even know how 2 be honest
All he know how 2 do is false promise
Any real man agree he ain't a man after the first
time that he raised his hand
Treat your home like hotel and don't pay his way
Lost count of the times that that dog has strayed
Sleep around creep around bring back disease
what if next time it was HIV
4 baby mummas, 8 kids and no work
U can play strong but I know that it hurt
U make the choices U gotta stop this 'cos
girlfriend the boy worthless

fool is far from that
Any boy can be a father that ain't reason
enough 2 keep on takin' him back
He never reads with her or takes her out that
shits called neglect u hear
Sure she confused and tired of always seeing
mummas face bruised and drownin' in tears
Look what u showin' her by lettin' him disrespect u
U just growin' her to think that it's something
that all men do
U owe it 2 urself and ur daughter cos she thinks
it's all alright
When she get older follow the footsteps u showed
her how u gonna look her in the eye

[Verse One (Kymani Marley):]
Yo,
Oh,
At first glance its like cupid hit,
Mesmorised by her thighs and her hips.
So, she went ahead and find a man wit' some chips,
And left school when she cop da whip.
Caught in the game,
Locked in the speedin' lane.
Livin a life for money, drugs and fame,
But true love is what she can't entertain.
And every chance she get she's given the blame.
Then she askin' why,
I told she was livin a lie.
When I told her she started to cry.
Don't just sit and let life pass you by,
And I slowly wiped the tears from her eyes.
[Chorus:]
I told her to take it slow,
Girl give it time to flow,
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow.
So many seeds on the street,
No sunshine but always heat.
And lives are lost at every heartbeat. 
I told her take it slow,
Girl give it time to flow,
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow.
So many seeds on the street,
No sunshine but always heat.
Drownin' in poverty and deceit,
But black roses grow from concrete.
[Verse Two (Ms Dynamite):]
He got a family to feed,
So every night he out on the street,
Shottin poison to young mothers and youths dem,
Coz he feel it the only way to keep his peeps on they feet,
Makes ends meet,
And gets his own up out of poverty.
Until one night,
He came home to find his mother cry,
she pointed to the floor and he saw a trail of his supply,
She led him to his room to find his brother on his bed,
Track marks, 
Needle in his arm and stone cold dead.
And suddenly, 
They all flashed before his eyes,
The kids that he sold to,
And they mothers cries. 
Every child is someones child 
You affa a mind what you do,
'cause Karma gunna bring the drama back on you.
Do what you gotta do,
But nigga when it comes to them youths,
There is no excuse,
Our future that,
We supposed to nurture that,
Nah lettin nuttin or nobody hurt that.
Do what you gotta do,
But nigga when it comes to them youths,

You claim you're doing God's work
Greet the family with a smile
When all the while
You been raping that child
You a priest but you still can't
Wash the blood from your hands.
The self hate they create in your hair
Got you pickin' up their weapons
And leaving your brothers there,
Tell me..
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?

[Chorus]
I wonder what you gon' do
When he comes for you
Where you gon' run
Once he calls for you
Where you gonna hide
The day he sends for you
And he questions you
I wonder what you gonna say
When that day comes
When judgement day comes

I'm talking bout the sins you commit
giving orders that permit,
Killing innocent kids so you can fill your pockets
Tell me how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
Now take a look at these project buildings
They got us living in
It's like we're raised in prison cos of the colour of our skin
Now how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
The pharmaceutical industry need to get paid
They're sitting on a cure
Watching new born babies die of AIDS
Tell me how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
How could you keep exploiting third world children
Using them as underpaid slaves
So you can make your millions
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?

[Repeat Chorus]

We sit and watch why people get hurt
Stand to say nothing while they do the devil's work
Walk straight by leave them crying in the dirt
What kind of people does that make me n you?
And we could have all the good intent
But we sitting in silence
We committing greed and violence
Then we got blood on our hands too

Tim took you from ghetto to class, how to hold your glass
To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash
People was seein' you pass, like right through the drapes
I brought you the private, ounce wit the gates

Thinkin' that stuff make me faint, just whistle real fast
Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag
Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for
It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour

And I'm deeply committed, although I'm forgettin'
Sometimes while hittin' it ,different names would slip
If I been wit a chick, check me miss
Your complexion switched, honey you been on trips

But you don't appreciate this, till your back in the Jetta
No iceberg you own, just Angelica's sweaters
If the steaks ain't T-Bone, you ain't properly fed
Hun tonight is bet burgers, no cheese on the bread
And I say

Razor blades to the rocks, even lied to the cops

Accountant lawyer and lover, I'm through dealin' wit suckers
Shuttin' and lockin' the door, bout to settle the score

They get loco, but you know I know the drilly

Hate women that want to be other women
Since they won I never fit in
I'm a rock the world with no games or gimmicks
Plan on winning ? limits
You hear it all in my sentence going
Shock up the world with something new and improved
Ain't stoppin I'm makin moves
No choices then I'm a choose
They can tell me to stop but it's obvious I'm gonna go
They say yes I say no you hear it all in my flow
This is young America steering you in your area, area
Do what I want and that's period
I get up and put on what I feel like putting on
When I don't blend in people look at me like something wrong
As if I'm crazy, strange, weird or throwed off
New chick driving fast in a old car
I'm still pimpin, still pimpin just tryna make a living
From the end to the beginning
It's a damn shame when you stick out thinking you insane
Rock everything from name brand to hand made
This is my life this is who I am I will not escape
Don't want a piece of the pie I just want a bigger plate
I'm just tryna live and watch how the plot thickens
Ain't no problem 'cause everybody's just a little different
Open your ears and eyes and make the world listen

People is gon stare gon hate gon talk
But never will they expose what they doing in the dark
If you don't give a shit but you know you got it together, fuck it
They gotta put you down to make they-self feel better
Black or white, dark brown or light
Short, thin and small, thick, big or tall
And I think it's a mess we judged on how we dress
How many cars we got, how many bitches we pop
If a nigga got girls then he considered the pro
But if a girl got niggas then she considered the ho
And if a white person hang around blacks he a wigga
And if a black person hang around whites he a nigga
And if we try to make it out the ghetto we a sell-out
Pressure gets so deep at times I want to yell out
This shit is crazy it's time we take a stand
Focus on ourselves and stop worrying about the next man
It's your prerogative tight pants are sagging
Can't please em all with a hotter poppin of has-beens
It's just the world we live in that amaze me
People claim they real but most of them must feel gazy
Quick to judge when they so artificial
Shit it's obvious I guess people just got some issues
Counterfeit and crazy, so shady
What else can I say; I'm just a different kinda lady

Me and my girls shrivel all over the world
Makin you stumble and hurl, braids ponytails and the curls
I got them folk pumpin and movin around
Jumpin and gettin it down, sweatin and workin it now

So set them bows tonight, engines gon' hum on the bikes

Concerned about who be in my sheets
You got beef with me? Then don't speak to me
Like how my flow different kinda pace
Garbage and the waste, ""please get out my face""
You want to taste? Miss me like I'm Mase
You want to taste? Like me William H.
I'm leavin y'all toothless like Gerome
rollin on the chromes, two ways and the phones
This Philly chick ain't wit this silly shit
Blunts and dutches licked, scrapin up for rent
Rat smugg-el-in, like the government
Keep 'em bub-bel-in, take it on the chin
So now they all duckin from the slugs

We keep it real, type of chicks we are
gettin nice at the bar, bang it loud in your car
I'm from the town, niggas gon' hold me down
Lost but now I'm found, watch me snatch the crown
I clear my throat, ladies spit what I wrote
takin off my coat, stuntin tryin to poke
We in the back, countin and peelin the stacks
combin and brushin the tracks--y'all can't hold me back

Masculine puff and then pass, if your feelin in Philly then dance

You chastize
But can't stop my enterprise

Put your raps in a stack

On you this tight thing
Space nine enferno
One verbs be frightening
And for the sword fights tonight

Remove your mask
Let down your visage
But don't slip up
Cause when I was in my ship
That's when I get ripped up

Melt down, now up in pot

Big dreams and hurt feelings
Call me Jade the Champ
I put the weight on my shoulders where other bitches slack
Who else you know can breath life into a murdered track?
I done see what y'all can do, nevermind that
Like the old mixed with the new, like a Philly throwback
Take your best shots, I promise I'ma throw back
We can take it back to the days of the cadillac
Jumps out
And handle that
Heat melts your candle wax
Maybes and matter facts, Ms. Jade's the fucking champ
Play the low and kill you softly like Roberta Flack
And then they, And then they mad 'cause I'm stating facts
And then they, And then they hate when I cop the cat
That old nursery rhyming this shit ain't about that
My flow I mix between one-eighty proof and six packs
Spit circles around you, see if you could get back
Before you jump best know exactly who you getting at

A lot of squads is out, but Tim, he got the
And we ain't worried at all cause y'all pretty wack
I been bending and cracking tracks, call me Jade the Champ
See it coming, eyes in back
Blaze up a twenty sack
y'all need team participation, what's really up with that?
And so they, and so they, drill when you getting stacks
But they don't know shit until it's sitting in they lap
They handle it in more ways, make 'em holla back
In the ring with the thing thing, make me twist your cap
You fools is selling your soul for a little plaque
Let's take it back to the hood where niggas is shooting craps
And everybody rapping, we ain't do it for the stacks
I bet they really really pissed cause they knowing that
The robe is crested and steamed and is nicely packed
Clubs in the backpack, lights off, that's that

But Ima do exactly what them losers said I can't
Gotta stay on my toes and I ain't afraid of that
You niggas pimp on, I leave you where your gators at
This is for every person that I owe, I'm paying back
And every nigga turned groupie, I know you heard of that
People that smiled in my face and talked behind my back
For every dream that got lost, I promise I'm winning back
To all my peoples that knocked, we gone bounce back
And all the babies in the hood, gotta announce that
I can't give up, I won't give up, I crown myself the champ
So I don't think y'all want to see me when I'm really amped
Ain't no stopping me, I'm a long way from breaking man
I'm Ms. Jade, bout to show you how to take a chance
Corner full of rappers, show you how to take a man
A squad full of thugs, show you how to break a man

Ms. Jade,"[ad-libs: Timbaland]
Yo, what I need right here..
Is my ladies on one side..
And my fellas on one side..
This goes out to all the ghetto clubs..
And this how we gone put it down..
BEEEAAATTT CLUUUBBB!! OHH!

[Verse One]
Who the hell want to test me? Big guns and things
See me in the SOURCE book, big frozen rings
Never been a follower, always been a leader
y'all to meet us, get down on ya knees when you greet her
I'm a gangsta, see me in the ball wit my niggas
Rowdy lil' dudes ain't afraid to pull triggas
Get shit crunk, I'm a fuckin' icon
Niggas in the street whisperin' about mine, why?
Cause I'm.. the broad from the East
Smellin' like Gucci, Fendi linen pants wit the crease, huh
You want a piece? I don't think ya half-ready
See fifty-five, but I used to push the Chevy
Fuck up tracks, but y'all just rap
Never touch pape, most of y'all just act
Heidi-flights, pimp rap, must tell y'all the truth
I get it in, but y'all mess around in the booth
What the fuck, y'all suck, come at all y'all smuts
Poppin' up worldwide, everywhere like Starbucks
What the fuck, y'all suck come at all y'all smuts
Poppin' up worldwide, everywhere like Starbucks

[Chorus]
She's a gangsta
Not a pranksta, y'all
Not a follower
But a leader, y'all, feel that
She's a gangsta girl
She's a gangsta girl
Now can ya feel that?
She's a gangsta girl
She's a gangsta girl

[Verse Two]
I got the sickest, rolled me a big spliff
Crazy when the mic palmed in my black fist
You do it like you, I do it like this
Ms. Jade, power food and project piss
Now, how y'all want to play? Spit it for the big pay
I leave that ass Up In Smoke like Eminem and Dre
Semi or the AK, do this shit the Philly way
We ball out to Hamptons just to get away
Best 'bout time we settle this
Up in the club, throwin' bows, actin' ghetto-ish
And if I stop, I'm a still be a rebel chick
Have you fuckas duckin' quick, puffin' in a tinted whip 
Beat the case like Puffy did, legend-style like 'Pac and Big
When I'm gone, trust me, I'm a still live
Take, but I'd rather get you fuckin' wit the bigger kids
Bigger ones, bigger funds
Bigger fleece, Timbaland, bigger beats..

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Cruisin' down 95 wit a cup in my hand
Hot throws, large bills tucked up in a rubberband
Got the aimed amount, won't let 'em burn me out
Cause I'm a strong black woman, yup, grown black woman
Gangs, do I really play? Nine-to-five barely pay
Pounds of the green shit, never fuck wit the trays
I don't care if it bothers you, I'm still gone blaze
So sick like a virus that never goes away, hey
Hold ya breathe, you can smell the success
Spit sixteen off the pit pattin' ya chest
Yes, I'm so blessed, y'all cats is so stressed
Yeah, the streets been talkin' but my pen'll do the rest
Future mapped out, money linked all in
I'm a saturate the game, then sink y'all in
Snakes, fakes, and dick riders, what I dispise
Out to take it all over and will not compromise

(Intro)
Ms. Jade's the name comin to ruin the game (Do It) (repeat 3)

(Verse 1)
I got a master plan knocking these bum broads outta my way
Just came in the door and they got somethin to say
Tell em step up if they want to act hard
I don't need no great big bodyguard
Only dump dimes when it's time to blaze the L
You can do it just as long as you don't hurt ya self
Pull up, hop out start spitting like the A.R.
1-5 cake or sky high oh my
Got the science and the formula for hatin chicks
And whatcha do, if you don't like me you can suck a dick
I'm smoother then a pair of lizard skins in '88
A lotta suckas portrayin us when we know they ain't
Get the fuck outta here your dealin with a rider here
The chef in hell's kitchen, I'm stayin here for  alotta years
And for my thugs, real bitches and all my hustlers
Keep it movin I ain't got no paitence for you bustas (DO IT)

(Chorus paraphrasing Audio Two)
Step up if you want to get hurt
Ms. Jade's gonna pull your skirt (oh)
Step up if you want to get hurt
Ms. Jade's gonna pull your skirt (DO IT,OH)
Step up if you want to get hurt
Ms. Jade's gonna pull your skirt (OH)
I am chillin (OH), we is chillin (OH), what else can we say? TOP BILLIN

(Verse 2)
Now I don't mean to be rude cocky and arrogant
I Guess that's just the PHILLY in me, and I don't even care
I Guess that's just the PHILLY in me, and I ain't even scared
This rap game is a war and I done came prepared
It ain't nothin to me to just pack up and leave
but why shouldn't I give it every breath that I breathe
And why shouldn't I kill it every time that I leave
When these fake mutha fucka's is so easy to read 'cause
My family got needs, my city need me
So I'mma do it from the muscle bitch believe me
Think 'cause I'm with Tim that I got it easy
but that don't stop me from smoking up in the Crown V
Stayin sucka free, weed in the truck with me
This music biz keep a bitch puffin heavily
3 in the mornin listening to Frankie Beverly
I won't stop till the whole world lovin me (DO IT)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
You can Cha Cha Cha to this mardi gras
I'm the sickest rap bitch you done heard thus far
And it will get be-tta I'm bout my che-dda
and no one gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing whether 2003 swing
or I'm poppin that thing thing and lockin the game mane
won't fuck up my game plan, dealin the same hand
Just getting started and I'm only getting hotta mane
So getcha feet into the heat start lurkin
A dollar or a million I'mma be the same person
Ms. Jade bout to take this shit
And even if I'm through with ya'll couldnt catch my twist (DO IT)

Because I've been there once or twice

You need someone who's older
A rub down with a velvet glove
There is nothing you can take
To relieve that pleasant ache

Usually I'm in the house but today I snuck home
And when I walk down the Long Beach streets, what a lesson they taught
While walkin to the cornerstore a big mistake was made
My big homey I was walkin with decided he needed to get paid

So he loaded up his .32 and walked right in the store
He said ""Dear God, forgive me please but I can't be broke no more""

ireland is at war with herself
Hopeless that I couldn't help
When ireland is at war with herself
My heart was strong but I was wrong
To think that I could save her
Her head was mixed in politics
And I fell out of favor
There was no trial
No mercy mild
And now I am forever exiled
Ireland is at war with herself
All the time I spent in ireland
She never gave a hint of discontent
We used to run through the fields hand in hand
I was her little boy I was her somewhat bigger man
I pledged my loyalty
I was her patriot
I was her everything that she'd soon forget

Hopeless cause I couldn't help

tell me all about your neighbor
Tell me something I don't know

I don't have to measure

And his arms are large
And my arms are skinny
I really fear your neighbor
He probably owns a gun
But doesn't need it
He could squash me like a bug
And fix your car at the same time
I just lost you to your neighbor
But I don't think that he's your type

And the mountains in reply
Echoing their sweet refrain.

MU330,"I heard the bells on Christmas day,
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.

I thought how, as the time goes by,
The bells keep ringing day and night.
They rolled along, unbroken song
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.

And in despair I bowed my head,
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.""
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep,
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, goodwill to men.""

Till ringing, singing on its way,
The world revolved from night to day.
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime:
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.

Solid together.

Holdin' hands, walkin' through the puddles,
How could things get so muddled?

And I'm searching for tomorrow but I know My life is in your hands
Had my future laid out
The next few years all played out in my head
But I am just a man
Here I stand with no plans before me
So here I am, submitting full control
I can't stand not knowing what's before me
So here I am, playing my role
I'm not used to giving up control

Writing to you now because 
I haven't seen you in so long
Even though we live in the same home
You're the father that I've never known
I get up each day, you're already gone
Drive past your office late at night
And see the light still on
Why do you care more about your job
Than about the family falling apart?
Don't even know you
Can't understand you
Never stopped to think of anyone else

Hello, my boy, your letter hurt me so
18 years I've worked so hard, 
While I missed seeing you grow
I was just trying to provide for you
All my efforts thrown back in my face
Every morning I say a prayer for you
As I lose another day making it the best for you
Someday you'll wake up and you'll realize
And you'll thank me for how hard I tried
It's always been about you
But I'm a person too
I feel like giving up
I've had about enough
I gave up more for you 
Than you'll ever understand
But you were never there for me

Son, I always tried to give you 
All the things I never had
But all I ever wanted was a dad",Father & Son

'Cause I'm miserable again
I don't understand how any of this 
Makes me a better man

You know I always run to you 
For some help with my life
You know I always come to you 
For a little wise advice

And all I get is pain
Okay, so I'm exaggerating,
I'm just saying that's how it seems to me
If all good things come to an end, 

Then what about the bad?
Am I cursed to never see the fruits 
Of the life I wish I had?
And can I try, one more time, 

To be pleasing to you?
My futile efforts never seem 
To make my wish come true
What can I do?

I'll follow through with all these claims 
I never cease to make
A promise to myself 
Is one I promise to break

But when I have you by my side 
Then I can do what's right
I'll become the co-pilot 
And you control this flight

Then everything will be alright

A reminder of how I intend my life to be
Every word I sing

Is an anthem against my own hypocrisy?

now all at once I find you're really mine.
I must be dreaming
when you say that you're in love with me.

The way that I feel
is so heavenly, too good to be real.
When you're next to me I'm so afraid
that I'm fast asleep so don't wake me up,
let me dream if I'm dreaming.

There was a knock on the door

A thump on the floor and the party turned insane

she's got she's got the whole town lighting up dynamite

Muddy Waters,"Alright, alright.
Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen right here, 
Right here I want to tell you a little story.
This is about a country boy from down home.
This young man has never been north before.
I want you to listen to me, I got something to tell
You.

He heard about Chicago.
He worked hard over here, made all of that money, 800
Dollars.
After caring for his crop, he called his cousin in
Chicago, 
And he said, ""Cousin, I'm on my way"".
He picked all of that cotton.
I said this is about a country boy like myself, B.B.
King you know.
So when he get to Chicago, his cousin meet him and
Bring him out to the club.
He said, ""Set him up!"", cous's payin' for.
Had all the go-go girls set up, waitin' up.
They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the
Pleasure hotels.
They brought him back out and said, ""Set him up!"", 
Cous's payin' for.
His money got a little lighter, they lured him out from
The Lute and brought him down to Robert's.
And then he said, ""Set him up!"", cous's payin' for.
And then the 800 dollars, bein' more money then my man
Had ever had, began to run out.
Then they moved him out and put him down with the... 
And then, ladies and gentlemen, the go-go girls would
Get fewer.
His friends was fewer.
All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other
Side of the street.
And then it happened all his buddies were gone.
And my man knew only one thing to do, it was getting
Cold there, like it is today, 
You know what I'm talking about.
He went down to the railroad yard, 
And one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent
His money, came by to see him.
And she said ""You fool!, you fool!"", I wouldn't have
Spend your money, but the rest of them was spending
Your money so I decided to spend my portion too, you
Know.
But ladies, God bless 'em, wonderful something's aren't
They?.
They always like to feel like they're needed, and she
Knew my man needed her bad.
He gotten sick, he's layin' down there under the
Boxcar.
Couldn't read so well, so you know if he couldn't read
So well, he couldn't write too well, 
You know what I'm talkin' about?
So this is a letter back down home, I know what I'm
Talkin' about.
It go like this:

I've had my fun, whoah, if I don't get well no more
Whoah, I've had my fun, people, ooh, if I don't get
Well no more
Yes, my health is faillin' on me now, people

I'm in
Ooh yes, tell my people, mother, tell her the shape I'm
In
