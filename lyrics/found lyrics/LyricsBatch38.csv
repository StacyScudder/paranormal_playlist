Dan Estes,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Dan Faulk,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars
Dan Ferrari,"Can you blame me
For still having thoughts about you and I
Call me crazy
But it?s hard to let go when we never really said goodbye

Did you shake me
Are you just killing time with him
Did you erase me
Or do you still wonder what might have been
Cause I still wonder
I still wonder

What a story line we made
But we put a bookmark in the page
And we said we?d pick it up another day
With chapters still left to be told
You?ve found someone new to hold
How are you not curious to know how the rest of our story goes

Do you remember
Endless nights at the jersey shore
Do you ever
Wish for just one more afternoon in bed til four
Do you still wonder
Cause I still wonder

What a story line we made
But we put a bookmark in the page
And we said we?d pick it up another day
With chapters still left to be told
You?ve found someone new to hold
How are you not curious to know how the rest of our story goes

Why can?t we just pick things up where we left off
Like we said we would
Would we have let each other go
If we new back then it would be for good

What a story line we made
But we put a bookmark in the page
And we said we?d pick it up another day
With chapter?s still left to be told
You?ve found someone new to hold
How are you not curious to know how the rest of our story goes

Dan Ferrari,"I?m tired and my head aches like hell tonight
Been thinking way too much
I guess you?ve found a way to justify
Walking out and losing touch
All this waiting
Nothing changing

I guess I would have heard from you by now 
If you really cared for me
You would have finally come around
Guess that?s not meant to be
I got a long list of things I need to do before I die
And I can?t wait for you
I would have heard from you by now
If you were gonna be a part of my life

You were there the day I learned to crawl
And I was there to watch you go
Tell me how someone so close to me
Turns into someone I don?t know
And all you left me was my last memory

I guess I would have heard from you by now if you really cared for me
You would have finally come around
Guess that?s not meant to be
I got a long list of things I need to do before I die
And I can?t wait for you
I would have heard from you by now
If you were gonna be a part of my life

I could have used the extra hands to come and pick me up
It would be much easier to stand if you?d just lift me up
I know its not because you can?t
You just don?t care enough
To tell me why should I

I guess I would have heard from you by now if you really cared for me
You would have finally come around
Guess that?s not meant to be
I got a long list of things I need to do before I die
And I can?t wait for you
I would have heard from you by now
If you were gonna be a part of my life

Dan Fogel,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me
Dan Fogelberg,"So you've heard I've been flyin'
And tryin' to get into
Somebody new
And I'm off on a new love
And don't hardly ever
Think about you.

He's gotten so cold
He ain't the same old
Lover you used to know.
He's in a nose dive
Barely half alive
And just about to let go.

Someone's been telling you stories
Someone's been telling you stories
Someone's been telling you stories
And they just ain't true
No, they just ain't true.

So you heard I got laid
And betrayed by a maid in a one night stand
And I'm caught in the middle of something I don't really understand.
He's gotten so lost
He's been double-crossed
By a change in the wind.

He's gone solo again
And he can't slow down now
To pick up a friend.
Someone's been telling you stories
Someone's been telling you stories

And they just ain't true
No, they just ain't true

Dan Fogelberg,"I see the raven's made
Her nest in your eyes
She's got you thinking that
Her love is a prize
And you'll go under from
The weight of her lies
As the raven flies
As the raven flies

She'll bring you stories
That just never sound true
She'll bring you secrets
That were never meant for you,
And just as you come round
She'll send you back through
She's in love with you
She's in love with you.

Darker, darker
Don't let her talk her way
Into you.
Lonely, lonely
You know she's only
No good for you.

Dan Fogelberg,"Changing horses in the middle of a stream
Gets you wet and sometimes cold
Changing faces in the middle of a dream
Gets you old
Oh, gets you old.

Looking farther than you'll ever hope to see
Takes you places you don't know
Search for someone you can't ever hope to be
And still you go
Oh, still you go.

Don't you think it's kind of sad to say,
Don't you think it's gonna change?
Makes you think you'll have to stay inside
For a while.

Dan Fogelberg,"Dusty day dawning
Three hours late
Open the curtains

This lamb has got to
Return to the fold.

Have to see me again
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again

Flat on the prairies

We went the long way
We went the long way...

Overnight
We were shown the light

Dan Fogelberg,"You and I were lovers all along
We had a good thing going strong
And never doubted.
Lately, I feel changes comin' on
I know that I will soon be gone
And you don't even want
To talk about it.

Oh, and it makes me stop and
Wonder why
People give their hearts and turn
around and say goodbye
If there's something on your mind
You better say it while there's time
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that
Morning sky.

Oh, how did we ever come to this?
There's nothing for me in your kisses anymore.
Late nights in the kitchen
I'm pretending I still care
But we both know there's nothing there

Dan Fogelberg,"I have these moments
All steady and strong
I'm feeling so holy and humble
The next thing I know
I'm all worried and weak
And I feel myself starting to crumble

The meanings get lost
And the teachings get tossed
And you don't know what
You're going to do next
You wait for the sun
But it never quite comes
Some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message comes through

And it says to you. . .

Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival
And one day we'll all understand

I had a woman
Who gave me her soul
But I wasn't ready to take it
Her heart was so fragile
And heavy to hold
And I was afraid I might break it

Your conscience awakes
And you see your mistakes
And you wish someone
Would buy your confessions
The days miss their mark
And the night gets so dark
And some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message shoots through --

Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival
And one day we'll all understand

There is no Eden or
Heavenly gates
That you're gonna make it to one day
But all of the answers you seek
Can be found
In the dreams that you dream on the way",Part of the Plan
Dan Fogelberg,"Now the wind is still
In a moment it will be raging
Now my soul is young
In a moment it will be aging.
And high above the pines
I wrote several lines
And left them in a bottle
For you to find.

Now the dream is rising
In a moment it will be past
This breath is my first
It will all too soon be my last.

And on a windy coast
I made several toasts
To you and me and the sea

Dan Fogelberg,"Here is a poem
That my lady sent down
Some morning while
I was away.
Wrote on the back of
A leaf that she found
Somewhere around Monterey.

And here is the key
To a house far away
Where I used to live
As a child.
They tore down the building
When I moved away
And left the key unreconciled.

And down in the canyon
The smoke starts to rise.
It rides on the wind
Till it reaches your eyes.
When faced with the past
The strongest man cries...cries.

Some say she died of a sudden start

Some say they found her swinging from my old man's tree 
And some folks say she died of a broken heart 
And some folks say she died of a broken heart

I chased but never thought I'd catch you
You said you loved me but you had to be free and I let you
Why did I let you
We walked together through the gardens and graves
I watched you grow to be a woman
Living on promises that nobody gave to no one
They were given to no one
I started listening to the wind and the rain
You strained your ears but could hear nothing
One night I thought I heard them whisper my name
And I went running
I left a trail of footprints deep in the snow
I swore one day I would retrace them
But when I turned around I found that the wind had erased them
Now I'll never replace them

[Chorus:]
Fly away, my sweet bird, over the land
Take life for all the freedom you can
But if you ever should need a man
Well, the offer still stands
I hear you've taken on a husband and child
And live somewhere in Pennsylvania
I never thought you'd ever sever the string but I can't blame you none
So let the ashes fall and lay where they will
Just say that once you used to know me
One last time sing that old song we used to know
But this time sing
But this time sing a little more slowly

Worth the price of the pain?
Are the spoils worth the cost of the hunt?

Or else you`ll learn them all over again
Or else you`ll have to learn them

Dan Fogelberg,"Climbing a mountain
In darkness
Stranded alone on the ledge.
Every attempt that I make to hold on
Pushes me nearer the edge.

My thoughts are diffused by despair
I feel like I'm swimming straight up
Underwater
Desperately racing for air
I'm racing for air.

And the chords struck at birth
Grow more distant
Yet, we strike them again and again.
And we plead and we pray
For a glimmer of day
As the night folds its wings
And descends
Exposing the loose ends.

Surrounding myself with possessions
I surely have more than I need
I don't know if this is justice, hard earned,
Or simply a matter of greed

Dan Fogelberg,"High on this mountain
The clouds down below
I'm feeling so strong and alive
From this rocky perch
I'll continue to search
For the wind
And the snow
And the sky

I want a lover
I want some friends
And I want to live in the sun
And I want to do all the things that I
Never have done.

Sunny bright mornings
And pale moonlit nights
Keep me from feeling alone
Now, I'm learning to fly
And this freedom is like
Nothing that I've ever known
I've seen the bottom
And I've been on top
But mostly I've lived in between
And where do you go
When you get to the end of
Your dream?

Off in the nether lands
I heard a sound
Like the beating of heavenly wings
And deep in my brain
I can hear a refrain
Of my soul as she rises and sings
Anthems to glory and
Anthems to love and
Hymns filled with early delight
Like the songs that the darkness
Composes to worship the light.

Once in a vision
I came on some woods
And stood at a fork in the road
My choices were clear
Yet I froze with the fear
Of not knowing which way to go.

One road was simple
Acceptance of life
The other road offered sweet peace
When I made my decision
My vision became my release.",Nether Lands

Dan Fogelberg,"I was born by a river
Rolling past a town
Given no direction
Just told to keep my head down
As I took my position
A man fired a gun
I was so steeped in tradition
That I could not run
I was raised by a river
Weaned upon the sky
And in the mirror of the waters
I saw myself learn to cry
As my tears hit the surface
I saw what had been done
I gave feet to my freedom
And I did run
Someday later
I saw the writing in the dust
It told me how I should travel
It told me who I was
I ran far from the river
Far as I could see
And as the sun hit my shoulders
I felt it burning me
How I longed for the waters
As the fire raged
How I longed for the river
As I aged
I will die by a river
As it rolls away
Bury me in the nighttime
Do not waste the day
High above the waters
That roll on to the sea
All the angels in heaven 
Will laugh at me
They will laugh at me

Rolling through my brain
Made of so many teardrops
Made of so much pain",The River

Let it soak me down
Before I called you . . . I called

Mirror on the wall
Dreaming that the looking glass was me
Catching your fondest gazes
Living through your fickle phases
I love you

And it's getting easier each day
To weep about you
Harder every night to sleep without you
How many years must I be driven
By this dream
Of love with you?

Spend my dimes on phones
Trying just to talk but
You don't answer . . . you let it ring

Spend my nights alone
Catching falling stars to
Give to you, love
They're just for you

For stars fall every time a
Lover has to face the truth
And far too many stars have fell on me
And as they trail the skies
And burn their paths upon my eyes

And lead to his weary journey's end, his journey's end 
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing 
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days 
We run on and on without a backwards glance 
We run on and on without a backwards glance 
I cast my fate with the wife of Lot I turned my gaze around 
Knowing neither what I sought nor what was to be found 
Heeding weakness, feeding strength, oh life at length is frail 
I seek again the river's source through time's dark shadowed veil 
In the fast fading century, as we spin through the years 
I pray that our failing vision clears, our vision clears 
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing 
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days

We run on and on without a backwards glance

Hiding 'neath the murky banks of long forgotten streams

And through the eyes of someone else I look in to my face
And can't believe the sorrow there I see
I can't believe this lonely man is me

The faster we run
The further away the dreams that we chase become
Lost in the sun
Spinning and turning, blind in the burning
Light of day, we have to turn away

Every night I ask myself that same old question why
And every day the answer seems more distant
I always knew the final truths lay just beneath the lies
But I never thought they'd take this long to find
I never thought they'd be this hard to find

The faster we run
The further away the dreams that we chase become
Lost in the sun
Spinning and turning, blind in the burning
Light of day, we have to turn away

Dan Fogelberg,"Dawn...like an angel
Lights on the step
Muting the morning she heralds
Dew on the grass
Like the tears the night wept
Gone long before
The day wears old.

Times stills the singing
A child holds so dear
And I`m just beginning to hear
Gone are the pathways
The child followed home
Gone, like the sand and the foam.

Pressed in the pages
Of some aging text
Lies an old lily, crumbling
Marking a moment
Of childish respects
Long since betrayed and forgotten.

Dan Fogelberg,"Every time we speak, our words betray intentions
Insincere inventions that never quite reach the heart
So we turn the other cheek and gather our defenses
Again rebuild the fences that just been keeping us apart

Waiting out the worst, we keep the best inside us
In hopes our hearts can hide us, in hopes our tears don't show
And you know we're not the first to try and breach the distance
And though we meet resistance the love between us grows

And in the time it takes us to look beyond the lies
We could be sailing through each other's eyes
And in those stolen moments when love is caught off guard
We see it never had to be this hard

Well, maybe so
There's still a lot of things 
You'll never know
Like why each time 
The sky begins to snow
You cry

You're faithful to her
In your careless way
So you miss her when 
She's far away
But every time you think 
You've got it straight
You fall 

You face the future 
With a weary past

Are fading fast

But it may not last

And it's never clear

And who's to steer

Roll up the carpets and pull in the blinds 
And retreat to the chambers that I left behind 
In hopes there still may be love left to find

Seek inspiration in daily affairs

And the voices you hear at the top of the stairs 
Are only echoes of unanswered prayers

Dan Fogelberg,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

When precious flesh is greedily consumed

Dan Fogelberg,"Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stood behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

We took her groceries to the check out stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation lagged

We went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

She said she's married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie

I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw
Doubt or gratitude

She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was Hell

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving, in our eloquence
Another ""Auld Lang Syne""

The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away

Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And, as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain",Same Old Lang Syne

Rising in the heat like a
Mirage
Tony keeps his Chevy
Like a virgin locked in
His garage
He brings it out at midnight
And cruises down the
Empty boulevards
And he prowls the
Darkened alleys
That snake between the city`s
Thirsty yards
The lonely desert skies reflect
The anger in his eyes
And it is dawn.

His father died of drinking
And left five children sinking
With his mom
His older brother Bobby
Never made it back from Viet Nam
With high school well behind him
He lives at home and works this
Shitty job.

And he thinks his '60 Chevy
Is the only true amigo
That he's got
His heart is filled with sadness
And his soul is like some
Ugly vacant lot.

Mary Estelle Hanna
Came out from Louisiana
For the sun
A deal gone bad in Dallas
Left her burned and broke
And on the run
To make the rent and groceries
She takes this job at
$3.15 an hour
Serving shots of whiskey
And tequila
In some smoky red-neck bar
And she dreams some day
She`ll make her way to L.A.
And become a movie star.

Tony saw her working
He swallowed hard and asked
Her for a date
Mary laughed and answered
""I would but every night
I`m working late""
He said he had some cocaine
That she could have if she`d
Just ride along
She said ""What the hell,
I may a well
I haven`t had no fun in
So damn long""
He picked her up at closing time
They pulled out on the road
And they were gone.

Tony`s mom got frantic
When she found her son had
Not come home
Mary`s roommate panicked
And called the sheriff from
A public phone
They asked her lots of questions
She tried her best to tell
Them what she saw.

And late that night
They found poor Mary
Lying in some narrow,
Dusty draw
And the coroner reported
That she hadn`t been
Deceased for very long.

Two weeks on they found it
Buried to the windshield
In the sand
There inside lay Tony
With a small revolver in
His hand
The papers simply stated
It must have been the
Drugs that drove him mad
The neighbors speculated
What could make a good boy
Go so bad?
Well, it might have been
The desert heat
It might have been the
Home he never had.","Tucson, Arizona (Gazette)"

And judging from your grin, you`d think you held up Henry Ford.
And I don`t believe I want you a comin` `round here anymore. Ooh.""

Jesse, he was hurt, boy, and he left there, and he slammed the door.
And he wandered through the alleyways.
Thinkin` all the while that she`d be proud of what he stole for her,
And he tried to think of better ways.
Dreamin` of a movie that he`d seen one afternoon,
He drew out all his savings and he went and bought a gun.
And he ran right home and stood before his mirror
Acting like a thug, ooh.

He waited for a dark night; he was frightened, boy, the fog rolled in,
As a rich man, he came walkin` by,
""Hold your hands up high,"" he cried,
""I`ve come to make your fortune mine.""
But his eyes, they gave him right away,
Jesse dropped the gun and they both stared at to where it lay.
And Jesse asked the man if he`d please leave him in his pain.
And the man tried to forgive him, but there`s not much he could say. Ooh.

Among the possessions of an outlaw of a low class kind
Is this little bottle of French perfume
Taken as a last thought from a drugstore in suburbia.
He said, ""Lady, look what I`ve got for you.""
""Ah, take it, ah, please take it; I`m tired and I`m poor.
And this crappy French perfume is nothin` less than my own soul.
I was feelin` half a man; I wanted to feel whole, ooh.""

Dan Fogelberg,"Shallow rivers run between us
Where a stone may never sink.
Though we taste, we are left thirsty
For a deep and soulful drink.

Narrow channels, barely open
Fraught with dangers out of view;
In the current, we are helpless
Still I cling to you.

Grab me woman, take me under,
Till I can`t tell up from down.
We have barely got our feet wet
and I want, I want to drown.

Up ahead the water quickens;

Dan Fogelberg,"In the Spring of Forty-seven,
So the story, it is told,
Old John Sutter went to the mill site
Found a piece of shining gold.

Well, he took it to the city
Where the word, like wildfire, spread.
And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd
Left that stone in the river bed.

For they came like herds of locusts
Every woman, child and man
In their lumbering Conestogas
They left their tracks upon the land.

[Chorus]
Some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.

Well, they came from New York City,
And they came from Alabam'
With their dreams of finding fortunes
In this wild unsettled land.

Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows
As they tried to cross the plains.
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains
With their hands froze to the reins.

Oh...

[Chorus]

Well, some pushed on to California
And others stopped to take their rest.
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty
They had opened up the west.

And then the railroad came behind them
And the land was plowed and tamed,
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker,
He'd not one penny to his name.

Am I not the only one?
After all this pain and sorrow,
Darlin', think of what you've done.

Lovin' you has been my life, love

Where the mountains meet the sky.

But I just couldn't go on living on the brink

I guess you gotta get away.

Were the two that would defy the fickle gods
And win out against the odds and go on forevermore

But now that your heart has turned away
I must try to find a way to let you go
Even though I know you will never leave me

Cause you were my life's one great romance
And I will always see you dancing through my dreams
And as hopeless as it seems, I will always love you

Let the final curtain fall on us at last
And just put it in the past and say our last farewell

Was like meeting for the first time
In a foggy dream so many years ago.
Strangers in an airport
Searching for a word to break the ice.
Holding you again
Even for the briefest moment
Made me realize how much I love you still
Wanting you to want me
Still not knowing if you ever will.

Seeing you again
Seeing you again
Was the sweetest torture
I may ever know.
Seeing you again

Made me wish 
I'd never let you go.

Running free along the beaches
Where our shadows first
Began to intertwine
Listening to your laughter
Wishing that you love could still be mine.

Seeing you again

Was the sweetest torture
I may ever know.
Seeing you again
Seeing you again
Made me wish 
I'd never let you go.

Did you only come to say
You're sorry
Or give it one more try
Or did you only need to see
There was nothing left for me
Inside worth saving.
Running for your train
You smiled back through the doorway
Like you used to
When our hearts still beat as one
And as I turned away
I knew the lonely days had just begun.

Was the sweetest torture
I may ever know.

You can never read it in her eyes
And in her laughter there's no hint of compromise.

You can squeeze a stone until it bleeds
But you will never find the kind of love she needs.

And crossed the North Atlantic
When this century was young
They'd heard that in America
Every man was free
To live the way he chose to live
And be who he could be

Some of them were farmers there
And tilled the frozen soil
But all they got was poverty
For all their earnest toil

And the heather covered hills
And came to find America

And iron wills

My grandad worked the steel mills
Of central Illinois
His daughter was his jewel
His son was just his boy
For thirty years he worked the mills
And stoked the coke-fed fires
And looked toward the day
When he'd at last turn 65
And could retire

And the sons become the fathers
And the daughters will be wives
As the torch is passed from hand to hand

And sings this song to you

That so few ever find
Though the map's in your soul
And the road's in your mind

So many mountains before us
So many rivers to cross
Where is the wisdom to bring
Back the vision we've lost

Can we gaze with wonder of children
Into the deafening night 
Has it gotten so dark
That we cannot remember the light?

When you sleep on the ground
With the stars in your face
You can feel the full length
Of the beauty and grace
In the wild places man
Is an unwelcome guest
But it's here than I'm found
And it's here I feel blessed

Dan Fogelberg,"Well I got a lover and I got a friend
She says that she will love me, until the very end
She knows that she's my baby, she knows she's my very best friend
And when I'm down and broken, well she make me whole again

All I want to do, all I want to do, all I want to do
Is to love her, is to love that girl over and over again

She knows when I am tired and she knows just what to do
She kiss me oh so tender and hold me oh so tight
She wraps her arms around me and she make everything alright

Trouble stalks this one horse town
Like it can smell the fear inside of it

Mixing juices 'til they disengage
Mouths get hungry and the hands reach out
Is there something we should talk about

We've got to head for higher ground
Good people there's hard choices going down now
We've got to head for higher ground
Head for higher ground, higher ground

Shattered trusts and broken vows
Can exact a heavy toll
And in the race of heart and mind
Sure, the loser is the soul

We've got to head for higher ground
Good people there's hard choices going down now
We've got to head for higher ground
Head for higher ground, higher ground

Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher

All men are guilty of their brothers' crimes
So few are chosen, there's even fewer called
So few can ever read the writing on the wall

Running in a field of brown, laughing, rolling on the ground now
Smiling as she pulls you down

That's the way she feels about you
If your dreams should wake you shaking in the night
She can touch your face and take away all fright
Like a tree in a meadow wind she will bend to take you in
Makes no difference where you been
That's the way she feels about you

If you wake up screaming, scared about what you're dreaming
You know she is there, she can share

I saw her first in a beggar's game
Her eyes were wild but her laugh was tame.
Those people knew her by another name.
I knew that she'd be mine,
I knew that she'd be mine.

She took me in on a winter's night
The air was brittle and the moon was bright.
My heart was heavy but her touch was light.
Deep in the dance we wandered,
Deep in my heart she fell.

The candles glistened and the water gleamed.
She drew a bath and the windows steamed;
She looked like every woman ever dreamed,
In the heart of a lonely man,
In the heart of a lonely man.

She took my blindness and she led me through,
As night retreated and the daylight grew.
And with the first rays of the sun I knew,
Love had another captive,
Love had another fool.

[Chorus]

The spell is broken and the chains fall free.
Finally my heart has come home to me.
It seems I've waited an eternity.

She took me in on a winter's night,
The air was brittle and the moon was bright.
My heart was heavy but her touch was light.

Deep in the dance we wandered,
Deep in my heart she fell.

Dan Fogelberg,"Waiting in the wings your courage sings 
Before you falter
It's just another way to say
What's there but never shows

It's just another day to lay
Your sins before the altar
And where it's going to end
This time around nobody knows

Every time it seems 
That you have gained an understanding
Those devils at your heels
Reach up and try to tip the scales

Waking from a dream
You see it's all been
Done without you
And every vain attempt to make it stay
Is destined to fail

Fury rages through your restless days
Shades of time that's gone before
Empty cages where the prisoner plays
'Til the door swings closed behind for evermore

Evermore
Evermore

Long before we come of age 
We yearn to leave the garden
And wrestle with a myth
The hand of fate has faintly drawn

But somewhere on the way
We feel our hearts begin to harden
And see just as we learn to turn around
The garden is gone

Fury rages through your restless days
Shades of time that's gone before
Empty cages where the prisoner plays
'Til the door swings closed behind for evermore

But if I was to answer you
You know I'd surely answer wrong

I've loved you too long

Turning halfway toward the sun
You asked me to become your shade
But why should I be made to run
At the end of the parade?

Love is not that way at all
Love is not that way

You said you thought I'd lost my path

Dan Fogelberg,"Across the vein of night
There cuts a path of searing light
Burning like a beacon
On the edges of our sight
At the point of total darkness
And the lights divine divide
A soul can let its shadow stretch
And land on either side --
Either side

And balanced on the precipice
The moment must reveal
Naked in the face of time
Our race within the wheel
As we hang beneath the heavens
And we hover over hell
Our hearts become the instruments
We learn to play so well

Wealthy the spirit 
That knows its own flight
Stealthy the hunter 
Who slays his own fright
Blessed the traveler 
Who journeys the length of the light

Outside the pull of gravity
Beyond the spectral veil
Within our careful reasoning
We search to no avail
For the constant in the chaos
For the fulcrum in the void
Following a destiny
Our steps cannot avoid

Across the vein of night
There cuts a path of searing light
Burning like a beacon
On the edges of our sight
At the point of total darkness
And the lights divine divide
A soul can let its shadow
Stretch and land on either side

Wealthy the spirit 
That knows its own flight
Stealthy the hunter 
Who slays his own fright
Blessed the traveler 
Who journeys the length of the light

In a spiral never-ending
Are we drawn towards the source
Spinning at the mercy 
Of an unrelenting force
So we stare into the emptiness
And fall beneath the weight
Circling the Nexus in a
Fevered dance with fate --

Wealthy the spirit 
That knows its own flight
Stealthy the hunter 
Who slays his own fright
Blessed the traveler 
Who journeys the length of the light

With the catch of they day in their holds

The fog meets the beaches and out on
the Reach it is raining --

It`s father and son
It`s the way it`s been done since the old days
It`s hauling by hand ten miles out
from the land where their chow waits

they hurry along.

And the Reach like a siren sings
as she beckons and calls
As the coastline recedes from view
And the seas swell and roll

To the depths of my soul --

There`s a frost on the sill in the morning
It creeps through the door
At the edge of the shore
ice is forming
Soon the northers will bluster and blow
And the woods will be whitened
with snowfall
And the Reach will lie frozen
for the lost and unchosen to row --

And how much it will cost
To recapture the souls
That we surely have lost.

In the cities and towns
There are millions who dream
But the traffic's so loud
That you can't hear them scream

There's a heaven on earth
That so few ever find
Though the map's in your soul
And the road's in your mind.

So many mountains before us
So many rivers to cross
Where is the wisdom to bring
Back the vision we've lost?

Can we gaze with the wonder of children
Into the deafening night
Has it gotten so dark
That you cannot remember the light?

When you sleep on the ground
With the stars in your face
You can feel the full length
Of the beauty and grace.

In the wild places man
Is an unwelcome guest
But it's here than I'm found
And it's here I feel blessed",Aurora Nova
Dan Germain,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Dan Germain,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town

And what did I do, I thought about you",I Thought About You
Dan Germain,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Over the shadows and the rain

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Dan Hartman,"Your eyes, your eyes are the windows of the soul
Don't you know?
And every time they look at me
It's a pleasure what they show

And do you wanna celebrate the light inside of me?
Real emotion for everyone to see
Song to sing with a sweet melody
Somethin' to believe in, tell you how I feel

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes

And darling when I hold you, you give it back to me
I can't imagine anything that I would rather see
From the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes

The touch, the touch of your hand so fundamental
In my head, in my heart, in my soul healing on so many levels
It doesn't matter what we're going through
One thing with me is that I'll always love you

And don't change a thing, that's my advice
I'm singing about the sweetness you bring into my life

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Oh baby, it's the love in your eyes, the love in your eyes

And darling, when I hold you, you give it back to me
I can't imagine anything that I would rather see
From the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes
The love in your eyes, oh baby

I know this love holds many changes
Not everyday will be a day without the past
Ah, don't you worry, just give it up to heaven
If we release control love will surely last
I want the people want to show your love will last
Ooh, baby, baby, baby love will last

I wanna celebrate the light I see
Real emotion between you and me
Song to sing with a sweet melody
Somethin' to believe in, I tell you how I feel

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes

And darling, when I hold you, you give it back to me
I can't imagine anything that I would rather see
From the love in your eyes
I said I see the love in your eyes, the love in your eyes
The love in your eyes

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes, is in your eyes
Darling, when I hold you, you give it back to me",The Love in Your Eyes

They say they've tried but it's all in vain
I've begged and I've pleaded, I even got mad
Now we must face it, you give me a pain

How can I miss you when you won't go away?
Keep telling you day after day
But you won't listen, you always stay and stay
How can I miss you when you won't go away?

Your never ending presence really cramps my style
I dream that it won't always be the same
At first I was attracted but after a while
Have you ever heard of the hard-to-get game?

How can I miss you when you won't go away?
I keep telling you day after day
But you won't listen, you always stay and stay
How can I miss you when you won't go away?
And I mean it, too

Out of three billion people, why must it be me?
Oh, why, oh, why won't you cut me loose?
Just do me a favor and listen to my plea
I'm not the only chicken on the roost

Thanks, Dan
Yeah, you remind me of a girl who lives in my apartment complex (oh, yeah?)
Really, I don't know where she does her shoppin', but man, what style

She's a bit old-timey, but that's alright with me
She wears a dress of velvet that hangs below her knees, her knees
She's a bit old-fashioned, as all the world can see
The cameo she wears upon her bosom, puts me in ecstasy, ecstasy
Yes, she's her own grandmother, that's what they're telling me
But my old-timey baby is swell enough for me, you see

You see, she plays her old Victrola
The lamp is low, kerosene, you know
You know we lie, we lie upon her bed
The patchwork quilt beneath her head
(Her wheel is spinning, spinning) or while her wheel is spinning
She sews some lace or we embrace
Or when we go out strolling, the world can plainly see

She's hip enough for me",My Old Timey Baby [#]

Dan Hicks,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Dan Hill,"He caught her signal
As she strolled in the bar
Amidst all the lonely people
Out to prove they're popular
And he came upon her slowly
Not sure of what to say
Trying to sound clever, but words got in the way

Conversation wandered,
Though their eyes seldom met
They both knew what they were after
And they played it step by step
And his mind was getting foggy
The drinks were coming fast
Momentary friendship, with no future and no past

All alone in California
Looking for some fun
His eyes were feeling heaving
He kind of wished that he could run
The colors started spinning
As she kissed away his doubts
The night was just beginning
As his body began to melt

She watched the sunrise
While he slept in dreams unknown
And she wondered what his name was
Though she barely knew her own
And she slowly started crying
Though she wasn't white sure why
Trying to fight an emptiness
That haunted her insides.",All Alone in California
Dan Hill,"Fancy hotel rooms
Windows with a view
Staring into nothing
I thought I saw you
Your colors dancing in my mind
But they were only neon signs
Oh Canada
I'm trying to find you
Will you wait for me.

There's people on the street
I know I'll never meet
I wonder what they're thinking
What their dreams are
But they just keep on walking by
I can see the questions in their eyes
Oh Canada
You're a tree among towers
Just starting to climb
Please don't grow too quickly now
Don't leave us all behind

Pages of progress start to turn
Too quickly and the pages burn
Let's hope that we don't learn, too late
Let's hope it's never too late to learn
No don't let the madness wash you way.

Life keeps rolling by
Before it goes I'll try
To be stronger, to be wiser
Maybe just understand
What makes people fight to survive
While by themselves they slowly sigh

Dan Hill,"Well I've been way so long
I'm too numb to dislike it
And LA'S one big hit song
I never learned to fight it

Dear Caroline
It never meant to go this far
It started out to be a game
I never meant to be a star.

And everybody smiles
But their eyes stare out so empty
From a face they scrub with Dial
And the words that spill so fancy

Dear Caroline
I thought my songs would change the world
Instead of slowly getting rich
Off the emotions of young girls.

And what really makes me laugh
Is that nothing's really changed
Since that day I left you years ago

To find myself a name
And what really makes me cry
Is that it's only an illusion
And all that success means
Is just money and confusion.

I've been told you settled down
Found yourself a family
I'll send my latest record down

And I've been along - most of my life
I guess it hurt me

But never have I felt so less alone
I beg you darling
Don't desert me

And some believe in love
And some believe it's misplaced feelings
And me - I always change my mind
So many words have lost all meaning

And still you come for me
Your eyes too blurred by love
To know just what you see
You make me weak
You make me strong
It's all the same
We share a breath of happiness
We share the pain
Always changing

And I give to you

Dan Hill,"Take it if you will
Take it if you can,
Or refuse it, I will understand
It's just some flowers
My family just moved in around the corner
Will you be my friend
I touched her on the shoulder
She was fourteen I was barely older

Take it if you will
Take it if you can,
Or refuse it, I will understand
It's just a key
My parents are going away for the weekend
Will you stay with me
It felt my body trembling
High school days were nearly at an end then

Time was a blur of emotions
Spinning so fast
And time was a rocket engine
With no end and no beginning
But all time stopped when she said yes

Take it if you will
Take it if you can
Or refuse it, you know I'll never ask again
It's just a ring
At best it's just a symbol of everything
If I can share my life with you
Standing naked in my fear
I could not face her
Then I broke down, my arms embraced her

Take it if you will
Take it if you can
Or refuse it
That's how our lives began",Proposal
Dan Hill,"Washed out in the stillness of the night
She's left searching
Once again love's promise has been broken
And he snores indifferently to the rhythm of her breathing
As she lights a cigarette and waits for morning
Light years apart, they lie both together
Like a child caught playing with matches
She's been burned again by fire
And she knows she's been betrayed by her own imagination
The cigarette keeps burning as she curses her desire.

And she thinks
She's the only one who's lonely
And she wants the world to feel sorry
And she's trapped
Within her own self pity
And she asks: will anybody love me.

And on the radio an old song sings
Suggesting that love is why we're living
As she turns the station fast.

She looks down at her lover
A friend of a friend of a stranger
As if his mouth might breathe an answer
And she knows she's getting older
The emptiness controls her
And the smoke curls round her fingertips
Like question marks in time
The sun plays with the windows
As the man wakes up beside her
Silences are awkward as he reaches for his clothes
And as he leaves
She feels suspended, invaded and rejected
The cigarette is ended
That's how her story goes

And on the radio a new song sings
Suggesting that love is why we're living
Ironically she laughs
As she turns the station fast
She's given up on giving
Washed out in the stillness of the night
She's left searching",Question Marks in Time
Dan Hill,"And the rain keeps falling
From the clouds in your eyes
As we try to hang on
To the time that's passed us by
And the deeper our love
The harder we cry.
You and I both slaves
To some far away dreams
That binds us as one
Then divide us it seems
That the deeper our drifting
The harder we try

[Chorus]
And life goes on I suppose
And love can fade
As fast as it grows
Times they may shake us
But nothing can break us
You now.

The trees are still standing
The water stays still
The air tastes so lonely
I fight off a chill
Let this song bid goodbye
Until we return

[Chorus]

And the rain keeps falling
From the clouds in your eyes
As we try to hang on
To the time that's passed us by
And the deeper our love
The harder we cry.",Rain

And boys can be so insecure
They made you drink a bit too much
Everything's a blur of feel and touch
Did he really like you
How can you be sure enough

23 today and all your friends are getting married
You say they're so scared of being alone
So self righteously you march though teachers college
Still so much in life you gotta get to know
Seems like everybody's so content to move so slow 

And when you think you've got your life so well controlled
It slips away
And the years like raindrops falling from your life are
Washed away
You're so brilliant, you're so gifted, so sensitive, so strong
As you hide behind your barricade of words
But no one got close enough to you to have ever heard 

I met you at a party you were drunk and full of world advice
And I was getting nervous
You said you had a child who was a genius and you smiled
As the living room transformed into your circus
Someone whispered you were 39 today a face so you
Eyes so old
You collapsed into the corner
Like somebody of raw nerves you near seduced me
With your verbs
As I reached out for you
You said over and over 

Children come home from school
Shout and laugh with all their life
Shut em out fast before you think of the past
Turn out all your lights
Go to bed got to sleep don't think don't feel
As the night time moans a prayer
That maybe somewhere deep inside
There's some meaning aching to be shared",14 Today
Dan Hill,"Mmm, you're crazy and all the shrinks in the world 
Couldn't help you in any way
You look at me with that spaced out stare 
And I have to run away-ay
You say you don't want my money-ey
You say you just want some time
With your fingers in my pockets
You call it love, I call it a cri-i-i-i-i-ime

You say you've finally found yourself
You say you've seen some light
All I see are those empty eyes
Starin' out into the lo-onely night
You're crazy woman, in a crazy world
You're crazy enough to say
I feel orange, I need some company
And five is my number today-ay-ay-ay-ay-yeah

You're losin' touch, any foo-ool can see that much
I feel so helpless I don't know what to say
You'll lose yourself tryin' so hard to prove yourself
While the real world slowly slips away-ay
Your one time friends sense
The madness carved in lines - upon your face

Mmm, you're lonely and one night with me 
Won't wash that emptiness aside
Your desperate cry for company 
Turns friends to strangers
Your needs once more denied
Reality knows no feelings
It'll leave you far-are behind
I've just gotta break away from you 
Before I lose my mi-i-i-i-i-ind

You wrote yourself a letter, two wee-eeks ago today
Then you made a paper aeroplane
And laughed as it sai-ailed through space

You're losin' touch, any foo-ool can see that much
You turn to me-ee and I ha-ave to turn away-ay
Don't you know, you'll lose yourself 
Tryin' so hard to prove yourself
While the real world slowly slips away-ay
Your one time friends sense
The sadness carved in pain - upon your face",Crazy
Dan Hill,"Playin' games again I can feel the apprehension
For every word that leaves your mouth
Is swallowed by the tension
And if indeed it helps at all
I relate to what you're frightened of
'Cause so many things these days have been crushed

In the name of lo-o-ove
Actin' strong again as if you don't really need me
But the weakness that you once betrayed
Turned to be the strength that freed me
And I won't ask a thing of you
That you're not secure in giving of
'Cause so many things these days have been crushed

In the name of lo-ove
Now I know it's not that easy
When you don't know where you stand
At times I think I've never stood at all
Look around you'll see for every woman, child and man

Love has played its games upon us all
Playin' roles again both actin' so defensive
As if some pre-programmed machine

Took over all our senses
I'd trade everything I own
For the thrill of fa-a-allin' in love
'Cause so many things these days have been saved
In the name, of lo-ove",In the Name of Love
Dan Hill,"You've been a friend of mine for so-o many year-ears
When I first came to Vancouver with dreams twisting in fear-ear
And oh Jean, friends are like rare stones
Increasing in their value when realized they can't be owned
And I'd write songs only when the pain became too obvious inside
When the screaming in my soul left me no-o place to hide

And whoa Jean, love is like a prayer
So afraid of your own questions as you stand unanswered there-ere-ere
Still you walk the other way rather than risk rejection
Watch the wind blow all hope away as you crawl into yourself for protection
Still I try to make you see there's so much more I've gotta be
Oh don't turn away, don't lose to the cold, don't leave me here-ere to die alone

A little of your love couldn't hurt me none
Let it shine on through like rays from the sun
And a little of my love couldn't hurt you none
Let it run beside you, let it flow inside you, let it purify
You break down and I stumble for the right words of consolation
The circle of love spins round and round searchin' for new destinations

Whoa Jean, life is like the sea-ea
Trapped within it's shorelines we're still strugglin' to break free
Still we walk the other way rather than risk rejection
Watch the wind blow all hope away as we crawl into ourselves for protection
Still I try to make you see, I love you so it frightens me
Whoa, don't turn away, don't lose to the cold, nobody wants to die alone

A little of your love couldn't hurt me none
Let it shine on through like rays from the sun
And a little of my love couldn't hurt you no-one
Let it run beside you, let it flow inside you,",Jean
Dan Hill,"You walked into my room, a lover from the past
A lifetime since I looked into your eye-eyes
You held me like one holds onto a dream that has gone bad
Ain't it scary how so many dreams run dry

You've traveled round the world two times since you've left me
Fell in love three times, grown restless another four
But through the haze of love and pain
You say you wanna feel young again
Ain't it funny how that happens when you get older
Whoa when you get o-older

And you don't know-ow me anymore, I've changed 
The innocence you found disappeared when you went away
And I don't fall in love that quickly like I used to do
The passion still explodes, bound by a longer fuse

You're livin' with a rock 'n' roll musician off the coast
I hope he makes it, walk alone at night just to get away
He waits for you in bed and when it don't feel good you learn to fake it
I can see you lyin' silent in your rage, woh-oh in silent rage

And you don't know-ow me anymore, I've changed 
The innocence you found disappeared when you went away
And I don't fall in love that quickly like I used to do
The passion still explodes, bound by a longer fuse
Bound by a longer fuse (I don't fall in love)
Bound by a longer fuse (I don't fall in love)
(I don't fall in love)",Longer Fuse
Dan Hill,"This is just a song to say
That I'm proud for what they are
And I hope my world can take me
Half that far

Way back in Mccarthy's day
My parents left the USA
Young rebellious lovers
They left behind a nation far too proud
And powerful to say
That love transcends all colors
Some black men turned against my father
Some white men turned against my mother
Each race has their place they all would say

And with a past so battle worn
And a future begging to be born
They found a life that's growing still today

And glancing through the years
And living through their fears
I hope they can accept my goals
A bit confused, a bit unclear

And all the years behind me now
Seem like a book I've read and yet somehow
I still don't understand all the words
All the black and all the white
That rest in me that make me fight
Remind me of all the knowledge left to learn
Still some black men turned against my father
Some white men turned against my mother
Each race has their place they all would say
With a past so battle worn
And a future begging to be born
They found a life that's growing still today

And glancing through the years
And living through their fears
I hope they can accept my goals
A bit confused, a bit unclear

This is just a song to say that I'm proud for what they are
And I hope my world can take me half that far",McCarthy's Day
Dan Hill,"When the sun sets beneath the mountain tops 
And the water begins to rise 
I try to contain my excitement 
But the force of the night conquers my surprise 
Kids on the street corner peddlin' maps 
On how to meet the stars 
Prostitute turns, my body burns 
She'll cure your loneliness for half an hour 

Cars breeze dow-own the avenue 
Rock 'n' roll's suspended in mid air 
A girl cha-anting nonsense takes my money 
Puts a flower in my hair 
Billboards grin and my head spins 
This may be heaven but it's not my home 
All the sunshine and beautiful people 
Make me feel more and more alone 

Southern California, where your dreams almost come true 
Southern California, where everyone's a star except for you 
Southern California, like a beautiful girl you cannot touch 
Everyone lives forever here, those were my thoughts 

And I don't wanna be a part of that all American dream 
But still I keep on comin' back, I can't let it get the best of me 
(The best of me, best of me) 
Lord give me the strength to see myself clearly, see myself clearly 
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, and time flies by like a meteor in the sky-y 
And I'm wondering is it just me 
Everything seems so perfect like some commercial on TV (on TV, TV, TV) 
Lord give us the strength to show real feelings, real feelings 

In Southern California, where your dreams almost come true 
In Southern California, where everyone's a star except for you

Everyone lives forever here, everyone lives forever here 
Everyone lives forever here, everyone lives forever here

Dan Hill,"Still not used to havin' people pay to hear me
Guess I'm still a child tryin' so hard to please
Tryin' to seek approval through my songs
And do you still love me or have I been away too long

Whoa, thought I'd write and say I'm still on the road
Tryin' to share my life with people, most of whom I'll never know
Manitoba skyline goes and goes 
Like a thousand miles of canvas stretched flat against the sky
Freshly painted colors just waitin' to be dried by time

And do you still play hide and seek with a-all the children in the park
Fill their heads with crazy stories till the daylight is blinded by the dark
Do you still dance through a snowfall 
While the flakes perform a ballet in mid air-air-air
I can almost hear you laughin', I wish that I-I was there, to share-are

I'm still not used to havin' people pay to hear me
Guess I'm still a child tryin' so har-ard to please
Tryin' to seek approval through my songs
And do you still love me or have I been away too long

And as I look back on my roots graspin' for faith I still don't understand
My shadow of youth loosens its ho-old on me with tremblin' hands
So I carve the words I miss you out in stone, tossed it in the air
Wished I could fly-y beside it there, I'd fly to you back home
Even the strong need someone to break down with and hold

I'm till not used to havin' people pay to hear me

Tryin' to seek approval through my songs

That you thought out all the answers
Wanna get back together again
Oh but a strangers voice rings through my ears
And though I listen you are all I hear
And girl I didn't mean to drive you away
People come and go so fast
But all I see is your face

There's an old man on the corner
Just staring at the sea
I wanna hold him like a broken doll
Ask him if he's lonely like me
The waves crash like a violent dream
The mist flies and the seagulls scream
And the old man he sees nothing just stares into space
And me all I can see is your face

Now I know there are no promises in love
You've gotta give it all you have
And hope that maybe you can share
Maybe you can share your life with someone
A Stranger touches me and all I can feel
Is your embrace
A stranger looks my way
And all I ever see is your face

I've got my songs to protect me
I've got my friends to ease the pain
They say time will heal this emptiness
Girl without you it ain't the same
I don't see any stars tonight
Just the darkness of the city lights
I close my eyes once more and try to escape
And all I can see is your face",All I See Is Your Face
Dan Hill,"Wake up to the madness of the city
Say hello its a brand new day
Brush my teeth read the paper
Everything is changing so fast it stays the same
Cars attack the city street
City sidewalk, city heat
People push and people fly
No one laughs and no one cries
Someone save me.

Look up, an office building
Stares right back indignantly
Look down, my feet keep moving
Shuffling to the city's endless beat
Billboards tell me what to buy
How to dress and how to die
Traffic signals starts to change
Madness starts all over again
Someone save me.

My doctor says I need a brief vacation
Wife says its just a stage, Ill be alright
Boss says Ive got too much imagination
Papers tell me rain again tonight.

Wake up to the madness of the city
Close my eyes and fly to mars
A man jolts my arm I swing out madly
He swings back and I see stars
I curse my world beneath my breath
I curse myself I curse whats left
People push, people fly
No one laughs, no one cries
Someone save me",City Madness
Dan Hill,"Ma cried like a lady
Pa cried like a man
1963 - one less kennedy
And I was too young to understand
And the years flew by in colours
Each one a little faster than before
And as the war caused some to cry
I'd identify
My tv keeping score
Growing up - in the shadow of the u.s.a.
Trying to find - the meaning of life today
America - it's a heavy kind of role you
Play
You're the hero - you're the villain
Your every move is on display

Ma cried like a lady
Pa cried like a man
1963 - one less kennedy
And I was too young to understand
We were all too young to understand
",Growing Up
Dan Hill,"So you flung your fist high in the air
But the world remained the same
And all the demonstrations
Filtered out through graduation
And the times that were a changing
Never changed
Freedom takes on new meaning
When you have a family of five
And peace and revolution dissolved in its own solution
When you're fighting for your life
Just to survive

It's then you've gotta
Hold on - for what you believe in
Hold on - don't let it fade
Still you've gotta
Be strong - find yourself a reason
You never change the world
But just the same
You've gotta hold on stronger
Each and every day
When the night creeps in so hollow
When the silence makes you scream
When you're so damned scared of failure
When the world's burned out it's saviors
When you're feeling too vulnerable to dream

It's then you've gotta
Hold on - for what you believe in
Hold on - don't let it fade
Still you've gotta
Be strong - find yourself a reason
You never change the world
But just the same
You've gotta hold on stronger
Or else you'll fade
",Hold On
Dan Hill,"I could spend my whole life writing love songs
If they'd help bring me closer to you
Trying to find the right words
But they all get so blurred

While expressing my feelings I get so confused
I can analyze and you can analyze
We can both analyze till we're blue
Let emotions take reign let them play their own games
Let the freedom of youth captivate you

Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away

No I know you've been hurt you've been broken
Life just ain't real without pain
And there's no guarantee that all ends happily
But when you fall you gotta rise up swinging again
And you can run away I can run away
We can both run till our lives are through
Some people hide till their hollow inside
Please don`t allow this to happen to you

Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away

I'm so damn tired of hearing songs about pain
There's so much to learn, life's too short now to spend it afraid
Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away",Let the Song Last Forever
Dan Hill,"Phone broke the silence of the night
I'd been sleeping
And a voice said, how you doing Dan
Thought I'd call you for no reason.
And my mind flashed back two years
Since the last time I'd see her
When the love we'd shared had died

And she said, things are going well for you
I'm glad you still have music
I remember times you felt so damned confused
I thought you'd lose it
Do you still make crazy faces
At the mirror in the morning
How come you never said goodbye.

[Chorus]
I chose my words so carefully
But I felt my past seducing me
Slow down, she said
I just want to be your friend
I said, that's the way the whole thing started
And I just can't fall in love with you again
Knowing it'll end.

And all I heard was silence
And I wished she was beside me
Like the first time we made love
And I felt waterfalls inside me
So I tried to dial her number
But my fingers froze
And slowly, I closed my eyes",Phone Call
Dan Hill,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie

And who am I to judge you
In what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance's in all strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the years security
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize-fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry

I don't want my name in lights
You burn out so fast
You turn to smoke in the night

I don't want no presidential parlor
It's a little too clean in that big white tower
Baby, all I want is you

I don't wanna be born again
Rest my soul in your hands
Take my chance in the end
Baby, all I want is you

And all, all my life I've waited
For you to come along
There's been so many strangers in my life
Filled with the dark spaces of my night
But now the darkness is all gone

I don't want no social graces
Get too damn dizzy
Wearing all those different faces

Made me gratefully aware
That I was happy, so real so undefined
And I just want you to be you
In a lifestyle undefined

You really love him
I can see you in his eyes
And like a fountain, he offers no disguise
And babe, I'm glad he's never tried

I read somewhere that grown men never cry
Their heart just freezes over for a day
So instead here's my masculine goodbye
May love be with you all the way
My guitar does all my crying anyway

There's happiness combined
With the pain within my mind
You gave me feelings
That I never knew existed

And all you'd do is laugh
And my defenses would be lifted and I love you
You're sketched so softly in my eyes
And like a fountain, I offer no disguise
And babe, I'm glad I've never tried

Surely wants me to

That there's more to my life then greets my eyes
Just a crazy kind of feeling
Then I take a look around
This world's falling down
Only a clown could believe, believe

Well everyone's had hopes I guess
On how the world should be
Everyone's had dreams that just elude reality

Reading playboy magazine
Insisting that the articles
Were the only things we'd read

Conquer
And if a girl said she liked you
Then you'd bonk her
Don't try to lay that mush on me

Looking back a high school
Getting drunk for the local dance
Lonely boys - nervous girls
Grappling with romance
Thinking then that love
Meant something frightening
A sudden end as brutal
As bolts of lightening
Don't know what it was, but it scared me

From one night stands to wedding bands
To struggling to stay free
Watching time move faster
As hold on helplessly
As love smolders waiting to be tamed
We grow older staying much the same

Looking back a college life
Seemed like such a compromise
Unsure of my direction
Using brains as my disguise
Thinking then that love meant to
Remember
You only felt its warmth
When you surrendered
Don't know what it was, but it scared me

To struggling to stay free

Dan Hill,"The boy left for New York, he left the woods
And trees behind and no one knows just what's on his mind
He says he's lost, he'll pay any cost
Just to find out where he belongs

But the girl left for the country, she left those
Blaring lights behind and no one knows just what's on her mind
She says she's lost, she'll pay any cost
Just to find out where she belongs

Nobody's right, nobody's wrong
Everybody's searching
We're all searching for where we belong

The boy lives in a high rise now, he's neighbors with the sky
The mirror in the hallway keeps on asking, why?
The silence knows the change will help him grow
Help to find where he belongs

The girls lives in a cabin now, she gazes at the sky
The shooting stars keep falling, they keep on asking, why?
The silence knows the change will help her grow
Help her to find where she belongs

Nobody's right, nobody's wrong
Everybody's searching
We're all searching for where we belong

Some claim that we're weak, some say we're strong
Something says we're all searching
We're all searching for where we belong

Juggling wonderment with tear

Oh and nothing can seem stranger

Until my life will be no longer

Let the songs keep flowing strong
And naturally

The gift of music is the key
To all my tears, my laughter
And though it claims to set me free
It reigns my life as master

Lord don't let this crazy world
Make a jukebox out of me
Let the songs keep flowing strong
And naturally

And oh, let me say this peacefully
Forget the dreams, forget the fantasies
Let me make it honestly
Or not at all

And oh, let me say this forcefully
Forget the dreams, erase the fantasies
Let me make it honestly
Or not at all

The seed of music within me
Has bloomed into a flower
And though it claims to set me free
I'm lost within its power

Lord don't let this crazy world
Make a jukebox out of me
Let the songs keep flowing strong
And naturally

A gift to share for all my friends
And me
",Seed of Music
Dan Hill,"Hand me down another whiskey sour
I'm a willing victim to the spell and I just can't rebel
I'm far too thirsty and too tired

Hold me like you'd hold a broken soldier
Who's forgotten the meaning of war please don't' close that door
I'm about as pure as a children's choir

Sunshine, can you spread your warmth over me?
Chase the clouds from the sky casually
Make me feel like a child once again

Sunshine, how does it feel lost in the sky?
Is it dizzy looking down from that high?
Well you know you've always got a friend

One more drink and this day will be over
I can already feel the cold, my jacket I sold
For fifteen dollars worth of booze

One more drink and I'll be off on some rainbow
Looking down at this world below I'm so high that I'm low
But this is the only life I'd choose

Sunshine, can you spread your warmth over me?
Chase the clouds from the sky casually
Make me feel like a child once again

Sunshine, how does it feel lost in the sky?
Is it dizzy looking down from that high?
Well, you know you've always got a friend

Well, you know you've always got a friend

Dan Hill,"Welcome baby boy
To a brand new world
May the tears fall like a rainstorm
From your eyes
Looks like life kinda took you
By surprise
You're so tiny that it scares me
Your nakedness just stares at me
And I never thought my head
Could spin so high
Welcome baby boy
Don't look so confused
One day I'll try to sit down and explain
That the love that brought you here
Will never change
You're so helpless that it shakes me
Yet so charged with life you make me
So happy that I think I'm gonna cry
Life has come to greet your child
Play it safe- play it wild
Reach for the truth beyond
The rules beyond the games
Life is yours and yours along
Free to settle - free to roam
Free to grow - free to change
Free to fight to stay the same
Welcome baby boy
To a brand new world
May the tears fall like a rainstorm
From your eyes
Looks like life kinda took you
By surprise
Oh surprise",Welcome
Dan Hill,"[Chorus:]
You make me want to be a father
Trade my wandering path of freedom
For your soul
Oh and all I once defied
And locked so deep inside
Is on a roller coaster riding out of control

You make me want to be a teacher
Teach that love is all there is
And still there's more
Oh and everywhere I turn
And everything I learn
Shows me there's something new
I've never seen before

Words can only take a thought so far
And I've almost gone as far as I can go
To see each other as we really are
Exploring all around us
As we grow
And we grow
And we grow

You make me want to be a writer
Write this world a crazy love song
For today
Let me glide upon your smile
It beams for miles and miles
Catch it now before it sails away
Oh and words can only take a thought so far
And I guess I've gone as far as I can go
To see each other as we really are
Exploring all around us
As we grow
And we grow
And we grow

Dan Hill,"You say you're free
Well, your freedom's killing me
And I feel just like a statue
To be admired from a distance
My love collides with your resistance
Then bounces back inside of me

You tell me that you're strong
Well, your strength just shatters me
As I scramble for my pieces
But the puzzle keeps repeating
It seems so self-defeating
How we plan each move so carefully

And still we both hang on
We risk the night and greet the dawn
An affair for you, for me a song
And then suddenly it's over

Two cynics passing through
I blew it, I fell in love with you
The thing I swore I'd never do
And now my love just turns you colder

You say you're trying to find yourself
Well, I know how hard that is
And I wish that I could help you
To share while life keeps teaching
To share while you keep reaching
But you prefer to reach out privately

And still we both hang on
We risk a night and greet the dawn
An affair for you, for me a song
And then suddenly it's over

Two cynics passing through
I blew it, I fell in love with you
The thing I swore I'd never do
And now my love just turns you colder

You say you're free
Your freedom's killing me
I feel just like a statue
To be admired from a distance
My love collides with your resistance
Then bounces back inside of me
The pattern goes on endlessly

Dan Hill,"I see your face cloud over like a little girl's,
And your eyes have lost thier shine.
You whisper something softly I'm not meant to hear,
Baby, tell me what's on your mind.

I don't care what people say
About the two of us from different worlds.
I love you so much that it hurts inside,
Are you listening?

Listen to me, girl.

Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
Love you so much baby,
That it tears me up inside.

I hear you on the telephone with God knows who,
Spilling out your heart for free.
Everyone needs someone they can talk to,
Girl, that someone should be me.

So many times, I tried to tell you,
You just turned away.

How did I know?

My life is changing so fast now,
Leaves me lonely and afraid.

Don't be afraid, girl.

Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?

Will the truth throw you away

Are we so afraid to surrender all

What in the world are we so frightened of
Why can't we gamble on desire

Of what is false and what is real

As we sometimes like to feel
We can spend our lives running all the time
Or we can make a stand together

She was gonna have a baby
A part of me went weightless
For the first time in my life
There was nothing I could say
It's like a miracle from the stars above
Paralyzed with fear
I was overcome with love

She said soon you'll hear the beating
Of an unborn heart
This is the answer
You've been searching for so hard
And for the first time in my life I felt
The wave of love so deep
As I listened for the unborn child's heartbeat

I said something stupid like, how are you feeling
She smiled the warmest smile I've ever seen
Oh, I guess that said it all
Now were a far cry from the storybook romance
Something in her eyes, made me crumble
I reached out for her hand

She said soon, you'll hear the beating
Of an unborn heart
This is the answer

And for the first time in my life I felt

And I lie awake at night and wonder
How a child survives
Beyond the danger in the strangers
And the inhumanity

Why do we always hurt the ones we love?

How I wish that I could tell you, it's all in the past.
But I was never good at lying, and baby since you asked,

I don't want to hear that song again, from the night we first met.
I don't want to hear you wispering, things I'd rather forget.
I don't want to look into your eyes, 'cause you know what happens next.

That the man you built your dreams around, just broke your heart again.

'Cause I once loved you so much.
That I swore I'd rather die, than live a day without your touch.

Behind the high school, cutting class.

You were my Venus.

Where does all the time go?
Look at us now.
Caught up in our different worlds.
Though we gone our separate ways I found.

I miss you still.
It's the middle of the night and I'm calling you.
Cause I can't hold back what I feel inside.
I miss you still.
Your a piece of my heart that I can't let go.
Though it tears me apart, you should know.
That I miss you still.

You remember when.
You said I'd always be your man.
How you reached out for my hand.
Your fingers trembled.
How your daddy hated me.
How it drove him to distraction.
That was part of the attraction.
Way back when girl.
Where do the years go.
It seems like yesterday.
Well God this world seems different now.
Maybe some things, some things never change.

I miss you still.
It's the middle of the night and I'm calling you.
Cause I can't hold back what I feel inside.
I miss you still.
Cause your a piece of my heart that I can't let go.
Though it tears me apart, you should know.
That I miss you still.

Maybe I'm a sentimental fool who's lost control.
I just close my eyes and memories of you cut into my soul.

Your a piece of my heart that I can't let go.

Dan Hill,"Fourteen today, and you went dancing.
Music mixed with laughter, and boys can be so immature.
They made you drink a bit too much,
Everything's a blur to feel and touch.
Did he really like you? well, how can you be sure enough?

Twenty-three today, and all your friends are getting married.
You say they're so scared of being alone,
So self-righteously you march through teachers' college.
Still so much in life you gotta get to know,
Seems like everybody's so content to move so slow.

And when you think you've got your life so well-controlled, it slips away.
And the years, like raindrops falling from your life, are washed away,
Washed away.
And you're so brilliant, you're so gifted, so sensitive, so strong,
As you hide behind your barricade of words,
But no one got close enough to you to have ever heard.

I met you at a party.
You were drunk and full of world advice, and I was getting nervous.
And you said you had a child who was a genius,
And you smiled as the living room transformed into your circus.

Someone whispered you were 39 today,
A face so young, eyes so old. you collapsed into the corner
Like somebody up on verbs, you near seduced me with your verbs as I reached
Out for you,
You said over and over,
""oh, when you think you've got your life so well-controlled, it slips away.
And the years, like raindrops falling from your life, are washed away,
Washed away.""
And you're so brilliant, you're so gifted, so tragic and so wrong,
As you hide behind your barricade of words,
But you know, no one got close enough to you to have ever heard.

Children come home from school, shout and laugh with all their life.
Shut them out fast before you think of the past, turn out all of your lights.
Go to bed, go to sleep, don't think, don't feel as the nighttime owns a
Prayer.
But maybe somewhere deep inside there's some meaning aching to be shared.

Fourteen today, and you were dancing

Dan Hill,"Memories of when I was a little boy, four years old,
Waiting for my daddy to come home,
And now I look into the eyes of my own son,
Wondering what he's thinking of,
Waiting at the window when I come home.
Watch his eyes fill up with joy and wonder.
He reaches out his tiny hand;
I feel the bond 'tween boy and man.

Memories of my mom cryin', my daddy gone for weeks at a time,
Not knowing how to comfort her,
Facin' my pillow, pretendin' not to hear.
Now I write this letter to my little boy.
I'm far away, not knowing really what to say
Except, ""I'm sorry, oh so sorry.""
I don't want to make these same
Mistakes my daddy made with me.
Still his voice rolls off my tongue
When I say, ""Boy, protect your mom.""

Memories of my wife cryin' on the phone
Wonderin' when I'm coming home.
My voice sounds detached and cold,
Reminds me of someone that I knew;
He had a funny attitude
When I needed him to be
All the things only a daddy could be to me.
And I don't want to make the same
Mistakes my daddy made with me.
Still his voice rolls off my tongue
When I say, ""Not now, I'm busy son.""

Memories of lying in bed with my wife and son,
Overwhelmed by so much love,
Tryin' to explain how a man can cry
Yet still be happy,
Thinking of all the dumb mistakes I've made.
Now I understand my father's pain;
He did the best with what he knew.
I love you daddy.
I watched my son fall asleep
And wonder what he'll think of me
When years from now he sees his son
Reachin' out his tiny hands for love.

I feel you (so close) every time you breathe.
I need you more than I needed anyone, it's true.
I wanna make love to you.

Walking down some crowded street,
Your laughter (so pure) sounds like a symphony.
Desire sweeps through me tryin' to stay cool, it's true.
I wanna make love to you. wanna make love to you.

And it feels like we've waited so long
Just to see what we really feel.
Girl, with you by my side,
My world comes alive.

You whisper (so soft) something I can't repeat.
Your skin brushes close, touches mine so innocently.
The sun burns hot, need some relief, it's true.
I wanna make love to you (you're so close).
Wanna make love to you (wanna be a part of you).

And it feels like I've waited a lifetime
Just to tell you what's on my mind.
It's so hard to reveal
All the passion I feel.

I wanna make love to you. (I just wanna make love, oh.)
Wanna make love to you. (I just wanna make love to you.)

Dan Hill,"I just want to talk to you again,
want to get back to the place where i fit in.
Can't believe you're askin' what i'd always thought you knew:
How my life would be without you.

[Chorus]
If this world should ever stop spinnin' 'round,
If the stars should fall to pieces and tumble to the ground,
If a thousand children's voices sang but i never heard the sound,
That's how empty life would be if you should leave me now.

Sometimes it's hard to find the words,
And it's too late to take them back once you've been heard.
When i hear you cry it tears me up inside,
'cause then i realize

[Chorus]

Too many times i should have told you,
But my pride kept gettin' in the way.
Just the thought of living life without you
Was just too much, was just too much for me to take.

Dan Hill,"How can I forget the night we met?
I can still remember what you wore.
I had the strangest feeling like we'd met before.
Maybe it was something that you said.
How can I forget the night we met?

How can I forget when we first touched?
Never thought that I would want someone so much.
I looked in your eyes and then I knew for sure
You would be my love forevermore.
As you slept, I kept thinking of the night we met.

Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,
But I remember everything about you,
How you came and changed my life.

And how can I forget those wedding bells?
You looked like an angel, I remember well
How we danced all night and never touched the ground.
How can I forget the night we met?

Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,
But I remember everything about you,
How you came and changed my life.

How can I forget your greatest gift?
I swore I saw your eyes when I first looked at his,
And when you cried, the tears were falling from my eyes
As I held our baby, held on to his first breath.
How can I forget the first night that we met?
And how can I forget that night?
How can I forget the night we met?

Your most innocent kiss, girl, your sweetest caress

Here and now is all that matters
Right here with you is where I'll stay

Is shining through your eyes
And all that is you
Becomes part of me too,

I'd go down a happy man

Dan McIntyre,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Dan McMillion,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

But I'm home now, and things still look the same
I think I'll leave it 'til tomorrow to unpack,
Try to forget for one night that I'm back in my flat
On the road where the cars never stop going through the night,
To a life where I can't watch the sun set
I don't have time
I don't have time

I've still got sand in my shoes,
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye,
Anything else would have been confused
But I want to see you again

Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanity,
Should run a bath and then clear up the mess i made before i left here
Try to remind myself that i was happy here,
Before I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away,
From the road where the cars never stop going through the night,
To a life where I can watch the sun set,
And take my time
Take all my time

I've still got sand in my shoes,
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye,
Anything else would have been confused
But I want to see you again

Two weeks away,
All it takes,
To change and turn me around, 
I've fallen
I walked away,
And never said,
That I wanted to see you,
Again

I've still got sand in my shoes,
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Beware my foolish heart

Forever isn't long enough, to show you how I feel
Our love is deeper than the ocean
Stronger than steel
Forever isn't long enough, to show you how I feel

I wouldn't tell you secrets girl, just for words to say

When I swim into your waters, you know I want to drown
When I say to close your eyes your love is the only sound",Stronger Than Steel
Dan Roberts,"They packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call

He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

They never found her body, just her diary by the  bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'  she said, 'Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne?

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night
And if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne",The Beaches of Cheyenne
Dan Rose,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Long the skies were overcast

She wants to grab her telephone

and if he don't care, she'll get by

They were delirious with love
they were certain to win

He said, ""I guess I should have told you before.""

Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,
She knows she bounces like a yo-yo when he pulls her string,
It hurts to feel like such a fool.
She wants to tell him not to call or come a round again,
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him.
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in,
And she don't know which way to move.

She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind,
But if she could bear to walk away
she thinks he wouldn't mind
'Cause he just keeps himself 
so apart and there's no one else in her heart,
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard.

She's determined to try
but she'll still give in when he gives her a call.
She'll ask herself why, but in the end it won't matter at all.
Sure, she could sit at home, stay inside 
and sleep alone with her pride
And as she walks out that door, she feels 
as weak as before with nothing to hide.

She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing,
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,
She knows she bounces like a yo-yo when he pulls her string,
It hurts to feel like such a fool.
She wants to tell him not to call or come a round again,
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him.
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in,
And she don't know which way to move.

Dan Seals,"Saw your picture on a poster in a cafe out in Phoenix
Guess you're still the sweetheart of the rodeo
As for me and little Casey, we still make the circuit
In a one horse trailer and a mobile home

And she still asks about you all the time
And I guess we never even cross your mind

But, oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair

And, oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me, I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold

Well, Old Red, he's getting older and last Saturday he stumbled
But you know I just can't bear to let him go
Little Casey, she's still growing and she's started asking questions
And there's certain things a man just doesn't know

Her birthday came and you never even called
I guess we never cross your mind at all

But then sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair

And, oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me, I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold

Everybody said you'd make it big someday
And I guess that we were only in your way
But someday I'm sure you're gonna know the cost
'Cause for everything you win, there's somethin' lost

Dan Seals,"She's a small town girl with no room to grow 
And he's a reckless boy with no where to go 
They're like birds in a cage with no place to fly

And they rage on some how searching for the answers 
In the night like shadow dancers before their time is gone

In a rented room on a cross town street 
And she's lost her youth and he's lost his dreams 
But for a while they feel like they used to feel

Hoping something's there to save them

Dan Seals,"A campfire some coffee from a tin cup in my hand
Sure warms the fingers when it's cold
A-playing an old guitar a friend I understand
Sure smoothes the wrinkles in my soul
A-sleeping in the moonlight a blanket for the bed
Leaves a peaceful feeling in my mind
Waking up in the morning with an eagle overhead
Makes me want to fly away before my time
And I think God must be a cowboy at heart
He made wide-open spaces from the start
He made grass and trees and mountains and a horse to be a friend

And trails to lead old cowboys home again
Night life and big cities is alright for awhile
Sure makes you feel good when you're there
But the country's so pretty it goes on and on for miles
Takes away my troubles and my cares

An empty heart without a home

Don't know how but she reads my mind

When it's her sweet love I need

She was missing a window on her passenger side 
The floorboard was patched up with paper and tar

An American boy with his hands on the wheel 
Of a dream that was made of American steel 
Though the seats had the smell of a nickel cigar 
I really was something in my old yellow car 

Somewhere in a pile of rubber and steel 
Thee's a rusty old shell of an automobile 
And if engines could run on desire alone 
That old yellow car would be driving me home 

There's the seat where poor Billy threw up in his date 
And where Larry and Sally could no longer wait 
There was no road too winding and nowhere too far 

With two bucks of gas and my old yellow car 

Somewhere in a pile of rubber and steel 
Thee's a rusty old shell of an automobile 
And if engines could run on desire alone 
That old yellow car would be driving me home

Got a Mercedes Benz with a TV and bar

If a maid refused me with tossing curls

While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

So when you hold me tight I won't put up a fight
I'll just knock you out and watch you coming to
Just put me in a situation where I'm turning you on
I I 1
I'll be the devil's recreation and before too long
You could feel a sensation that's oh so strong.
So don't take me home baby . . .",Add Reality
Dan Swanö,"Sometimes when I think about it, it doesn't make any sense
I mean I'm alive and plan to be for yet another seventy years
Time waits for no one
Not even for god
We're only immortal for a limited time
Someone said we were only born to die
Someone said there is a meaning with it all
I love the world and I barely believe that I will leave it for good one day
Someone said my religion is the way
Someone said don't try to say that you are not afraid
No!
I refuse to let the angels take me away
I have already learned what heaven and hell is about
The big sleep is the only thing that is for sure and we're all gonna face it
It's something we have to endure

Dreamers say that time will come with a way to stay alive
They mean science will finally reach its goal and offer everlasting life

I love my life and it's so hard to hear that one day all I am will disappear
I have seen grief and what it does to you
The day will come when I will lose what I was made of
I try to imagine what that would be like but the thought is so unreal so it is filtered out
I'm so afraid that I won't have the chance to tell the ones I love how I really feel inside
I hide my emotions for far too long
I am so afraid to lose you all that's the essence of this song

Am I the only one to think that hell is to be left alone
To live without that special someone
To feel like the king that lost his throne
Have you ever seen the dying
Touched the fading one
The last time I saw the Queen of nostalgia she was basically already gone
Time waits for no one
Not even for heroes
Life will have its way and we have to follow
Someone said it might be true what they say
Someone said I will be able to freeze the frame of what you are today
I have no wish to be young forever
I just don't wanna die
Someone said our souls will live again
I say the only one that I wanna be is me

No!

I refuse to let the angels take me away
I have already learned what heaven and hell is about
The big sleep is the only thing that is for sure and we're all gonna face it",The Big Sleep
Dan Swanö,"[Chorus]
You create a hell for the ones to buy your illusion
You design a spell that you cast upon the forsaken
Hortative
You engender temptation
Re-create
Invent the latest sensation
Procreate
Produce the perfect delusion
Your god is digital

You erase the deviations
Adding beauty to the frail
Dreams contrived upon a drawing-table set the pace of the vain
Trust the vagaries of fashion
Do what all the others do
Total loss of independence
You've always wishing you were someone else

[Chorus]

You behold your victims inane
Opinions cast aside
And when they try to change
And try to find their native demeanor
They are frozen out, precluded from the coven from the mass of fools
There's a message and receivers who will see it as a rule
There's an image made to covet
Global mass-manipulation complete
High-technology will cover all the errors in the way
Can't you see that you deflower and deform the generations to come
You behold your victims inane
Opinions cast aside

I will have to confess
The music you listen to now
Is pretty damn far from the truth
In league with machines
That help me to play all of the harmonies born in my head
You behold your victims inane
Opinions cast aside",Creating Illussions
Dan Swanö,"Here I am in my chamber
In my room full of words
Always searching for patterns that will give life to a line
My poetry is frozen though it's beginning to melt
The solid form is changing to the liquid of thoughts written down
Sentence after sentence in a language not mine
Loss of point no direction
A jigsaw where no pieces fit
I envy the writers and the poets who know the way to the places poetry grow
There is no harvest if you never sow
So I beg, steal and borrow wherever I go
If words were like music this would be a book
But this is not even worth the time that it took
Not even a novel just a self-pity tale written by someone that always will
fail
So very fragile inside
That's why I hide it in the empty phrases",In Empty Phrases
Dan Swanö,"I have healed the broken wings of fallen angels and laid the wildest storms
 to rest
I have tamed the fury of a thousand oceans
All I've done is to fall asleep
A tribute to the dreaming
A hymn to the delusions that sometimes really feel like they're real
In the deepest slumber
Reality is blended with fantasies and things I have repressed
When I awake all the stories remain inside my head
Memories forgotten always reappear in the wicked sceneries
Characters that once fell into oblivion united with my recent past
Tribute to my dreaming
Hymn to the delusions that I sometimes really wish were for real
In the deepest slumber reality is twisted and staggered across the halls of
 my head
When I awake I can remember it still and it is nothing that my scenes can
Kill
And I fall through the passage of time
Then there's the nightmares
That never seen to leave my mind
I can't escape it
They're even stronger when I close my eyes
How to forget and how to erase all the wicked scenes in here
How to make them disappear and burn this patchwork of fear
How to delete
How do I stop all the sickening things I see in this spurious diary that
Wasn't made by me how to replace my artificial memories",Patchworks
Dan Swanö,"Shadows capes form a web across the sky and steal the light that runs the
Engine of my heart
Deceived by clouds but I know it will soon return to watch my every move
Like an eye in the sky
Lunatic
Obsessed I am indeed
I will gain no strength this moonless night
Heavens heart or just a forgotten stone
All life lost or is it yet to come
The stars will be alone in the firmament tonight
Shadows grow stronger across the sky
The sun prepares for battle
The night is soon to die
Vicious beams will soon obscure the presence of the sun of the night
My soul despise the dawning and the light that it will bring
Doomed to be nocturnal
A creature of the night
Another dawn dilutes the dark the void where I can live
The rays of light burn my skin and ravage my desire
I close my eyes and I await the vengeance soon to come
When the dusk will bring the unlight and heal me once again
I have to return to my tower before the twilight will drain me of live
Tomorrow I need to be caressed by the moonlit sky or my soul will be
Carried away by the light
Just like the sun of the night
The moon is mine
Oh how I long to be one with the sun of the night
Oh how I long to unite with the sun of mine",Sun of the Night
Dan Swanö,"A tale forgotten long ago brought to life again
Ancient wisdom ancient lies
Horrid lullabies for the earth
Time will turn my prophecies into reality and it will lead the world astray
Death found the remedy for its enemy
It's too late the seize the day
Time and my malicious spells live in harmony
They await the hour set
Rapture of all that is alive
The reaper will arrive to invert the hour glass

Oh uncreation
The evolution in reverse
Oh uncreation
The death of universe
His reflections on the end still unknown to man
Dark predictions dark clichés in this recital of doom
The world is aging backwards
The young remains the young
We all know tomorrow will be yesterday reborn
The time and space deserted will hold no life for man
We face these final hours to be buried in the past
Something is wrong with the sky tonight
The clouds are darker than ever before
There is unrest in the stars alight
As if they warned me for the distant roar
The sun is descending
Nevermore to shine
Light is lost forever
We are the last in line",Uncreation

Where you standin' at?
You can pick me up at the round busstation
Or I can take a plane
Give me a sek and I'll tell you how it went down

[Kool Keith]
I stayed in New York, depressed, walkin' mad through the block
Watching brothers go down, my project friends smoking rock
My group divided and everthing was undecided
I was drinking, thinking: ""Damn and my boat is sinking""
Everybody's wack can new groups comin' back
They on Arsenio, ???? on video
Watch this clownrhyme that's payed for a primetime
Everybody's mean, they're hard, they're killing mothers
Shootin' bang bang fake man killing brothers
I had to turn off the radio from all the war???
Mickey Mouse and friends all talking pop and lippy
Girls excited for what? And old ?facturated?
People got their brain washed and folks got manipulated
They start believing Donald Duck made the earth
The industry was cursed since the Dinosaur's birth

Flying nighttime, eating peanuts on the plane
With no moneycontrol, my stress builds on my brain
My ticket's oneway
I'm out to southern Caliway
I left behind some people that wasn't even equal
I thought back with chicks and freaks in 86'
When Marlie was in in control +the funky magic mix+
I had the limousine on hold with the real chauffeur
Ripped the ???? up with Ultra and I felt like Oprah
Girls in flocks and fans in lines from blocks
I didn't even hear a ?paperview? rappin' mister
I was your idol and probably on your older sister
Now you bad you signed stupid with a recorddeal
Your image is butt you perpertrating Shootin' Steel
Holdin' guns on albumcovers just to make funds
You the man quick fast payed out the ?anoass?
You can see I'm back and clear on stereo
with my own style, my intimite material

Ye, your style changed every year
Think about what you did
Used to dance, used to wear suits
Then you came back to wearing hip-hop clothes
Then you went back to wearing suits

Money, expenses for trips I didn't know
Agencies finding shows I couldn't get myself
Writing rhymes at night in the house by myself
I open mailboxes, all I see was more bills
Gettin' cold chicken, walkin' down Ryan's hills
Askin' moms for 50 cent, just to pay my rent
I had no will to ill, my mind was out to kill
I called up Kurt, got a ??? signed with Capitol
Money's flowin' now wild suckas out blowin' up
They my pupic care, and pupils still growin' up
Sucking mean while the g'ism as it hits the rhythm
They want that new style, no money it's called freestyle
Taping of the radio, smokin' from a crackvowel
They on my tip now, as always as usual
You forgot me, but I didn't forget you

You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again

Dan Voye,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

[Chorus]",Sometimes I'm Happy
Dan Weiner,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Dan Willis,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You

And to the gold eye of what is possible

All the oracles of fate end
When our honesties are hanging on the wall
And I asked the page for end

It's you and me against history
It doesn't have to be the way it's always been
You and me against history
We'll never let it be that way again

Sell off all of your old lives
All of the cold lies and get impossible
Oh, sell off all the no ones
We'll never be done and get impossible

When tomorrow comes we'll say it after all
All the monitors are ringing
When the cold day comes we'll be there on the lawn
Now another world's beginning

It's you and me against history
It doesn't have to be the way it's always been
You and me against history
We'll never gonna be the same as them

And all of the days of my life I want
Like the towers of the telephone line
Alongside the interstate

And either direction is far from home
The stars make a line leading from the road
And I am an arrow that knows where to go

It's you and me against history
It doesn't have to be
It doesn't have to be the way it's always been
Me against history
We'll never, never, never, never be the same as them

Dan Wilson,"Baby doll, you've been lonely I've been out of town
Play me unintended, circus clown
Looking for a someone just like you, girl

But now the stars are going out
An old familiar house are falling off the grid
I wanna get back on your list and resurrect the things we did

Baby doll, I've been circling the whole world 'round
Trying to find the ones who stole my sound
So I could bring it back to you, girl

You'll be stashed and sad, and I'll be purring like a kitty cat
And you won't sit in silence like you do
Then you can tell me I'm the only one you make love to me too

And I don't want to love, no one else to love
No one else to love, no one else
And I don't want to love, no one else to love
No, I only wanna love my baby doll

Baby doll, I've been knotting candles into wings
So I can fly up high and buy a things
Diamond rings and pretty horses too

It's much less than you deserve but if I don't I'm guessing
I won't get the chance to make amends
While I'm paying you be and the ladies
Making contact with your friends then you'll disappear again

And I don't want to lose, no one else to lose
No one else to lose, no one else
And I don't want to lose, no one else to lose
No, I only wanna lose my baby doll

When I saw you laughing, you would shine like the sun
And reflected in your life, I would shine like the one

And I don't want to love, no one else to love
No one else to love, no one else
And I don't want to love, no one else to love
No, I only wanna love my baby doll

Dan Wilson,"I'm hunting shadows in the dark
In steaming jungles of the world
Either to kill or to be killed
By creatures never named or heard

I'm lifting wishes to the stars
The gleaming satellites of time
Orbiting circles overhead
To futures when your love is mine

But you were always pretty reckless with your love
Come with the sun and get it restless when it's gone
And when you go you'll leave me breathless and alone

You leave me breathless, when you close the door
It feels just like you took the air out of the room with you

Your voice is echoing again
Through catacombs inside my mind
And I've been dreaming of revenge
To make you love me more than even you can try

All words converge to where you are
And if I follow I would surely find
The horse is gone, the fire's still warm
And you've moved on an hour before
You like to keep me just one step behind

And you were always pretty reckless with your love
Come with the sun and get it restless when it's gone
And when you go you'll leave me breathless and alone

You leave me breathless, when you close the door
It feels just like you took the air out of the room with you
Breathless, breathless, breathless, breathless

Yeah, you were always pretty reckless with your love
Come with the sun and get it restless when it's gone
And when you go you'll leave me breathless and alone

Will stay with me forever and ever and ever
Too good, you're too perfect for this world
A visitor, I wonder if you're from somewhere better

Dan Wilson,"One more long and lonely night, left here on my own
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?
I lost my baby in the fight, I don't know where you've gone
Do you wanna make we wanna cry?

So I lie alone and I wonder where you've gone
And I dream you're mine wide awake

Don't you wanna make me feel like I'm a thousand stories high?
Don't you wanna make me feel I'll never fail, I'll never die?
Don't you wanna set me free, we'll override the history
Turn to find our destiny and never turn away

The devil was an angel once beautiful like you
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?
I don't care how far you fall, I'll catch you when you do
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?

So I close my eyes try to hold my head up high
And I pray my soul not to break

Are warning us to back away
They form commissions trying to find
The next one they can crucify

And anger plays on every station

It's way beyond the strip, a place they call your soul
We'll sit down for a while and let the evening roll

Don't worry about the time, we'll find a place to stay
The people 'round here seem familiar in some way
Look kind of like we did before we got so cold

And in the air the questions hang
Will we get to do something?
Who we gonna end up being?
How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on? Free life

Let's fall in love again with music as our guide
We'll raise our ready hands and let go for the ride
Down into unknown lands where lovers need and hide

We got these lives for free, we don't know where they've been
We don't know where they'll go when we are through with them
A starlight of the sun, the dark side of the moon

In the air the questions hang
Will we get to do something?
Who we gonna end up being?
How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?
Free life, free life, free life

It seems so long ago, those empty afternoon
With nowhere much to go and nothing much to do
But sit up in my room and let the world unfold

Will we get to do something?
Who we gonna end up being?
How we gonna end up feeling?

Reaching over so many years to me
Oh my, I hear a voice in my head

Just before she had to leave to catch a plane
Ten thousand miles from lakes that I played in
But I was laughing like a little boy again

It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

[ INTRO ]
Full-circle, 360 degrees Dane
My style will live forever, my fame will be maintained
Now some can't feel this, and some feel can't that
But all can feel a track that's produced by Battlecat
So gather round and listen to my non-fiction
The picture will come clearer than a Sony television
This ain't about dissin, this is all fact
Women on my nuts cause my vocals makin cash

[ CHORUS ]
	(The Rapper Dana Dane, what time is it?)
	She's on the record's jock, she doesn't love me
	(The Great Dana Dane, what time is it?)
	She's just stressin my fame and my money

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm bustin this one for Bridget, the hoe
I met at the Emmaco pumpin the petrol into her five point o
I wanted her because she looked like Janet Jackson
Caramel complexion, sportin sexy fashion
""Hello, how you're doin?"" I said, ""they call me Dane""
""I could learn to love your flavor, hon, hey, what's your name?""
She had nothin for me, totally ignored me
High-sided, took it like she never saw me - cool
So I tried again: ""What up! How you're feelin?""
Was a hot and humid day, but I felt a cold chill
I figured, let me step before I have to diss her
That's when I overheard her girlfriend try to whisper
(Oh, I know him from somehwere - oh, that's Dana Dane!
I saw him last week, he performed on _Soul Train_)
Now honey flipped the script like Sybill
""You're not the Rapper Dana Dane with fame, is you?
Ooh, I like your records, ooh, you're the man
Ooh, you're so fine, I'm your number one fan""
Now she knows that I'm the Dane, all of a sudden I'm accepted
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Next I peeped this honey at the bar scopin the Dane hard
Loud, money proud, yo, I knew her hoe card
Native New Yorker, Brooklyn fast-talker
Big jewelry-sporter, sippin Johnny Walker
She bought me this drink, she's flashin her cash
She passin me hints like she want to give me the ass
I avoided her because I knew her man Pedro
She said (Dana, fuck him, let's talk about your stage show!)
You ??? well, there ain't no brother brother
Hands on my pants, woulda yoked it if I let her
She was gettin tippsy, dancin like a gypsy
Seen her before, but never knew she was this frisky
Tried to break lips, but she wasn't tryin to have it
Playin me close like ??? metal to a magnet
Then she shouted: ""Dane, I can't wait to get you naked!""
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now last but not least, let me tell you 'bout Judy
Baaya with the tattas, booya with the booty
A cutie with a juicy fat coochie
Felt it was my duty to make her sing like Suzy
??? 'Cha-ya-ya-ya...' - recall the flavor?
>From the first album that the Dane ever gave ya
Anyway, no more delay, she was a hard nut to crack
Kicked the rap like a mack, but she wouldn't give me jack
But still she's in my grill everytime that she sees me
Askin (When you're comin with that new fat release?)
Well, I seen her 'bout a weak about, I told her 'bout a week or so
""Wouldn't you like to be in Dana Dane's video?""
Now she started clickin, dissed her in addition
Comin to my crib for the private audition
Again the same game, just a different scenario
Ridin on my nuts to play a part in my video
Must be the music
That's makin her flip
Must be the music
Must be the music

Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Now Bedie was this girl I graduated from high school with
You know, the type of girl that everybody is real cool with
She didn't smoke or drink, in fact she never ever cursed
She wore the rosary beeds and kept a Bible in her purse
Well, one day she was aligned waiting to get in a night club
Some major group was playing, and everybody was real hyped up
Now Bedie wasn't assort to go to parties of that type
And I couldn't help but wonder why she had came here tonight
Now I didn't ask any questions, I went inside and got a drink
Someone tapped me on my shoulder (Hm, who could it be?) Now let me think
I looked around, and there was Bedie, all dressed up in lace and leather
Boy, I must admit, she really had her act together

Bedie Boo 
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while
Until it gets around
Oh-oh-oh Bedie Boo

(Hello, remember me?) I said, ""Oh yes, of course I do
You're the girl from science class that I used to sit next to""
She started givin hints like she wanted me to hit it
(Was you with it?) Well, you know.. (Yo, was you with it?) Yeah, I was with it!
I led her to this room, the door said 'V.I.P.'
Only for people with juice, and of course that meant me
I said, ""Gosh, how you changed, Bedie, you sure look, different""
(But you said she was religious) I can see now that she isn't
She got on her knees and started reachin for my zipper
I sang this little song right before, you know, I did her

Bedie Boo 
You used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now

I can't expect the whole world to stop turning just to listen to me
Besides everybody thinks that a women has got something to say
It's the way it's been it's always been the way

It's a really fine feeling when I'm dreaming of a rainy day
Cause I can hear the words I just can't feel the soul
Said the tides aren't turning but nothing ever seems to change
When I turn the dial the grief still feels the same

Well I guess it's just the way it's got to be
Whose to say I'm the only one living in reality
But there's a melody I'm singing keeps me feeling like a never belong
I'll just sit right here and think all the way

Is anybody feeling what I'm feeling on the radio
Cause I can hear the words but I cant feel the soul
Said the tides aren't turning but nothing ever seems to change
When I turn the dial the groove still feels the same

Well I guess it's just the way, that things will have to be yea

Well what if I could just live in that wonderland

Aretha sings about a do right man all night long just for me
That would be the way that it would be

Than what we have to give.

When summer turns to winter storm.

When a dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside
You know we never know why

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong

I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right that I defend
Over and over again

With you eternally mine

No measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I
Live in each other's hearts

We may be oceans away

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior

Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for

Dana Lyons,"Fat and docile, big and dumb
They look so stupid, they aren't much fun
Cows aren't fun

They eat to grow, grow to die
Die to be et at the hamburger fry
Cows well done

Nobody thunk it, nobody knew
No one imagined the great cow guru
Cows are one

He hid in the forest, read books with great zeal
He loved Che Guevera, a revolutionary veal
Cow Tse Tongue

He spoke about justice, but nobody stirred
He felt like an outcast, alone in the herd
Cow doldrums

He mooed we must fight, escape or we'll die
Cows gathered around, cause the steaks were so high

Bad cow pun

But then he was captured, stuffed into a crate
Loaded onto a truck, where he rode to his fate
Cows are bummed

He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy
No one suspected he was packing an Uzi
Cows with guns

They came with a needle to stick in his thigh
He kicked for the groin, he pissed in their eye
Cow well hung

Knocked over a tractor and ran for the door
Six gallons of gas flowed out on the floor
Run cows run!

He picked up a bullhorn and jumped up on the hay
We are free roving bovines, we run free today

We will fight for bovine freedom    
And hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die
Cows with guns

They crashed the gate in a great stampede
Tipped over a milk truck, torched all the feed
Cows have fun

Sixty police cars were piled in a heap
Covered in cow pies, covered up deep
Much cow dung

Black smoke rising, darkening the day
Twelve burning McDonalds, have it your way

We will fight for bovine freedom    
And hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die
Cows with guns

The President said ""enough is enough
These uppity cattle, its time to get tough""
Cow dung flung

The newspapers gloated, folks sighed with relief
Tomorrow at noon, they would all be ground beef
Cows on buns

The cows were surrounded, they waited and prayed
They mooed their last moos, 
they chewed their last hay
Cows outgunned

The order was given to turn cows to whoppers

Enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers
But on the horizon surrounding the shoppers
Came the deafening roar of chickens in choppers

We will fight for bovine freedom    
And [E]hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die

To let you down again

Dana Parish,"The river is wide
It opens up its arms and holds you just like a child
The river is wise
It tells you where to go, it shows you which way to fly

You don't know where it all went wrong
Was a miracle just supposed to fall?
Stop your running and look behind you
A minute goes by and the river runs dry
The river runs dry

The river is deep
It holds onto the secrets we all try to keep
And time never slows
You can see your reflection and then away it goes

You don't know where it all went wrong
Was a miracle just supposed to fall?
Stop your running and look behind you
A minute goes by and the river runs dry
The river runs dry

It was beautiful but you worried it away
It was nothin' but a warm summer day

The river is long
All you gotta do is listen to hear her song

You don't know where it all went wrong
Was a miracle just supposed to fall?
Stop your running and look behind you
A minute goes by and the river runs dry
The river runs dry

Dana Parish,"The hour glass is lying down
And I just stare and wonder how
It came to this, it came to this

Meet me on the subway train
Just hold my hand and say my name
It doesn't matter if you know me
Just reach out and try to show me

How did we fall down?
We never knew what pulled us through
Somehow we stay in an empty place
But we wanna fill the page, turn it around
But we fall down, we fall down

The radio keeps me awake
I pray for all of my mistakes
Another week that I don't sleep

Meet me in the parking lot
Yeah, I'll be in the same old spot
You always know where you can find me
When you get here please remind me

How did we fall down?
We never knew what pulled us through
Somehow we stay in an empty place
But we wanna fill the page, turn it around
But we fall down, we fall down

How did we fall down?
We never knew what pulled us through
Somehow we stay in an empty place
But we wanna fill the page, turn it around

Dana Pomfret,"Though you've played at love and lost
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will melt your heart again
Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time you felt like you did then
There's just no percentage in remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again at last

Come with me
Leave yesterday behind
And take a giant step 
Outside your mind

You stare at me in disbelief
You say for you there's no relief
But I swear I'll prove you wrong
Don't stay here in your lonely room
Just looking back at silent gloom
That's not where you belong

And every day holds wonders to be seen",Take a Giant Step

Dana Winner,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Y yo no creo que vuelva a amar otra vez 
Ni que me entregue como a ti me entregué

Y grito en el vacío una armonía sin voz 
Cada vez que miro hacía el cielo 
Y no veo la luna yo no tengo consuelo

En nadie lo vas a encontrar que te importa como vivan 
Yo vivo adelante mi vida 
Y aunque no quieras yo voy a cantar 
Aah aah que pena me das 

Yo soy individual, y eso no va a cambiar mientras pueda pensar 
Individual y me gusta el blues y me gusta el rock y me gusta el rap 
Individual y me gusta el reggae y me gusta el punk y me gusta el jazz 
Individual y eso no va a cambiar, no",Individual
Danay Suarez,"Oh, no 
No existen palabras

Cuando la confianza se pierde no solo se pierde la confianza 
Lo mas grande se pierde 
Cuando las mentiras te duermen 
No existen palabras que te vuelvan a hacer fuertes
No

Te hizo sentir lo único en su vida, lo mas importante 
La modelo preferida de la alfombra de su corazón 
Su mas grande canción, en el amor la principiante 
Puso un anillo en tu dedo y su alma en su colchón 
Te hizo sentir la mas inteligente, la mas decente 
Te garantizo fidelidad por siempre 
Te hizo mirar al frente,sin miedo a la gente 
Te hizo una mujer segura, grande y fuerte 
Llena de esperanzas, pero, eh 
No solo se pierde la confianza 
Lo mas grande se pierde
Cuando las mentiras te duermen 
No existen palabras, no 
Que te vuelvan a hacer fuertes 
No

Lagrimas, lagrima
Lagrimas caen 
Cuando nadie las ve
Es bueno disimular, nadie se debe enterar 
Que estas llorando otra vez 

Todavía quedan restos de humedad 
Un corazón nuevo reemplaza al viejo que esta cansado de luchar 
Contra lo poco de humano que existe en la humanidad 
Donde una blusa escotada borra un amor de verdad 

Una foto al descuido que nunca valió nada 
Y una carta.. Mal redactada 
Puede dejarte viviendo en el dolor y sin valor
Hablando con la soledad, ah
(cuando la confianza se pierde, lo mas grande se pierde) 
Tu no sospechas cuando me estas mirando 
Que cuando las, mentiras te duermen
No existen palabreras que te vuelvan a hacer fuertes 
Lagrimas, lagrimas,lagrimas caen, caen 
Lagrimas, lagrimas caen (bis)

No existen palabras 

Cuando la confianza se pierde no solo se pierde la confianza 
Lo mas grande se pierde 
Cuando las mentiras te duermen 
No existen palabras que te vuelvan a hacer fuertes

Es cualquiera que se pierde en su mismo sistema

Un poco revolucionaria que me alborota la aldea

Tengo que educar a mis chamacos y cómprales zapatos

Danay Suarez,"Yo aprendí que la mayoría de las veces
Las cosas no son lo que parecen 
Que somos una especie, que se especializa en mentir 
Para así construir un porvenir con mentiras 
Cuenta cuantas veces hacemos desaparecer 
Con solo una frase lo que no quisiéramos perder 
Se nos va la vida, estamos dejando correr 
El tren con el amor, que solo pasa una vez 
Yo aprendí a no burlarme de nadie con arrogancia 
Por que yo no se cuales serán mis circunstancias 
Y la elegancia, solo es cosa de ego 
La ropa con la que mejor me veo
Es la del alma

Yo aprendí que la karma es buena consejera
A la hora de tomar decisiones certeras 
Que yo no soy la maldita
Pero con el oportunista debo ser una fiera
Yo se que uno se puede equivocar
Como un ser humano normal 
Que tiene mucho valor que de perdones 
Pero mas perdonar 
Que no se puede pisotear la palabra 
Pisotear la moral 
Que el amor no basta cuando el respeto no alcanza 
Es como arar en el mar

No soy mejor que nadie, nadie es mejor que yo 
Aunque yo no entienda como todos quieren parecerse
Como la gente se clona, pierde su propia voz 
Y no saben a donde caminar al levantarse 
Yo aprendí que el querer saber todo lo que piensan con respecto a mi 
Es se-mi amenaza, es abrirle la puerta 
A la envidia, decirle ""¿Como esta señora? 
Entre esta en su casa"" 
Que pasan las cosas, pero los errores pesan 
Por que luego se arrastran, por que luego te aplastan, como cadenas del alma
Yo se como se extrañar a un hermano 
Cuando te hace falta

Yo se que a veces el que mas sufre 
Es el que mas te ama
Yo se que tendré otra madrugada donde no tenga ni almohada
Ya yo comprendí que la vida es linda, pero no es un cuento de hadas
Yo se que uno se puede equivocar
Como un ser humano normal

Pero no permito que quieras manipularme

Te podría agradecer un consejo a mi favor

Si no existiera uso de poder 
Si existiera hacía donde correr 
Si se respetara el trabajo de los demás 
Si solo dependiera de mí y de mis deseos de crear y de hacer
Pero quien eres tu para escucharme y yo para cambiar lo que está mal 
La comprensión de tí la espero lejos 
Por que tu no estás en mi pellejo 
Pero si hay una cosa que aprendí 
Es el no sobornar mi identidad 
Por que yo soy individual

If you read my texts one more time!

If you fill the pageant bowl I will be masterful
Well full of liquid comedy, namaste, your baller bag is on its way
Red full of lexicons, polishing megatron

The lions den of I'm akin, to sleeping late and eating wrong
Well If I ever got it straight, I think id bend at every pause
The action leaking out my face, from breathing paint to missing calls

Well I'm the sugar-coated tooth, and I have come to ruin your mood
While staring at the frozen foot, I realized I'm stupid too
Well Farming isn't fun at all, and I will build a thousand malls
And eat the food courts flesh, from every single city

Before you ask what you think you want to know
Take a look at my face and how far you think I'll go
Because I've had it up to here for the 37th time this year
And I've kept it bottled down
But not this time, not here
'Cause I'm fucking on one
Shave it out, you need a break from hair
Coming out bald, I'm the eagle in the air
With the big ass braids and the folding chair
Just shave it out, you need a break from hair

Heart is beating Heavy breathing
Can't stop it when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder It's taking over

Shed my disguise I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to
Keep it alive

There were only two things you despised
The first was a coward
And the second one was a liar

Forgot to add hypocrite to your little list

""You'd look great on my yacht,"" was the best line that he had.

Everything was hidden by all the greasy hair he was in
Never looking up, he seemed so sad I tried to offer him
My shot of whiskey but he said I only drink gin

He smiled whistfully, his shirt was dirty and torn
Everlasting glances like open-ended chances
But he stole my heart when he ordered a double for me

His hands were in my bad, red-handed guilt everywhere
Took out a photo of an old Romeo
Threw it over his shoulder and rested his hand on my knee
We played these games where we go through the whole alphabet
He's have an Adam & Eve and I had a Dixie Julep
Went through an Artillery, Caruso, and a Diamond Fizz
Fallen Angel, Green Dragon, ending with a kiss in the dark

Took pills and whiskey just to ease my pain

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Darling you've got full control of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet

Your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet

Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet an you hold my string, I'm your puppet

Walking, talking, living, loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string, I'll do anything now

I'm a walking, talking, living, loving puppet, and I love you",I'm Your Puppet
Dandy Livingstone,"There was a girl, there was a boy
If they had met they might have found a world of joy
But she lived on the morning side of the mountain
And he lived on the twilight side of the hill

They never met, they never kissed
And they will never know what happiness they missed
For she lived on the morning side of the mountain
And he lived on the twilight side of the hill

For love's a rose that never grows
Without the kiss of the morning dew
And every Jack must have a Jill
To know the thrill of a dream that comes true

And you and I are just like they
For all we know our love is just a kiss away
But you are on the morning side of the mountain
And I am on the twilight side of the hill

For love's a rose that never grows
Without the kiss of the morning dew
And every Jack must have a Jill

Dandy Livingstone,"Last night as I got home about a half past ten
There was the woman I thought I knew
In the arms of another man
I kept my cool, I ain't no fool
Let me tell you what happened then
I packed some clothes and I walked out
And I ain't going back again

[CHORUS:]
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life
You've been many things but most of all a good secretary to me
And it's times like this I feel you've always been close to me
Was I wrong to work nights to try to build a good life
All work and no play has just cost me a wife

[CHORUS]

When a man loves a woman it's hard to understand
That she would find more pleasure in the arms of another man
I never really noticed how sweet you are to me
It just so happens I'm free tonight
Would you like to have dinner with me

Dane Cook,"There are some things I have learned in my recent past
That I'm excited to share with you tonight
And one thing I've realized is that we all want to leave
Behind a legacy
We all want to be remembered for something
And then I was thinking going, how can I be remembered
And then I suddenly realized you can do it on a daily
Bases
Even if it?s one on one with people
For example, the other day, I saw a young boy
And he was eating an ice cream cone
I ran up and I smashed it into his face

I leaned in, I go, you remember me forever and I ran away
Cause you know when he's 50, he's gonna be like
One day a man ran up to me, I did not know this man
He smashed my treat into my eyes. And he pointed and said
""You fuckin remember me forever.""?
But I did not say fuckin, I did not say that.
He added fuckin to make the story more intense and
Interesting.
He deserves to have ice cream smashed in his face,
Cause he?s a lying 50 year old man. I did NOT say fuckin.",Legacy

Just a sweet young girl in a knockdown world, such a pity
Well she never worried, growin' up in a hurry
No one showed her the right
She met a man, he took her hand one night

Out on the street all the people you meet
Wanna use you for your innocent ways
Running around you're the talk of the town today

You were so cool you played by the rules
You thought you had it in the palm of your hand
You're on your way to the top and
They won't let you stop till you're there

Now you're under the gun out on the run
Paying the price with your flesh and your blood
It's bringing you down, bringing you down
Livin' your life under the gun

Under the lights, you're feelin' the bite
Of big city days and big city nights
Now you're alone, you wanna go home, but you can't

You're goin' out of your head, they're in and out of your bed
You're losin' sight of what you thought was the truth
They'll string you along till you're tattered and torn
Then along comes somebody new

When you're under the gun out on the run
Paying the price with your flesh and your blood
It’s bringing you down, bringing you down
Livin' your life under the gun

You were on the top but now
You're runnin' out of time

Money, that and
I wanna get some steady bitches and hoes
And some candy for my nerves
Some diamond stones, to roll with my chrome and

Hey, genius, you even know what that means?
Uh, uh, what does it mean?
Where's the keyboards and the tambourine and the guitar
And you know, I mean, the stuff that like white people like

He mostly only turned into a frank or a igloo

Switch your view to the brother with the fried dreads
Not to be confused with the incense selling Thai heads
His name rhymes with Mike Cock
You could call him livewire, eye sockets, Frylock

Able to shoot electricity through his eyeballs
And blast all through your single sided brick and drywall
More interesting than professional wrestling
When he's online you can find him on instant pestering

What's up with your boy? He's not a soft or hot drink
Whoever don't like it could suck his straw, it's hot pink
On some junk like Gucci on a classy ho
Might splash you in the face with nuclear pistachio

Before everybody and they mother rhyme
What a crime - beats is the same way

Drag on the suede from the gem drop of well spit

In the pissy wind, is this thing whistling?
Who let the spinning whispering jinn in?

That's his name, don't play it out
Or spray it, when you say it out your mouth
Then gave him a cold shoulder for a hour
And told him take a gold shower, for faking funk, soul power
Stocky, short and cocky
Looked like Apollo Creed after he fought with Rocky
Rhymed in a broken English slang, not cockney
Thirteen, his first queen wore hot knock knees
Had to tell her pops, yo stop cock blocking 'B'	
Hold something for your daily 'ya' habit
Then go, bada-bing-bing-bing like ricochet rabbit
How 'bout the sicko say stab it?
There's liquor in the cabinet and a slicker for the crafted
And Heineken, I told him much obliged friend
What I gotta spend, if I only touch her thighs then?
Why his eyes widened
He didn't know your man had a nice surprise hiding
Took pride in riding in a sly wise guy grin

Real recognize real
On the microphone, the wheels are mechanized steel
Please, at least respect your ideals
How you got her walking along the stroll in high heels?

He said her mama was getting old
God bless her poor soul, now no more drama is your role
Straight to the head
He know a lot of haters can't wait 'til he dead
Lead to go, like a ho, to a strange whack housewife
Only thing he know will change his back do', how trife
Rules is rules, don't go there
Stay on sale like a old coat made of mohair
Keep a snotty chicken on E, the Lone Ranger
Why everybody always picking on Danger?

And Doom, maybe it's him
Called up my lady, told her baby it's slim
Make me up a margarita I need to take a swim
Tell them kids remember school - if they let them out, cool
But get the hell from out the pool

Danger Doom,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we all lived through the 70's
The clothes, the music, the heartwarming but rarely amusing Ziggy cartoons
Now, later, who are we to look at these two, fine young men
And say, ""You there - I sit in judgment of you!""

For being a drunken lush, and bad as hell
Read the charge and thunk, sunk in in a plush padded cell
Temperpedic Craftmatic adjustable
Go on try to stare at it, it's not that combustible
I accidentally split some kerosene
And dozed off with the L lit, doped up on thorazine
Matter of fact, make mines a double
Few could see the point like a line through the Hubble
Doom hit the eye in the sky with a pie
Shrink said he thinks he believe he could fly
Spread his wings and flap like a goose
He'll show you how to do it if you help him get the straps loose
Diagnosed as shell shocked from totin toast
And still could hear the bells rock Doc, another loading dose
He claimed he couldn't take the racket
Faked his own escape in a eightball straight jacket

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
This, animal, here; this ursine fellow
Unclean!
He rejected society and retreated
To a cave in the woods to plot his vile - nod!

And it isn't true that at these times
He often descends into a delusional state
Sometimes actually adopting another person's persona?

I started punchin' once I saw son lungin'
He had me put on punishment for eating the last Munchkin
So now they got me down here near the dungeon
Nurses all arguin' over who's to do the spongin'
He requested time off for bugged behavior
And rhymed off of thug beats bumped by a neighbor
Who spoke with his fist and kept a mirror with a thumbhole
Cell twelve drumroll, ode to a gum sole
A O.G. like a captain that's retired
Rappers is space cadets yappin' be quiet
And that's an order ship your daughters to my quarters at once
And don't sip the tap water dunce
He is the super, a stranger who talks to you
Maybe even offer tech support and walk you through
Villain, man in the mask, spit in the face
Show him where to go, inside a hand basket case

The defendant's confession!

Uh, nothing further

Mentok commands you to proceed, with your case!

Just since some people, wear a mask
Don't mean.. they.. did nothing automatically

Now wait a second!
Your Honor I'd respectfully like to have a word with you in chambers

I request an immediate dismissal, on the grounds
On grounds that

And kept the pen and a pencil in his mental den
Right there, next to where the Rolodex was
Before it turned up all burnt by his solar plexus
He don't know his own strength, when he's on the bone
It's like the microphones length, and width, ain't it funky like dingy socks?

The super flow with more jokes than Bazooka Joe
A mix between Superfly Snuka and a superhoe
Chew a MC like El Chupa Nibre
Digest a group and sell the poop on eBay

Danger with the vest screamin ""Shoot the DJ!""
Doom clickin over two chickens, three-way
Four in the 5, a cork on the freeway
Villain find a way to make 'em pay whatever we say

State your intentions
""I really love your tape but I hate your inventions""
Very well, what you want, a brownie?
He took off the mask and whispered ""Put me where you found me""

He kept his paper digits in a chunk
Once joined a rap click, midgets into crunk
He did a solo on the oboe
Coulda sold a million then the Villain went for dolo

And cited creative differences
Basically they hated, he left no jaded witnesses
Rappers suck, when they spit I doubt 'em
The crap they sing about you'll wanna slap the fuckin' shit out 'em

Psht - time waits for no man
On a blind date, a love with a slow chrome hand
Judged him by his shoes, hot smelly Brogan
Budged him with the news, called him pot-bellied Conan

No prick barbarian
A strict bear-atarian, a sick pair of merry men
The beat is like a swift kick in the rear end
The stiff dick made her lose her lipstick and hairpin

He said ""Djamn! Act like you know me
Even with the mask on, show me what you owe me""
Tell her brush her grill and wash her face and pussy, homey
Dumile got her like Inuyasha got Kagome

What we have here is a failure to communicate
If you gonna hate, might at least get your rumors straight
About Doom the Great, a lot more confident
Came a long way since the days we had to rhyme for rent

It was time well spent, vented
Spelt and dented, hell-bented and heaven-scented
A wire is dead, he's in it for the cash flow
I'd like to send a big up to Firehead Lazzo

Let a brother know once you lasso Hasbro
So when he come with Destro he gets no hassle
Could hardly get a word in and
Wonderin what the damage is to retain Harvey Birdman?",El Chupa Nibre
Danger Doom,"Head on straight, mask on crooked
Exit stage left with the cash, gone took it
Off like a koufi, the fit was a bit doofy
He tried to get screwy, with that ""two for you,
One, two for me, G,"" cut the cranky attitude
Wet him like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude
Whether you's a rapper or dang sanger
Once you in the zone only one way out, like a gang banger
With a new crew keychain and street name
What set do he claim for fame, peep game
Just to keep feta and stay dip
You need it like a letter or better a getaway whip
This old things rusted, encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted
Plan to end global starvation and fat her
Now what in tarnation did I go and do that fer?
Stuff happens, like gettin' snuffed for tough tit rappin'
See, I told 'em enough, quit yer yappin'
The same applied to any and all chumps
The only question he had for y'all is how many lumps?
Three or four? either or? mon cheri amour
See, why you need your heater for?
The super villain slid in your party for free
Warn a emcee, get outta here kid, you bother me!

The day I took my mask off my face was missin' for two days
For the record, G, came back a year later, whole new identity
Tony Starks pedigree, my money green like my nickname was celery
Who is Ghost who flashes toast, never wore sheets but bulletproof coats
Oh no! the fans cry for the mask back on
Told 'em ""Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn""
Few years from now, him and his pals before the Jetson-era arrived
He'll be back summertime, 2000 and 5, with a half a face iron
The other half water look like alien science
In the summertime, you can see the face boil
But the other side I keep blue with the Penzoil
Mad loyal, when the wintertime come, (what?)
I get stuck 'cause my brain all numb
Like I ate a thousand icee's and frozen Pepsi's
Aquaman's pops can't water-check me, disrespect me, indirectly
I seen his feet and they both lefty, he's steppin' half correctly
As I stroll the globe and terrorize the planet
With a Bill Clinton mask and them Playskool hammers
Me and DOOM, always be the best on the landin'
Superhero's for life, until our souls vanish",The Mask
Danger Doom,"Well, Debbie thinks this is all about her biological clock
And I...

She stopped screaming long enough to tell you that?

Huh? No no no no, no, the other Debbie
Debbie the teacher?

Oh, you mean... Black Debbie

Whoa whoa whoa whoa, why is she ""Black"" Debbie?

No, not in a bad way
It's just to tell them apart because she's... black!

True, Doom rolled on through with a whole crew
That stole on you for holding old brew, who told you?
Even if it's crap, mind your own business
They raps ain't got no gift like a lonely Christmas
Real phony with beats that's hardly fresh
How they manage to deal is anybody's guess
Yours is as good as mine, she's sure fine
From the hood where you squeeze your nine off the free cheese line
All you saw was a do a bee's line
To where she stood and sipped the Nehi Grape, the sweet kind
Circle you, thicker by de-sign
Be-hind swingin like bring it back, come rewind
Uhh, excuse me boo
She stuck out her tongue, it was purple number two
FDA approved played it smoother than a doo rag
What a brother gotta do to get a taste a some of you?
Bagged, and he don't mean coach
Then she saw the mask, acted like she seen a roach
The mirror shine reflect colors like your CD's
Show love to others, we all brothers like the Bee Gees
All except the broads and you
Hold your applause, they break God's laws and who pays?
The taxpayer that's who
Catch a rapper by his toe and smack off his tattoos
That's gonna leave a bruise
Leave 'em grievin blues like believin in evening news
They must be eatin glue
Heave it all back, and we even Steven Sue
Sprinkle lyrics like seasoning beef stew
And sneezin all in it after breathin in the flu
Get a clue, his reasoning is askew
As to all the feverin and heavin up goo
Either that or... dude
Leave your girl around this man whore and she's too screwed
Just in case she's in a ""what you wanna do"" mood
Bring your plate to the Metal Face and get your food chewed
? tastes like chicken
He wastes no time like the bassline kickin in
Or like a lace eye with you through thick and thin
Raw humor, face pie to a frickin chin
New York'n, a hell of a finer town
Choose your words wisely from the Boogie Down to Chinatown
Or be found with a hole in your designer gown
In the role of public opinion it earned a minor frown
If you think you're slick, you might could wish, but uhh
As a few good men set sights to link with your chick
You have to find a new hen fight to drink your liq'
Ten years later, see how Enzyte'll shrink your... wallet
As you wallow in a sorrow pit
Cheers, is that your beer kid? Then swallow it
Or get chased by the Sandman, on some Apollo
Flow so weird, his own peers couldn't follow it
On the phone, he sounded like a real paid
Then we met in person, he was three shades blacker
That's why he saved money over ball and chain dames
We all the same, no callin names

I'm as smart as him!

What? I got Ph.D's in four scientific disciplines

Really?

Why do you think they call me Dr. Quinn?

Um, I just thought that was a nickname
You know, like Dr. Dre

Danger Doom,"One two three, in the place to be!
MF Doom, Talib Kweli, ah here we go
On born days, I used to blow out the candles; and every Saturday
Watch cartoons 'til noon and then I'd switch to Ralph McDaniels
I was, makin up a miracle flow, over a cereal bowl
And a paused beat from my stereo
Rhymes stronger than Popeye with the spinach
Yeah I'm gangster like the frog on Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse
Maybe I'm trippin and it's just a cartoon to you
But I got chills when I heard how Doom flipped the Scooby Doo
And, I might be buggin but it seem to me
That cartoons be realer than reality TV
They inspire my decision to be open and listen
But folks got it all twisted, like a yoga position
Like, in order to spit it dope, you gotta have a criminal past
That's similar to the cast of Different Strokes
Me and my people break bread, sit and smoke
The conversation rich, but that depend on what you consider broke
I draw on anything for inspiration
A fond memory, a piece of paper, walls in a train station

It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
(I'm old school y'all, yes y'all, I keep it goin y'all, here we go)
It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that

It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
(Ah here we go, c'mon)

And we'll be right back after these messages
Fellas grab your nutsacs, chicks squeeze your breastesses
We ain't all that grown, it's still funny like
Goin to the store on your own with rainbow money
Since then had an insane flow sonny
Walkin to the corner rhymin in the rain, nose runny
Breakdancin maybe ten, bummy
Is when Subroc would run up handspring Arabian somee!
Ooh wee, like a Hong Kong Phooey kick
Or a weekend afternoon, karate movie flick
Slept good, no justice, no peace
Woody kept it hoody, never discussed it with police
Shot the fair one nobody ran to get the gat
Or felt they had to put it up in they raps to set it fat
And since when lyrical skills had to do with killin a cat?
What type of chitlins is that?
The Super Villain as the bat, hide your tonic
Whoever willin to ride, provide raw chronic

It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that

Danger Doom,"Perfect hair, to the second power of forever
Ask him do he need it? Hells yeah, now or never
On a mission with friends of fair weather
Sooner the better, off to Mount. Tuna, wear your leather prepared sweater

And watch out for Catman my brothers
He keep his strand slicked back like Scatman Caruthers
A balding boy, sound like Janeane Garofalo
Fiend for a sloppy fro, who seen the evil Coiffio?

Not me yo, I'm leaving, I'm gone
Even if him got them bomb weaving Kalikelon
No more or less stress than your old boss
The tears burn your eyes less than fresh S-curls sores

And Brenda, the best girl lost
Uncle grandfather bare chest was pearl gloss
Earl tossed, there goes a whole tray of hamburgers

Villain 'til they old and grey like olden day scam workers
Circa one nine seventy-one
On the mic machine it seems his work will never be done
He seeks the ninth level of power
But weak geek might freak it in another hour

Or so, they call the fool retarded hair guy
In school you could spot it when he nodded ""Here, why?""
I think his true name was Gerald
The toupee, the male pattern anime herald
A good laugh like the walk to the bank
Not the plank, talk to the hand and the hot frank dog

[Master Shake talking]
Danger Doom it's Master Shake, hey buddy!
Ah did you get those e-mails I sent?
Umm, I'm still waiting, to hear from you
I think, maybe you're, maybe you're in the shower
Do you, are you in the shower? Okay
But I'm still, totally, I got some other stuff
Uhh, but I'm, I am committed more to doing yours
So, if you can let me know, today
That'd, uhh, that'll be great, okay?!
Just, just give me a call! And fa-for the schnizzle
For to do the rap pizzle
And again I'm really sorry, about that other one
The call... Meatwad sucks
Okay, call me back dog!",Perfect Hair
Danger Doom,"Scared of a bunch of water, then get out the rain
Order a rapper for lunch and spit out the chain
Then kick a lungee of the tip of his timbo
And trick a honey dip into a game of of strip limbo
Odd. He couldn't find no remorse
A wink is as good as a nod to a blind horse
Of course his technique was from a divine source
Never knew the price of ice or what swine cost
One guy tried to bite the heat
That's when he discovered the other other white meat
Oh, the one they hate so well
He sure keeps it pyscho like the old bates motel
They came to ask him for a least some new tracks
But only got confronted by the beast with two backs
Knock... Mouse is a made man
Villain laid it down like the best laid plan
Velvet the cat who the hell is that near the middle
Got y'all but it's not all bare and skittles
Prepare the viddles, got riddles and spittles
Crystal clear to the jock or the tittle
TSSSS.. It's hot off the griddle
Came to take the cake whether it's a lot or a little
KABOOM... DOOM is nervous large
You could tell by his Blooming room service charge
Dark and tall to boot
The only thing was wrong was he was bald as a coot
Used to rent a van from Peter Pan to red and tan
And keep the human foot for his dead man's hand
This was when the mask was brand spanking new
Before it got rusted from drinking all the brew
[Sniff] Stankin' too, pew
Kept all his earnings in the bank and his shoe
Spat what he knew, energy for true
To all fake rappers, twenty-three skidoo
Excuse you, any room in the class front?
For a blast of the blunt, shrooming since last month
Doom a human in the mask I'm on the stunt
Danger zooming past mad fast on the hunt
Keep the streets, we got the city needing conquered
Discreetly with the city till they be completely bonkered
The fans demanded it, handled it, swallow it
His own brandishing, if only he could bottle it
Hmm.. Nah she could get messy
Feds tried to tortue him for the secret recipe
He said: It's no use, I only know half
No speake de english. I only do the math
Zzzzz. Felt no pain
His brain was saturated with cocaine and Rogaine
He said: Try scan no thing three-card dead fly man
Go for bling he got bled
I jam over sting, see spots red
I am ""Sofa King, We Todd Ed""",Sofa King

I don't believe this!
I get rid of those two evil maniacs who try to ruin my show
And I get two evil GUESTS who are trying to ruin my show

[Zorak]
FEH!
Just who came up with the stupid idea
Of giving Space Ghost a talk show in the first place?

[MF Doom]
How they gave his own show to Tad Ghostal
Any given second he could go mad postal
Stay wavin that power band space cannon
And have the nerve to jump in the face, of Race Bannon
Punked out; luckily he deaded it
And guess who's the schmuck whose credited with editing it?
Your man Moltar, the cop out
Ain't have no other career choice, he dropped out
Since when the Way-Outs included Zorak
Way back he used to rub his thorax in Borax
{*Zorak laughs*} I'm not the one that sold him to it
If he won't admit it, I'm not gonna hold him to it
It's all love and no hate though
For all that, the Villain need to get his own late show
Do a monologue and jest with the guests
Madlib, switch the beat and walk him to the desk
With Danger holding down the control room
Late again returning from commercial - I told you Doom!
Early, he's on B.P.T.
Catch him on public access free TV
And we're back, live on the air with Brak {""Hey!""}
So Brak, how your man got a show that's so whack? {""What?""}
Have you ever thought to work with Err and Ignignokt an' them?
{*Err laughs*} And do you got enough oxygen from this toxic phlegm?
Another sec', his neck woulda got flames
Mouse switched the screen to some hot dames
Tonight's audience will receive miscreant video games
And fifteen seconds of fame - pitiful lames!
It's just a shame; I'm zonin
Competin for the same prime time slot as Conan
No dummy, Ichigawa
Announcement free lunch to any stunt who lets me plow her
In the shower for an hour, the kids 'sposed to be asleep
Or else to join it sound like Road Runner - BEEP BEEP!
Later this week - Big Ben Klingon
After him there's no one else we could afford to bring on
... Keep it ghetto
And let 'em know, B.Y.O.B. from the get go
[*ahem*] I'd like to propose a toast
To the grossest host, Space Ho's Coast to Coast
That destructo ray's a played out gag
And the cape and the pants suit, lookin like a straight out...
Dag! Don't mean to sound crunchy
Hit a honey from the back and crumpled up her scrunchie
A light snack, hungry munchie
Felt a funny hunch that she told him donkey punch me
Tomorrow it's Father Guido Sarducci
Father MC, and Charo ""Coochie Coochie""
With her new best seller, ""Who You Call a Hoochie?""
A proud sponsor of the snoochie boochie noochies
Look Leela eyeball to eyeballs
And find out how to get inside them sugar pie walls
Our next guest a real cutey specimen
And she's startin to get a little booty, Miss Judy Jetson
So Judy; boxers, briefs or fig leaf?
As you know I wear my boxers so my big...
Cue the rapper tell him bring what little he got
Up against the Villy, it's really not diddly-squat
Until they head hurts - when it come to wreck
Crews is like them dudes in red shirts off Star Trek
He Kirk, he Spock, he McCoy

Born to be the host with the most
When it's on it's on, Space Ho's Coast to Coast

[Space Ghost]
You think I'm just gonna hand over my show to you Doom?
Have you lost your {fucking} mind?
Listen; I'm not gonna hand my show over to you
You know why? Because, it's my show
Mine, not yours - Space Ghost
It ain't ""Doom Coast to Coast""
Yeah, yeah sure, here are the keys to the show

It's not the kind of stuff you want to save and harbor away
Once it gets ripened and fermented

Or this pop, this hot
Or this strong
With so many different flows
This ones for this song
The next one I'll switch up
This one will get bit up
These fucks
To lazy to make up shit
They crazy
They don't, paint pictures
They just trace me
You know what
Soon they forget where they plucked
They whole style from
And try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, tough
I'm not a biter
I'm a writer
For myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough
I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough
Plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about
Bring em out
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth
I'm in, New sneakers
Deuce seaters
Few Diva's
What more can I tell you
Let me spell it for you
W-I-Double L-I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more
New Yorks ambassador
Prime Minister back to finish my business up

You already know what I'm about
Flyin' birds down south
Movin' wet off the step
Purple Rain in the drought
Stunti'n on hoes
Brushin' off my shirt
But ain't nothin' on my clothes
'Cept my chain
My name
Young H-O
Pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol I make payroll
Benz paid for
Friends they roll
Private jets to the Turks and Caicos
Cris' case loads
I don't give a shit
Nigga one life to live I can't let a day go
Bye
Without me being fly
Fresh to death
Head to toe until the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys I'm thirty plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga button ups
S dots on my feet
Make a cipher complete
What more can I say Guru play the beat, I'm livin'

We gonna let this ride into the hook
I'm a snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
Get my grown man on
Let's go
(What more can I say?)

Now you know ass is willie
When they got you in a mag
For like half a billi
And your ass ain't Lilly
White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly
It's both
I don't mean to boast
But damn if I don't brag
Them crackers gonna act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart
That's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student
Just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact I'm just previewin' it
This ain't the show I'm just EQ'in it
One, Two and I won't stop abusin it
To gropie girls stop false accusin it
Back to the music
The mayback roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem Houston
What up B
They can't shut up me
Shut down I
Not even P.E.
I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly
What these streets did to me
So picture me
Lettin' these clowns nit pick at me
And Paint me like a pickiny
I will literally
Kiss Tee-Tee in the forehead
Tell her please forgive me
Then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off
In fact
I got a joint to knock your points off
Young
Hova the God nigga blasphemy
I'm at the Trump International
Ask for me
I ain't never scared
I'm everywhere
You ain't never there
Nigga why would I ever care
Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here
Excluding nobody
Look what I embody
The soul of a hustler I really ran the street
A CEO's mind
That marketing plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated, like say a, Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I supposed to be number one on everybody's list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man

I've got a lyric I can spit so what ya want?
I'm giving bitches good dick so what ya want?
Hey, hey, so what'cha want?
My Ghetto Pop Life hotter than a hot slice
I'm an urban entertainer of the hot nights
I don't wanna see no end because it's not right

I'm just a brother who never
Compromised his integrity
My legacy is heavenly
Bury me in the hood
Never think I'm not cautious, hey
I recognize what a wrong look'll cost us
So inside I'm always nervous
But I never look worried
Come for me
Gun shot flurries in a hurry
Come get me
And be where I perform, stay warm
I'm prepared for the storm
And I brought the heat with me
Lord, please talk to these boys
'Fore I leave they evening spoilt
Put 'em six feet up under the soil
Looking at the roots of trees
Better yet leave they bodies all out in the open so the flies can feed
And when the 'hood get dry I supply the need
Y'all fagot niggas keep it moving honey riding with me
So what ya want?

[Chorus]

And I never politic when I be on some cool out shit
Don't even run up on me talking 'bout some artist that you signed
'Cos I don't really give a fuck and I ain't really got the time
I'm trying to put some money in my clothes
Sean clothes, Jah clothes
First, did you come with six zeros?
Fuck y'all then, I'm trying to put some dubs on the road
Then just slide up in the club and try to bubble some hoes
Player, the harder we grind, the further we go
I'm at the point I'm ready to commit a murder to blow
Whatever it takes, I see the nigga holding the case
Look dead in his face, hit the nigga holding the weight
Make his man take me to the crib and go in the safe
Jah done made the reservation so we ready to peel
For real, without no hesitation Nitty bustin' the steel
So what ya what?

[Chorus]

I'm a O.G in the flesh (true to life)
Giving birth to these young seeds (new to life)
East New York Bed-Stuy nigga (do or die)
I was aiming for his head (it went through his eye)
Pimp nigga, Goldie, Shaft (super fly)
Mixed with a little cheese (from Coolie High)
Mommy how you gonna move? (when it's just you and I)
Pardon me a second dude (you better get in line)
Confrontation time, get in line or spit a rhyme
I ain't looking for no beef but I will oblige
I'm kinda quiet but surprise I ain't really shy
Didn't mean to shock you with the real
But niggas know the deal
When I'm up in punk knockers and down in Sugar Hill
Call me Mr Foreverman, can't say I never ran and never will
But when the shells get to flying and I don't got skill
I get ghost then I bounce
Come back and a nigga be ready to throw toast
So what ya want?

Man, shit be tight nigga ya might need kryptonite

Listen, momma said there'd be days like this
Where I'd have to set the record straight on a plagiarist
Who played the fifth row
Had to let the kid know even if he played the fifth
I'd still get in his ass like a wedgie
Ready or not I be lyrical machete that cut
Through bricks and steel 'cause sticks and stones might
Break ya bones
But they won't end the rhetoric
The evidence is in, I'm guilty
'Cause the verdict is my cleverness with pen
Murder music murder men
The mo' time go by the mo' intense my lyrical flow
To show the privates that they can't follow where generals go
I leave the troops and the battles and the trenches
You succeed with flukes and coincidences
You have no defenses against my sub tenses
I'm all up in the game and you sidelined on the benches
Defenseless against this
From the beginning it was senseless
You bit more than you could chew
It's knocking out your dentures

a bad nigga

I love it when it's my turn
And faces start to look crazy concerned
They know I'm about to burn baby burn
From the facility
The city'll need a lot of H20
When I'm finished you'll need a place to go
Face the facts
I flow from the brain to the paper to the wax
Back niggas down like automatic gunfire
I perspire when I show a MC how to holla for the have my power locked down
like Rottweiler dogs
Don't be appalled at the crowd just because they applaud
When they lock-jawed but don't follow yours
Yours was only endured for a minute or more
Until I took the floor
And came through with the definitive raw
The textbook definition of ""damn he nice!""
I'm so explosive like bullets bust from ya biscuit
Sometimes my shit is too explicit to risk it
But these idiots love the pain
And they ain't really tryin' to risk it
Nigga listen!

So check the rhyme to the rhythm
Or shiver when I give a
Very fat deliver-why
The process only Jemini, me
Other MC's is corny I set ya souls free
The baddest born motherfucker ever to pick up a mic
And when I touch the structure
Watch the structure rupture
Clutch ya, might butt ya
Not the type to get down with the baddest
The Jemini status
I'm blunt with the gun so I stomp out ya business
Plus I can dominate ya physical fitness
So witness the Jemini shit comin' from way back
Beef with me chief I throw the blade to ya nutsack for payback
Don't ya try to diss me like a gamer
I got rhymes in the clip plus one inside the chamber

Danger Mouse,"We touched the walls of the city streets and
Dead ends plain, sadly showed us our ways
Of never asking why

Cast down it was heaven sent and
To the church, no intent to repent on my knees
Just to cry

Until you travel to that place you can't come back
Where the last painting's gone and all that's left is black

Grey nights he's coming to me and
Some day they'll punish my deeds and they'll find
All the crimes

But then they ask when they gonna see them
Then they gonna ask to feel the ghosts, the walls, the dreams
We'll I've got mine

At last those coming came and they never looked back
With blinding stars in their eyes but all they saw was black

Fooled them hoping to seem
Like a slave of evil but the product of greed and
It's not a mass so be honest with me
We can't afford to ignore that I'm the disease

Practical since we had to be and
When they were old they came back to me and they tried
Oh they tried

And when you follow through and wind up on your back
Looking up at those stars in the sky those white clouds have turned it black",Black

This crazy state of shock
Have you seen the problem queen
She's never far away
Away from me

And it seems all a dream
Some sad luxury
Of when I escaped

Can't see through this hazy view
And all the doors are locked
We're only alive when we can be
Defectors from the clock
The clock of all time

She comes and she goes
But where no one knows
And when Her Highness grows
She shakes me

Danger Radio,"Late night contemplating on the words to say.
Gotta set the record straight.
Pretend that I'm alright.
I give in to the night.

She's got me on the edge, I'm slipping.
Try to look away.
But she stares deep down inside me.
And I lose my way, can't fight.
I give in to the night.

[Chorus]
So if it's love that she wants.
Love that she's after.
Don't come looking for me.
Cause I'm so far gone.
So if it's love that she wants.
Love that she's after.
Don't come looking for me.
Cause I'm so far gone.

Been exhausted.
I'm so warn out by the games she plays.
Sneaking off.
You leave me hanging.
I won't take that bait.
Can't offer you forgiveness.
Or justify your foolish mistakes.

[Chorus]

(So far gone)
(So far gone)
(So far gone)

So drained and falling apart.
Predicted it from the start.
Tried hard to break it.
But I strayed too far away.
Your words, they don't mean a thing.
I stayed despite of the pain.
I'll keep it my distance.
And you'll keep all the blame.

Late call said you were alone
Crying to me about all the things that we said

Said you hadn't slept in days
Said that you need me

So i come back opened my mind
Decided to give you the time
To make it up to me and not turn away

Fooled me once more with your disguise

Can't stand to be beside me
Used and Abused me
But I won't be coming back no more

Left all my thoughts of you behind

Tell me how I got so lost
Bring me back to days uncharted

I've seen a big change, in how I think lately
No signs of sympathy, whoa whoa
Came out and came clean, force fed the enemy
For her tranquility, whoa whoa

Brought me down with her vanity, facile things are destroying me
Completely driven by a deadly obsession
The words slide into her ear, she doesn't listen cause it wasn't clear
Pushed down to the ground, it's an emergency

She played a huge role in how I've been lately
Stole all my sanity, whoa whoa
Hold tight and kissed me and now I'm completely
Under this certainty, whoa whoa

Too many questions that have been left unanswered
Holds me down so I never leave, she holds cards that I've never seen
Pushed down to the ground, it's an emergency

We were dreamin'

We were best of friends

Always hang together, forever
Thought we'd always be that way

His mother, god bless her
Asked me if I'd say a word or two
Lookin' out in a room full of strangers

All I could tell was of two old friends
And some long gone summer days of

Mas lejos de lo normal de lo que hace
La gente se hace fácil te quiero
Y yo quiero inventar esa frase
Acorde a todo esto que siento.

Y te quiero más, que este tiempo atrás,
Quiero cubrir tu cuerpo entero
Y dejar a las cosas pasar
Y que digan su nombre
Y mirar que lo que hay es verdad
Y que nada se esconde
Y pensar y dejarse llevar
Y no ponerle nombre
No hace falta,
Si sientes ya está
Y déjame que te ronde.

Dani Martín,"Desde pequeño quise ser una estrella del rock 
Pero la vida me dejó solo cantante de pop 
Romper televisores y beber mucho ron 
Y una familia des-estructurada por intoxicación 
Todo eso es necesario para ser dios del rock 
Y tener una gran critica en la Rolling Stone 

Y que le voy hacer, si yo no quiero ir de autentico 
Lo mio viene de serie y yo no necesito unas gafas de sol 
Y que le voy a hacer, si a los cuatro entendidos 
No les gusta que yo venda discos solo por ser como soy 

Desde pequeño quise ser una estrella del soul 
Pero la vida me dejó ser un triste canta autor 
Romper cien mil hoteles y pensar que soy dios

Lo mio viene de serie y yo no necesito unas gafas de sol 
Y que le voy a hacer, si a los cuatro entendidos 
No les gusta que yo venda discos solo por ser como soy

Eres un fresa con cara de lindo pobre chavito español 
Y que le vamos a hacer si el rock and roll no es tu puesto 
Los guantes desde el cariño te invitan a verlo dedícate al pop

Dani Martín,"Pienso en despertarte cada mañana
Con un beso chulo y una guerra de almohadas
Pienso enamorarte en cada mirada
Con la sonrisita que yo sé que te encanta

Que no me puedas mirar
Del amor que sientes ya
Que no quieras dormir sin mí
Que no te quieras despertar

Te espero mi teatro es para ti
Ven a fabricar la luz
Que alumbre esta función
Donde tu actriz enamoro
Al actor que vive en mi
Interpretando a un hombre serio
Aburrido y ya cansado de un papel que le impusieron

Pienso en conquistarte cada mañana
Que te sientas guapa porque te dé la gana
Pienso en admirarte sin que tu hagas nada
Porque tu silencio es la obra más cara

Que no me puedas mirar
Del amor que sientes ya
Que no quieras dormir sin mí
Que no te quieras despertar

Te espero mi teatro es para ti
Ven a fabricar la luz

Cádiz al fin
Me cruzo unos ojos que rozó
Me miras, te miro, va a ser que sí
Te pareces al del canto del loco
Toda la tarde, Sevilla y Madrid
Nos vamos a un bar que conozco
Vienen amigos ‘Si os queréis venir'
Y miro tu boca y me rompo
Y después, me viniste a ver

Y dormimos, temblamos y huiste al amanecer
Y después, quisiste volver
Porque allí se quedaron tus gafas
Y un poco de tu piel
No era el baile perfecto
Ni el momento soñado
Mil movimientos perdidos
Ni el motivo buscado
Solo dos bailarines
Escapando y luchando
Una guerra de pasos
Sin conflictos al lado

Diez de diciembre
Y llega a su fin
Aquí acaba el vals de los locos
Lloran Sevilla, Cádiz, Madrid
No habrá otro verano en otoño

Y después, no te he vuelto a ver

Y después, qué vendrá después
Si ya no hay gafas ni besos de playa que hagan volver

Pior foi descobrir que eu não te acho
Que não existe igual ao teu abraço
Pior é não saber o que é que eu faço agora
Pior que se perder um grande amor
É essa sensação de estar perdido
É esse coração arrependido
Se culpando por você ter ido embora

Eu até hoje estou ralando por aí
Nada calmo existe um tumulto aqui
Alguma coisa de você não foi embora
Eu acho que eu gosto disso
De vez em quando você rola dos meus olhos
E em perigo chego a chamar por ti
Porque esqueço que não te mandei embora
Foi você quem quis partir

Eu não tô pedindo pra você voltar
Só tô te contando como é que tá

Que eu vivo sem você, sem você

Pra poder me namorar

Quando ela me quer
Nem faz ideia do que ela é capaz
Numa porta e quatro paredes

Quando ela solta os cabelos
Me arrepia inteiro, me tira do ar

Daniel,"Eu nasci num recanto feliz
Bem distante da povoação
Foi ali que eu vivi muitos anos
Com papai mamãe e os irmãos
Nossa casa era uma casa grande
Na encosta de um espigão
Um cercado pra guardar bezerro
E ao lado um grande mangueirão

No quintal tinha um forno de lenha
E um pomar onde as aves cantava
Um coberto pra guardar o pilão
E as traias que papai usava
De manhã eu ia no paiol
Um espiga de milho eu pegava
Debuiava e jogava no chão
Num instante as galinhas juntava

Nosso carro de boi conservado
Quatro juntas de bois de primeira
Quatro cangas, dezesseis cansis
Encostados no pé da figueira
Todo sabado eu ia na vila
Fazer compras para semana inteira
O papai ia gritando com os bois
Eu na frente ia abrindo as porteiras

Nosso sítio que era pequeno
Pelas grandes fazendas cercado
Precisamos vender a propriedade
Para um grande criador de gado
E partimos pra a cidade grande
A saudade partiu ao meu lado
A lavoura virou colonião
E acabou-se meu reino encantado

Hoje ali só existe tres coisas
Que o tempo ainda não deu fim
A tapera velha desabada
E a figueira acenando pra mim
E por ultimo marcou saudade
De um tempo bom que já se foi
Esquecido em baixo da figueira
Nosso velho carro de boi",Meu Pai

Bem mais perto de mim

Bem mais verde do que o verde capim

Sobrevoando os campos
Pra beijar a doce flor da maçã

Feito cobra no chão
Escondo meu veneno e me entrego
Com amor e paixão

Sem ela eu me perco 
Fico feito sabiá sem laranjeira 
Sem ela sou bom dia de ressaca
Em dia de segunda-feira

Sem ela sou alguém pela metade
Sou um grito de saudade
Sufocado e sem razão, sem ela
Destruída na maldade
Pela força de um vulcão

Vou viajando pela estrada
O vento sopra meus cabelos
No retrovisor eu vejo os olhos da minha amada

Os faróis vão clareando
Todas curvas do caminho
No tapete de asfalto
Cai a noite nos meus olhos
E pra espantar o sono 
Ligo meu rádio bem alto

Quando a solidão alisa
O meu coração avisa
Penso logo lá em casa 
Pego firme no volante
Piso fundo no possante
O danado cria asas

O meu cavalo de aço
Não reclama do cansaço
Nem derrapa na banguela
Pra lembrar de quem me ama
Deito no meu banco - cama
Vendo o céu pela janela

Quando um companheiro avisa
Que na frente tem polícia

Quando passo na porteira até vejo a sua imagem
O seu rangido tão triste mais parece uma mensagem
Daquele rosto trigueiro desejando-me boa viagem

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Jag har famlat i mörker, men i dig såg jag ljuset
Och för dig har jag låtsats, och dolt mina tårar
Med dig blir jag mindre, som gubben i lådan

Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar
För dig ska jag göra det tusen gånger om

Blivit lämnad i staden, medan du gick och blunda
Fick jag kängor mot magen, tills jag smakade gatan
Ändå gick jag tillbaka, och jag måste va galen
Som nyss blivit bedragen, och som tänkte på laget
För jag trängde bort jag-et, och jag såg alla tecken
Men jag ville va bättre, men då blev allting sämre

Ta mitt skimmer, för jag brinner, du är blott en blek lanterna

Holding you again would only do me good

sos mi amor del fin del mundo 
que me vuelve moribundo con tu piel tierra del fuego. Ushuaia 
quiero irme y me da miedo 
quizás es porque te quiero y no quiero abandonarte

Et de ma fenêtre
Quand je les ai vus t'emmener
Ma tête s'est voûtée

Les pleures que j'avais sur les mains
S'essoufflaient courant vers les tiens
Qui se refermaient derrière toi
En étouffant tout ce qui restait de ma voix

Des sentiments bâtards
A caresser le ciel
Ou encore à flirter les trottoirs
Me poussent vers Viertel
Pour essayer de te revoir
Pour ne pas bluffer mon espoir
Je me cogne la tête au mur
Et j'irrite mes larmes sures
Sur son armure

Et puis je serre les dents
Crois-moi, ne l'oublie pas, compte sur moi
Embrasse nos parents
Dis-leur que je suis leur enfant

Et de ma fenêtre
Je t'écris ma lettre
J'ai trop de mal à m'endormir
Et si mon sang dévire
C'est le fumée que je respire
Et qui me pousse à revenir
Du côté de Viertel
En espérant que tu passeras par le ciel

Et quand je me sens fort
Je parle aux miradors
Et si je sais qu'ils te surveillent
C'est qu'ils tuent mon sommeil
En m'empêchant de t'embrasser
En éclairant ce pauvre baiser
Que je t'envoie par courrier

Que mes yeux puent l'alcool, que j'fais bien d'arrêter
Brûleront mon auréole
Saliront mon passé

Alors je serai vieux et je pourrai crever
Je me cherch'rai un Dieu pour tout me pardonner
J'veux mourir malheureux
Pour ne rien regretter, j'veux mourir malheureux",Le Chanteur

Evelyne et moi, des choses à construire

On ne savait pas que j'allais mourir

Evelyne et moi, les mêmes plaisirs

Que ça ne devait
Jamais finir

J'ai noyé mes mains
Mais tu n'y peux rien
Evelyne et lui je le sais se parlaient en anglais
Evelyne et lui, mais je comprenais
Dans la chambre du bas
Moi je serrais son ombre
Entre mes bras
Entre mes bras
Evelyne et moi, je le sais pourtant elle me voulait du bien
S'occupait de moi, et ses joues de satin
Caressait mes mains
Moi je me perdais
Dans son amour calin

Et moi sous la pluie, je ne me souviens de rien

Daniel Balavoine,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

When your love is falling like the rain
I close my eyes and it falls again
When will I get the chance to say I love you
I pretend that you?re already mine
Then my heart ain?t breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this

If only I could get through this

",Gotta Get Thru This [Acoustic Version]
Daniel Bedingfield,"Tell me I should not be feeling what
I am today
Tell me to silence my heart
Tell me we've been here before
And I will walk away from your love

For there is a wall between you and I
And he hasn't been treating you right
I've been watching it all
I've seen you cry
And I just gotta tell you tonight

That he don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't want to have your children
He don't want to build his life around you

Tell me this love's just a feeling and
will pass away
Tell me your heart is a liar
Tell me you're not what I know you are
All that a man could desire
And he doesn't know
Darling, what he's got
But I would treasure you
If you give me a chance
I will make you smile
I will give you a love that's true
But he don't love you like I love you...

So why can you not see
This place in your heart that was
made for me
Why must you hide yourself away
And why must you fight
The way that I'm holding your hand tonight
Take a chance and give your heart to me



",He Don't Love You Like I Love You
Daniel Bedingfield,"Can you see
Honest questions in my heart this hour
Opening like a flower
To the rain?
And do you know the silent sorrow
Of a never ending journey
Through the pain

Do you see a brighter day for me?
Another day?
A day?
Do you wonder what's in store for me?
The cure for me?
The way?

Oh look down see the tears I've cried
Lives I've lived
The deaths I've died
You died them too
And all for me

And you say (faded)

""I will pour my water down
Upon a thirsty barren land
And streams will flow from the dust of
Your bruised and broken soul
You will grow like the grass 
Upon the fertile plains of Asia
You will grow, You will grow""

Do you know
The story from the start?
And do you know me
Like you've always told me?
Do you see
The whispers in my heart against your kindness
My eternal blindness
Do you see?

Do you see a brighter day for me?
Another day?
A day?
Do you wonder what's in store for me?
The cure for me?
The way?

I can't explain the way I'm feeling tonight
I'm losing control of my heart
Tell me what can I do to make you happy
Nothing I ever say seems to come out right
I'm losing control of my heart

And I wish that I could be
Another better part of me
Can't hear what your thinking
Maybe if I just let go
you'd open up your heart

But I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart defending I get left behind
I can't reach you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart protecting I get left behind

I like you so much I'm acting stupid
I can't play the game I'm all intense and alive
I'm losing control of my heart
I'm not supposed to be this nervous
I should play my hand all cool and calm
I can't breathe
I'm losing control of my heart

And I wish that you could see
The other better parts of me
Feel this fire I'm feeling
Then you'd see me in control
And baby then you'd know

But I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart defending I get left behind

Daniel Bedingfield,"If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?

I never know what the future brings,
But I know you are here with me now,
We'll make it through,
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand,
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away,
But I know that this much is true,
We'll make it through,
And I hope you are the one I share my life with,
And I wish that you could be the one I die with,
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with,
I hope I love you all my life

I don't want to run away but I can't take it , I don't understand,
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss you body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away,
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today,
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right,
And though I can't be with you tonight,
You know my heart is by your side

I don't want to run away but I can't take it,

Daniel Bedingfield,"Rang her up and her father said, ""She's gone.
You're too late, boy, she's already been taken.""
Rang again, what her father said was wrong.
""It's not true, boy, daddy was mistaken.""

What am I to do about it
What am I to do about this thing
There's no way I can feel about it
'Cause I don't even know how much I love her

Why did I listen to those lies when you were standing there for me?

Donde el barro se subleva
Ya sé, no me digas tenes razón
La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más
Mi confesión

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función

Daniel Block,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

Daniel Cage,"Even long distance you know I come running
I see you coming, but I never find you here
If it was summer I'd jump into your waterfall 
It's too cold as the night begins to fall

The sun could come out 
And I could feel again

If I lose this love, where do I go
My minds made up but you don't know
You're so sorry 
I don't see you cry
You find me here under my big blue sky
Under my bug blue sky

And If I am jaded by what I think my world could be
You and I made it, Then spread it across the seven seas
But your words could turn black and blue
Do I know, Do I know, Do I know you

The sun could come out 
And I could feel again

If I lose this love, where do I go
My minds made up but you don't know
You're so sorry 
I don't see you cry
You find me here under my big blue sky
Under my bug blue sky

Don't you understand, it's somewhere to land

If I lose this love, where do I go
My minds made up but you don't know
You're so sorry 
I don't see you cry
You find me here under my big blue sky
Under my bug blue sky",Big Blue Sky
Daniel Cage,"All i know is when I grow I won't feel like I do
Love could turn and I feel it burn
So i Chase after you You covered me in sun
But now I'm free, Now I'm free

All I see is beautiful and I see it slip away
All I see is beautiful But I , I see it burn

The sugars sweet and I am complete
At least i feel today
before to long, I'll hear the song
And turn to walk away

And the darkness will turn into light
Now I see the world for the first time
If I don't break all the lies that I make
I'll only leave them for you
If I could hear your voice on the phone
It's better then being alone

I'll light the sun
And the darkness will turn into light
Now I see the world for the first time
For the first time

A butterfly flies and a birds don't swim
You told me again and again
But if I don't do all the things that you do
It doesn't mean there's no where to begin

I'll light the sun
And the darkness will turn into light
Now I see the world for the first time
For the first time

I'll take all the gold I thought was mint
And I'd trade it for a minute of time
So I keep waiting

I'll light the sun
And the darkness will turn into light
Now I see the world for the first time
For the first time
For the first time",The First Time
Daniel Cage,"Hannah looked up then she looked down
Then she through her love around to me
When you came a year ago
You didn't feel the weight of all the world
Do you feel it
Because the night will come
And you won't go out
But time it can turn so hear me out

All The angels fall from the sky
If you'd believe so would I
Take my hand and don't you cry
Sing me something sweet make us all believe tonight

Hannah, Hannah won't you come 
It is like you've been here all along
Open up the book you knew
To see the faces staring back at you
Don't you see them
Because the moon overhead lights your ground, and everybody talks
But we hear no sound

All The angels fall from the sky
If you'd believe so would I
Take my hand and don't you cry
Sing me something sweet make us all believe tonight

And if its only yesterdays noose,
Then I think that we could go out in the night

All The angels fall from the sky
If you'd believe so would I
Take my hand and don't you cry
Sing me something sweet make us all believe tonight

Hannah, Hannah don't you go I just want to know",Hannah
Daniel Cage,"Come tomorrow I'll start again
Come tonight I will pretend
On your world I wanted more
You help me to touch down 
I build you up now I can't get you down 

In your light I feel no pain 
You saved my life again
From your station high I hear your sound 
So never come down never come down

If I'm here tomorrow then I'll believe, Like a miracle
The perfect air you make me breathe, Like a Chemical
I build you up now I can't get you down

In your light I feel no pain 
You saved my life again
From your station high I hear your sound 
So never come down never come down

You shine on me I shine on you
I forget everything I thought I knew
You're down on me I'm down on you
And I won't believe

In your light I feel no pain 
You saved my life again
From your station high I hear your sound 
So never come down never come down

I need you light before I'm gone
Cold is the night without any sun, I need you light",Never Come Down
Daniel Cage,"Holding out your hand I could feel 
Where I go tonight I know is not real
Life without you could only be dry 
Love makes me nervous but I think I could try 
I want to see your love that could live
Next to me, We've got so much to give

I don't want the neon lights and discos
And finding someone new
I don't want another day feeling the way I do
There's only you, there's only you

It's getting late and the night is to cold
Without you its getting and this crowds getting old 
I want to leave, in your love I could dive
Before I was dead now you keep me alive

I don't want the neon lights and discos
And finding someone new
I don't want another day feeling the way I do
There's only you, there's only you",Only You
Daniel Cage,"Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like I'm right
The days are to long and I have to sleep tonight
Where all the words that batter me are turning into lies
And all the hands that hold me fade into the sky 

[Chorus]
I want to dream, I want to see
I'm sleepwalking away with you tonight 
I'm sleepwalking because it's better than real life
I don't want to stop it and I don't know what it means
But its me and its you can't you see

The crowds have all gone and the night is sinking low
There's a place in your heart you still won't let me go
If all the world is spinning and you're almost gone
Could you stop it for a minute, just to let me on

[Chorus]

And if its the world I see tonight, Crowded only by daylight
Tomorrow's the day'll make it right

I'm sleepwalking away with you tonight 
I'm sleepwalking because it's better than real life
I don't want to stop it and I don't know what it means
But its me and its you can't you see
I'm sleepwalking sleepwalking",Sleepwalking
Daniel Cage,"If I wanted to, could there still be me and you?
I'd wait for the storm to pass, then we could make it last
If I was you and you were me, then I could make you see,
All the love and the time we gave away
Because I still see you turn to walk away

There's no light and there no sound
And there's no relied without your love around
I try to say you'll be back someday
But there's only me and you, you set me free, you set me free, you set me free

If I could only know, then I'd tell you where to go
Where you wouldn't have to run, and we could be as one
If you were me and I was you, You'd know what I'm going through
Every hour, every second, today
Because I still see you turn to walk away

There's no light and there no sound
And there's no relied without your love around
I try to say you'll be back someday
But there's only me and you, you set me free, you set me free, you set me free

Maybe I would be better, If I threw out the letters
That I keep inside, that I keep inside
Maybe I would be better, If I threw out the letters
And I should go outside, I should go outside

There's no light and there no sound
And there's no relied without your love around
I try to say you'll be back someday
But there's only me and you, you set me free
You set me free
You set me free
You set me free",You Set ME Free

Why should we spend money

Back in 1992, bababadabababadabababada

It was two years after New kids hit the charts
Six years after Madonna stole my heart
It was TLC on the radio and
""Stop-Hammer time""

Chilli peppers sure could rock
And Kidies made the covers with the help of a sock
I turned down sports for Faith No More
While Slash fed his snakes with blonds from the tour
Bababadabababadabababada

Jeremy spoke in the class today
When the smell of our youth got portrayed
By the man with the voice and pain inside
Ah, fuck that shit, rest his soul, never mind
In my shoes there were room to grow
So I got real high after a pumpkins show
Sure as hell I miss my past
And when I think of it now I smile relaxed

[Chorus]
We listened to ""Would?"" and made out in the car
I took the shit when you dad found out
You were my first and you gave me your heart
Alle I gave you mine...It was 1992

Bababadabababadabababada

And I learned all the songs on cheap guitar
And sat in my room and I looked at the stars
Wondering if wedder had lost it for real
And if Miss Sharon Stone wore panties in the scene

It all made sense with Body Count
The first one to speak were the words came out
And I sang along to ""It's a shame about Ray""
When I found you-I got laid, I got laid

I don’t think I know
Though everyone’s set
Got it on deadlines
Like an astrological sign
Where will you go?
My friend the ghost
You seem down
But I’m here to tell you
That it’s not so bad
Cause, no one really knows how it ends
So, we’ll just see how it plays for us friends
Cause, it’s just all a matter of setting off to the sun
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
Watch as the sun tries to burn
Our eyes
And we’ll laugh cause we’ll all be blind
We’ll be blind
Claiming for clearer sight
And going on
Oh, sorry to stop
I’m quite problematic with talking to people
Though school has helped me
Quite a bit and my friend
You’re the hint
But we have to move on
It’s such a pain, that I cannot bear
So I leave it to you
To the tears, Oh curse you,
Destiny
Cause when I look into the cracks
At everything broken in past
Well, it’s just all a matter off
Playing off to the sun
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
Watch as the sun tries to burn
Our eyes
And we’ll laugh cause we’ll all be blind
We’ll be blind, we’ll be blind……….
Oh so we set sail
But do I have the boats
To till these gardens
Oh I’m sure we’ll be glorious
As we set off to the sun
I don’t want things to end
On such cliché rhymes my friend
I don’t want to go
I am a creep
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
Watch as the sun tries to burn
Our eyes
And we’ll laugh cause we’ll all be blind,
We’ll be blind, we’ll be blind……….
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
Watch as the sun tries to burn
Our eyes
And we’ll laugh cause we’ll all be blind,
We’ll be blind, we’ll be blind…………
And going on…………

We’ll be blind, we’ll be blind…………
And going on…………",Dear Ghosts

The guitar’s syncopated rhythm is so so tight
I’m dancing to this funky beat
So girls, guys, and those in between
Can all get down with me and
We’ll show them what we mean
Gonna shake it, shake it
Break it
Cause We’re On Fire,
Shaking things up
Cause it’s time to get down
Time to do your thing

Don’t let them shut you up
Time to throw things back loud
Time for things to change
You can call me whatever you like
Doesn’t change who I am on the inside
Made of cheese, organs, and carbon
But there’s no set list
I could be summed by
Some man in a white suit
Telling me what to do
Cause I may be an invention
But at least I was the inventor
Making my own trends
But I’m not a setter

to dance like human beings
Move to the left
Move to the right

Now walk that tightrope

Whether you’re high or low
You don’t even have to listen to me
I lack that reliability
Being an upper class kid in the pop stream
But I’ll try to use it in the best way
To say that
Gender is an idea, it’s a concept
The bathrooms are merely suggestions
And to say there are only two options
Is to limit the human definition
And her name was Leelah
And you shouldn’t forget her
As we groove tonight, together,
Alright, alright, alright

We got to take a stand
Now that we're in demand
Party all night, cut the fight

Win a battle you never fought
Just by checkin' this record you bought
Over and on and on again
Get with it and do that thing

Three, four, so get your butt on the floor
Five, six, know you dig the mix
Seven, eight, let it shake
Get down, get up",Get Up
Daniel Díaz Trio,"I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I 
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her, ooh",And I Love Her
