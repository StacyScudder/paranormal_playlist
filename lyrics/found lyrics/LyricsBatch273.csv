Lita Ford,"I see the picture 
You're so broken hearted 
But can I steal a little love from you tonight 
I'd tell you whispers, a little story 
That there's a place in my heart for you tonight 
But why must we be lonely? 
On this night full of rain 
Hold me in your dreams 
And leave me breathless once again 
But I will never understand 
Why must the rain fall down? 
On the boulevard of broken dreams 
Must the tears fall, misty sky 
It's a boulevard of broken dreams 
Yeah 
I close my eyes, and it feels like yesterday 
When we fought for tomorrow 
And lived for the day 
So sweet and innocent 
Like a child with his toy 
Who wishes for nothing 
Left alone with his dreams 
But why must we be sad? 
On this night full of rain 
Take me back to the king 
And leave me breathless once again 
But I will never understand 
Why must the rain fall down? 
On the boulevard of broken dreams 
Must the tears fall, misty sky 
It's a boulevard of broken dreams 
Oh, yeah 
Why must the rain fall down? 
On the boulevard of broken dreams 
Must the tears fall, misty sky 
It's a boulevard of broken dreams 
Why must the rain fall down? 
On the boulevard of broken dreams 
Another lonely face lost in the crowd 
It's a boulevard of broken dreams... 
",Broken Dreams
Lita Ford,"We've changed, a new change of season 
Autumn came, we went, I went insane 
Never was winter so cold, no 
Look away from the homeward road 
I'm feeling love in a daydream 
Making love first morning light 
Walking slowly in the summer rain 
Alone I lie, fantasize 
I'm falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
Slip inside my dream 
Dream away with me 
'Cause I'm falling in and out of love 
Like a diamond, never our love would break 
But in a heartbeat thrown us both away 
Set me free to live my life like a rolling stone 
Look away from the homeward road 
I'm feeling love in a daydream 
Making love first morning light 
Walking slowly in the summer rain 
Alone I lie, fantasize 
Falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
Slip inside my dream 
Dream away with me 
'Cause I'm falling in love 
Falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
Falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love... 
",Falling in and Out of Love
Lita Ford,"When I was 18, you know I fell in love with you 
But you were the bitch babe 
I guess you'd call it a fatal passion 
You try to pull my trigger, always leading my on 
Makin' up your own rules, I was always the clown 
Times must change now, you'll see it my way 
I just can't take it 
What you don't know, I must say 
I guess we both had a lot to learn, 
Uh, huh 
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned 
Don't call me insane, 'cause that's not my game 
Turn your head, you're dead 
From a fatal passion 
Cross your heart and hope you survive 
Fatal passion 
You're like a broken picture 
A mirrored image I can't see 
You tried to lock me up 
And you swallowed the key 
My mind's been twisted 
Time my wounds must heal 
Lookin' back in anger 
Now you know just how I feel 
But tell me where do you draw the line, 
Uh, huh 
It's time that you realize 
Don't call me insane, 
'Cause that's not my game 
Turn your head, you're dead 
You try to pull my trigger, always leading my on 
Makin' up your own rules, I was always the clown 
I guess we both had a lot to learn, 
Uh, huh 
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned 
Don't call me insane, 'cause that's not my game

From a fatal passion 
Cross your heart and hope you survive

Lita Ford,"Are you a hero, or are you the lonely one? 
Do you ever get scared, don't you ever feel pain? 
Under the loaded gun 
You are a Romeo, with nowhere to run 
You are the winner that loses in the end 
Under the gun 
So you stand up and fight 
For what you believe 
There is no wrong or right 
There is no black or white 
Now the time has come 
It's your turn to die, 
Under the gun 
Under the gun 
How many heartaches can man one take? 
How many lonely dreams are shattered, 
By one man's mistake? 
So shed a tear for the tough guy 
Now the damage is done 
No one to justify the truth, my friend, hey! 
When you're under the gun 
So you stand up and fight 
For what you believe 
There is no wrong or right 
There is no black or white 
Now the time has come 
It's your turn to die, 
Under the gun 
Under the gun 
Yeah!

Lita Ford,"We only take what we need

Lita Ford,"7 o'clock and I'm hangin' here
Thinking where I'd rather be
The same ol' dive and the same ol' jerks
Are tryin' to take a piece of me
I think I need a hit, 'cause I'm sick of this shit
I guess there's only one thing I need
Hey there, sugar baby
Won't you come and rescue me

Be my bad boy
Be my love thing
Be my holy roller
When I can't get enough
I need my bad boy to shake me up

Gotta get out, I gotta get out
I get a little tired of the same ol' jive
I need a real hellcat to show me where it's at
And push me into overdrive
I gotta knack for destruction

Lita Ford,"I heard about ya from a girl backstage 
You were packin' it with nothin' but you carried a 12 gauge 
Everybody told me stay away from this dude 
He's got a nasty reputation, too many tattoos 
I said, ""Hey, say what?"" 
I hear you carry a big gun, wild one, yeah 
You wanna show me something 
Big Gun, you're not the only one 
I'm never shotgun shy 
I'm just a troubleshooter lookin' for something sweet 
I looked hard and I saw you coming 
Bang, bang, you're in love 
Some like it hot, some like it smooth 
Every cock on the walk has got something to prove 
Hey little rooster you can take what I'm giving 
Got my tongue in my cheek makin' noise for a livin'

Your heart is pounding at my throat 
I can't catch my breath 
I lost it when your fingertips 
Ran down my back and up my neck

I'm so hungry for your sex 
I got an appetite for love tonight 
I wanna taste your sweet thing 
I wanna feel the sting of your sex, of your sex

We ripped the sheets right off the bed 
My fingernails left fiery trails 
Across your back, oh, tell me baby

Is it love that's on my mind or is it fantasy?

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Sometimes it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger, and stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in your warm and darkend grave?

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?  No I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?  No I'll never feel the same

I know I've been so hard on you; I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish, I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?",Close My Eyes Forever

Io vorrei sapere
Chi governa il mondo
E cosa gli direbbe
Uno che e' senza lavoro
Vorrei sapere
Come si fa a cadere
E come puoi risalire
Senza farti male
Sono un ragazzo
Ricordatevi che esisto
Sono il re del Nulla
Mentre il Nulla ruba I migliori

Vorrei sapere
Perche' non e' reato
Fare la puttana di stato
Ed abusare ogni potere
E sono senza un letto
Ma mi basterebbe un tetto
Almeno fino a domani
Prima che la marea cresca
Sono un ragazzo
Ricordatevi che esisto
Sono il re del Nulla
Mentre il Nulla ruba I migliori

Lavorare per contare
Non si puo' dire che sia godere
Meglio impazzire
Che stare qui a vegetare
E sono senza un letto
Ma mi basterebbe un tetto
Almeno fino a domani
Prima che la marea cresca

Noi siamo tipi che fanno dannare
Siamo noi, proprio noi che non dormiamo mai
O forse siamo tipi che ti danno da fare
Se resisti resisto insisto anche nei guai
Cosi' io lo dico
Rifarei tutto
E qua posso dirlo
Ne farei di piu'
E voglio andare nel modo piu' perso
Per sognare il mondo all' inverso
L' onorevole dice che ora vuol progredire
Nelle case le strade le piazze e ora qua
E noi siamo ancora qui a farlo dannare
La nostra resistenza sono I guai
Cosi' io lo dico
Rifarei tutto
E qua posso dirlo
Ne farei di piu'
E sognare il mondo all' inverso
Voglio andare nel modo piu' perso
Per inventare un altro universo
E giocare col mondo all' inverso, 'azzo!
Oh no!
L' onorevole mi fa che ora si da' da fare
La morale e' che la torta e' ancora tutta sua
Ma noi siamo ancora qui con la fionda di parole
Gliele miro le tiro sempre anche nei guai
E sognare sognare il mondo all' inverso, sono perso
E fammi andare in un altro universo
E resisti resisti resisti resisti dai
Io resisto dai resisti
Io resisto dai resisti
E sognare il mondo all' inverso, 'azzo!
Voglio andare nel modo piu' perso
Per inventare un altro universo, ayo!
E giocare col mondo all' inverso
Ah!

In direzione sud

Vedemmo Pancho Villa

Se guardo il cielo non lo sfioro neppure
E il paradiso sembra un sogno da pazzi
Forse vorrei inventarne uno nuovo

Sono un bastardo se distruggo tutto

Voglio fare un fuoco di tutto
Perche' la noia passi via

Come un lupo nella notte
Sono il selvaggio nelle strade deserte
E sto cercando un paese innocente

Il sogno vola
Aquila o farfalla
Che piomba giu' dal cielo come bomba che balla
E gira il mondo
Cambiando pelle
Confonde il suo nemico e resta sogno ribelle
Lo puoi ignorare o cancellare
Servira' soltanto questo a farlo lottare
Io giro il mondo
Seguo le stelle
Graffio la ragione e nasce il sogno ribelle
E gira gli occhi
Guardando il Sole
Per ogni cosa troverai le parole
Super-protetto ed inviolato
La tua vita non ha significato
Cambia artiglieria
Usa l' energia
Pretendi I tuoi diritti
Per primo quelli scritti
Cerca di lottare come se fosse amare
Quello e' il dinosauro
Non devi farlo alzare
No
In fondo agli occhi ho mille soli
Mille volte voglia di cambiare colore
Cambiare uomo cambiare pelle
Giorno e notte cresce il nostro sogno ribelle
Se giri gli occhi guardando il sole
Per ogni cosa troverai le parole

Avvelenando il nostro viaggio

Gentildonna lei, che sotto sotto si identifica
E fai viaggiare con il biglietto speciale,

In processione sotto la campana,
Mentre pregano che Dio protegga l'uscio e la bottega

Indubbiamente mi si stende sotto una cappella
Bianca stella dell' universo dell' inutile

Gioie e noie di anni di convivenza
Per qualcuno sono una schiavitu'
La coppia in crisi genera cattivi odori
E poi mostri fughe ed altri guai
Bella e dolce in cerca di un' esperienza
Vuole un lui sensibile ai suoi guai
Vive insoddisfatta dell' esistenza
Cerca storia ad alta intensita'
Bella e dolce ha sete di conoscenza
Vuole mascherarsi un po' con me
La mia fantasia non ha coscienza
La tentazione striscia verso lei lei lei
Sogna Adamo, sogna d' Eva
E il suo nome e' Giulia
Da lontano cosi' vera
Sembra gia' sbocciare
Ah Ah!
Perche' la dolce tentazione di cambiare sapore
Mi fa pazzia'
E immagino la parte che e' piu' buona in te
La parte piu' vitale che see'e' in te
In te
In te
Belle sponde in cerca di conoscenza
In adorazione di sua maesta'
Organi ghiotti e prensile ebbrezza
La mia caravella approda qui qui qui
Sono Adamo
Tu sei Eva
Sono il tuo serpente
Da vicino mascherata ti potro' sfamare
Ah ah perche'
La sana tentazione di cambiare sapore
Mi fa e ti fa offrire quella parte piu' nascosta in noi
E il tuo mistero e' una richiesta in piu'
Ah Ah tu sei una professionista o casalinga annoiata
Ci sei o ci fai una contorsionista sull' anguilla infuocata
Ma il tuo profumo io lo conosco gia'
Ne tuo mistero see' e' una sporca verita'

Tu sei Eva
Sono il tuo serpente

Torri come pere, il silenzio e' gia' passato
Nei corridoi resta il fumo della prima guardia
Uomo col fucile, il nemico e' la tua noia
Sei prigioniero e resti solo a difenderti dal freddo
Nuoto nel nero, dove sfioro le tue mani
Poi apro gli occhi steso in aria, e' la prima guardia
Esplode il mondo e resto solo, dalle mani nasce un fiume
L' alba e' un miraggio, che mi esplode dentro
Mi scuserai se parlo una lingua diversa
Un anno e' un secolo, 365 croci
E la tua privazione mi taglia la testa
Uomo col fucile, prigioniero della tua bandiera
E corri in tondo, testa in fumo, e' la prima guardia
Torri come pere, ma il nemico non esiste
Esplode il nulla e resto solo a difendermi dal buio
Grido l' allarme che mi esplode dentro
Perche' noi siamo al mondo problemi diversi
Un anno e' un secolo, 365 croci
E la tua privazione mi taglia la testa; avevo una testa
Un anno e' un secolo, 365 croci,
E la tua privazione mi taglia la testa
Grido l' allarme che m' esplode dentro
Perche' lo so che siamo problemi diversi; lingue diverse.

E il materasso e' un' onda del mare

E rokka e rolla in una testa vuota

alone in the gloom, in splendid isolation
sometimes I need to be, left in my own company,
so here I am, in splendid isolation.

I'm hoping I'll stay, in splendid isolation,
If they were right I'd agree, but it's them they know not me

for a moment there I thought I'd lost me wicked ways,
It's not that I'm a leper when my mind allows
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.

to make him come her way (come her way)

Had one just like her on a far off Eastern shore,
and every town, that he'd sailed round was like the one before
and thought he said he loved her, his words were like his heart
they were empty as a summer stream that dries up oh so hard

Oh sail away again, away again

Take a look at me and you will find
Everyday I love you more

Can't you see you must be blind, to not see I'm delerious
Fortunately you are not, a desperate proclaimer
That would be the worst thing on my mind.

My answer wouldn't suit ya,
So, I'd better be a charmer,
'Cause, I didn't mean to harm ya!

So wait one second 'til daylight's low,
Let old time sentiment begin to flow,
I'm oh so sorry I wanna make amends,
Give me one more chance to let you down again.

I've been painting pretty pictures,
Sold a promise that I'd fix ya, But I'm just a fool for
action,
And soon got pulled off by distraction.

So hold that tongue before I pull it out,
So bored of bullets coming out of your mouth,
I got money only me my friend,
Give me one more chance to let you down again.

There's nobody in the bed clothes,
Just impressions where my head goes,
So, I'd better be a chamer,

Tired of living a life like that
Giving a love she don't get back
Lies as big as a Pontiac
Rolling all over her
Tired of the words that just won't stick
She knows not to believe it
No more hanging on to what will never be
No more hanging on to what will never be

Straight down the line
She misreads his every move each and every time
And if love once was blind
She's opened up her eyes to see the fading light
She's been a prisoner of her emptiness
Locked in a box of her own,loneliness

She was more then just a homecoming queen and daddy's little girl

Slept all the way to Nashville,big dreams running through her mind
She said sure as I'm breathing I'm gonna be a big someday

Yeah,yeah,yeah,it's all about trying

It's been six years since she left home and she hasn't made it big yet
Oh but there's no second guessing baby,she's got no regrets

That muddy water running through my veins
And I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train
It sings to me and it sounds familiar

I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

That honeysuckle and it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old camp creek

I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go

It's where I learned about love
It's where I learned about working hard
And having a little was just enough

It's where I learned about Jesus
And knowing where I stand
You can take it or leave it, this is me
This is who I am

Give me a tin roof
A front porch and a gravel road
And that's home to me
It feels like home to me

Held his hand and kissed his face
Then he closed his eyes
And I watched him slip away

Yeah time is turning fast

I wanna love
Like one more day is
Never too much never enough
I wanna drink in
Everything that I can
Life is a vapor
Fire and paper
Gonna make the most of it before its gone

When I lay my head down at the end of another day
Did I keep it all to myself
Or did I give my love away
Did I hold who should have been held
So they remember just how I felt
Did I say what should be said
Will I wake with no regrets

I wanna live
I wanna love
Like one more day is
Never too much never enough
I wanna drink in
Everything that I can
Life is a vapor
Fire and paper
Gonna make the most of it before its gone

There was a man who walked the land centuries ago
He brought water the thirsty heart
And food to the hungry soul
He was here only thirty three years
But his life changed to world
And he gave up all he had
I wanna leave a legacy like that

I wanna live
I wanna love
Like one more day is
Never too much never enough
I wanna drink in
Everything that I can

Where the deer and the possum do play.

Breaking hard ground for a piece of land
Up before the sun and down before the rising moon

Settle for less and hope for more

""Y'all smell the salt of the beach?""

With a kitchenette
Bedspreads of sea-foam green
It was sunburns and taking turns
On boogie boards we'd bring

I filled a coffee can with some Benjamins

We could hardly remember a thing

It was cigarettes, girls we just met

Every little landslide, catch it in my hand I won't say a word

Soon as you slam the door my tears fall to the floor

Little Boots,"Mathematics is a difficult thing
I never understood what was the missing link
And by the time I calculated the correct solution
The question had escaped me and so did the conclusion

So tell me everything must always equal two
Or nothing else is true
And I'll believe you 'cause your X is equal to my why
But equations pass me by

So will you take just a little of my mind and subtract it from my soul
Add a fraction of your half and you'll see it makes me whole
Multiply it by the times that we've never been apart
You'll see nothing can divide just a heart plus a heart

A little of my mind, take it from my soul
A fraction of your half, see it makes me whole
And multiply the times, never be apart
'Cause nothing can divide a heart plus a heart

Don't know my Fibonacci or Pythagoras
But the only formula I know will work for us is that
When we're together in the sum of our parts
It's far greater than what we added up to at the start

My transmission starts when you're alone
I know that it's hard when things get dark

I know the journey's never easy
When circumstances and dreams become a reality
It's never quite the same

I only hope that you get this message
I only hope that a part of me can get through to you
Across the empty space

Remember to tune into my heart wherever you are
My frequency starts when we're apart
I know that it's hard when things get dark

Tune into my heart whenever you're cold
My transmission starts when you're alone
I know that it's hard when things get dark

Remember to tune into my heart
Remember to tune into my heart
Into my heart, into my heart
Into my heart, into my heart

Remember to tune into my heart wherever you are
My frequency starts when we're apart
I know that it's hard when things get dark

Tune into my heart whenever you're cold
My transmission starts when you're alone
I know that it's hard when things get dark

Tune into my heart, tune into my heart
Tune into my heart, tune into my heart
Tune into my heart, tune into my heart

Smoke and mirrors all around
Kick this beat out of the room
Till you hear my heart go boom

Find me in a crowd of silhouettes

I wear my headphones at the disco
And nobody ever has to know
I wear my headphones at the disco
And when the music stops
Then you'll hear me singing

La la lalala, la la la la lalala (x4)

Out of step and out of time
Close my eyes, I'm feeling fine
Colours flashing on my face
I could be in outta space

Changing lanes in my mind
Passing towns we don't know
Heading for the unknown
All our friends left behind
They're not even on my mind

We can drive away

Heavy eyes, on the road

We won't drown, we won't hide

See it all with my naked eye
The world's revolving like it's mine

Speeding down the motorway
Tired of child's play
Growing up another way

She knows she can do it well
'Cause she won't, she won't
She won't follow down to his bed

Begging them back?
Why does it feel so wrong
Just trying to be strong?

I'm still the same Pooh, I still
Do the things I used to, I still hang with the same crew
The way I act now I blame to
The other chick I speak about got addicted to the fame to
I rocked a couple joints the album sell
I got a couple points, small change to the pockets
I don't understand these broads logic, I break 
Bread with the fam before I hit em with a piece a profit
I'm allergic to you hoes stop it
Got me wonderin' was the attention before 
Or after the shock of seein Big Pooh's pic in the store
Got yo eyes money green and me slammin the door

Is it the way I rhyme that got you stressed, sittin' in the
Back sweatin' and lookin' a mess
Nervous even pervis you shots with the bullets you pussycat

But who wouldn't, swingin' aimlessly 
You got the same nerve to say you in the same vain as me
How ashamed are we you not the man that we claimed 
To be now are fame is in jeopardy
You shouldn't have slept on me, the mic I had to snatch
Back and react like white boys in the mosh pit
The fly shit is easy to get stuck on 
I penned joints for you to vibe to and get you're fuck on
You couldn't last one round 
I suggest you back up off my nuts and put the dick down
You now in tune to the sounds

Decide to take it home kick off my shoes relax and play
And spin it for the whole joint cause I like to get the whole point
Music is everything to me and I refuse to rock the piece
Cause you're my favorite emcee
All I want is what you would ask of me, hi Kwelity
And some Definition
Wonder why we bootleg like it's prohibition
It's difficult it's dismissing
I got suspicions that your ears to the streets where we're whispering
Are you listening?
I took your L-P to D-C, where some youngin's
Gave me the L-D on how it should be
Make sure the beat knock 'til the trunk pop
And everybody pause when you cruise down the block
Roll down your window and they ask what you playin'
But don't nobody care what you're sayin'
That's what they told me y'all

This is a message for our people chasing Benjamin's
With real rhymes and skills they believing in
Keeping them bad tapes rolling like Michellin
It don't matter, cause niggas ain't listening
They ain't listening, they thinkin' bout they timbalands
They say the shit we talk about ain't interestin'
We got a better chance of blowing up in Switzerland
Holla if you hear it cause niggas ain't listening

Music was my sanctuary so I take a long listen
To hip hop living out my life in songs wishin'
My parents I could get along with them
So I would go inside my room and dig deep inside the strong rhythms
Back when fresh was the word, and raw was on prism
Marley on the boards, plus Kane was long livin'
G rap and A spittin' murderous
Bought long live the kane sat down and learned every word of it
Sneakin' my walk man in the homeroom playin' it
Listen for punchlines delivery and cadences
But nowadays it's like niggas wanna play with it
They hear some good shit but don't stop to savor it
Like one night we was out in my whip
With some broads just chillin' playin' demos and shit
Asked 'em how I sounded rockin' the mike
One chicl told me all she listened to was beats, thank god for ninth
Trying to get pressed on vinyl cause motherfuckers buy your CD
But turn around don't even know your song titles
Like track 2 is hot, and track 6 is long
Ain't even listening, I'm hoping I get through to y'all

This is a message for our people chasing Benjamin's
With real rhymes and skills they believing in

Holla if you hear it cause niggas ain't listening

Fly Motorola diploma style ice niggas
Asparagus rosemary chips for all my nice niggas
We roll through niggas masked in vengeance
U-Haul emcees chasing Brown Sugars
And you thought that it would never happen
Thought that it would never happen
My clever rappin' keeps my celery growing
Judy Jetson up in Elroy's thought he was home
With the Gold Bond Armor-All fatigues on
Rosey in the pantry with Velma and Shaggy getting they lean on
He sweeter that a Whitney Hous' track hittin' them high notes
And Alex Keaton always frontin' like he high post
Screaming on Justine when he flippin' the script
Tony Danza left a playa celibate
Rippin' rhymes for the hell of it
Check all these bitches on my Soul Glow city
Walkin round with Madagascar titties
Imported for my Cole Train leaves ya elephant niggas
Yo peace Jovan the sky be purple and orange

Why their played out rhymes remain odd
I stay cool like James Todd and still remain dominant

Up in yo' spot, tonight we steady rockin' it
And I'm gonna knock you out just like mama said
To Lenny, blunt smokes, cigarettes, Henny
But it's somethin' 'bout these hoes, Lord, forgive me

I stepped in about a quarter pass, you know, whatever
I'm tryin' to get up on some ass like whatever
And grab a quick bite by the end of the night
I drain tryin' to complain and knees killin' me, right

But you know we got dat hot shit
Known to rock da block and cause turbulence
When you in da cock pit cool 'cause he don't get upset

And to you rappers takin' all figures

For industry niggas, da ball players
Droppin' 'em off of all makers
Wit yo' whole team in ambulances
We buildin' more beef than cattle ranches
Against the snowstorms and avalanches

Well, it was one of those days
(Not much to do)
I was steady writin' rhymes
(For the Little Brother crew)

Of the two be Phonte and 9th, plus Eccentric
And Big Doe in case I didn't mention
(But did you tell 'em 'bout the League)
Oh yes, the League of Justice
(And did you remember what they need?)
These kids, they want substance

Rhymes and beats keep my day flowin' lovely
But I'ma save crumbs and pass it off to Doug E
This is all about, no doubt for Little Brother
But first let's take a moment to recover

This has been writtin', it's never bitin'
You keep forgettin' the lyrics on tracks that I'm spittin'
The only thing worse are the emcees that I'm rippin'
They talkin' shit and wishin'

Some of these guys getting' all hurked up
From a ghost-writtin' rhyme by a chump, word up
It don't make you a big man, and
To wanna diss Little Brother man, and

We all know, it's part of the plan

Niggas need to slow it down yo
Sit back just chill just relax
Speeding down the roads of life
Yo check it

Another day to face, I'm share cropping in the paper chase
Take a deep breath and clear my database
It's afternoon I'm talking shit to my alarm clock
Cause I gotta face this world of capitalistic onslaught
Don't stop when I jump in the whip, tryin to get it off
Beltline got me rushin like Barichnakof
Pushin 80 miles per hour to this, call center
Tryin to pick up a check I only see twenty percent a
Until the weekend, it sound crazy when I'm sayin it
But sleep is nice, got me forgettin what day it is
Until my son two days with out speakin, looking for
Reasons to keep my heir from goin off the deep end
I take this shit personally, I'm makin moves
But this treadmill lifestyle ain't workin for me
It's from ya crib to ya lab to ya job to make a profit
And at the days end you still got nothing accomplished

Just too fast for me
This really movin too fast for me

But hypnotic tunes like this always do me in
Got a nigga about to go and burn the road again
From first gear to fifth gear out of control again

And that's the way we rolling in, needed to chill
And take a rest stop cause my job got me slaving like
I'm Dred Scott, take a break nah nigga you betta not
Cause that's when the respect stops energy drain
I need a blast like Hi-Tek got so I can grab
The mic and make you're heads bop with the microphone check
One two it don't stop, out of town on a quick
Escape hoping to have a chance to slow it up and hit the breaks

Just too fast for me
This really movin too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you

I write rhymes to incite minds
Spending time on this pipeline, eighty-five
North it's like mine, going eighty five to light minds
Going ninety five to take time
Spending days in the rays of the sunshine
Many days those same rays went undefined
Now forty east is where I go to have my best times
Three lanes going sixty to perfect rhymes
Tre dose and master craft catch punch lines
We turning early morning late night times
Amtrack Monday morning to come back rides
Catch a couch on the weekend, a place I rarely did sleep in
Tay (Phonte) car speaker knobs is tweakin
Cause the way we be rockin it when joints is finished
At the speed we be moving we could never be diminished

With my energy replenished write a rhyme with puns and
All my similes intended speed out until I finish
Keep it on now
We keep it, and keep it, and keep it on now
And keep it, and keep it, we keep it on now
We run it, we do it, we keep it on now
We do it, we did it, we keep it on now
We don't stop

Just too fast for me

Many men's who waiting to stake a claim on it

Soft spoken well dressed dipped out straight chillin'

Ill lemon mixed in it sipping on it I was just chillin'
Til I saw you that's when my heart stopped knees gave
Head sweating jaws locked I was sweating you
Like god damn girl you got a nigga going buck wild,
Mesmerized star struck I was thinking maybe
We can go out like to the movies or the Applebee's
Blockbuster state fair but you looked at me and
Said fuck that you just a herb with no money and
No jeep and no condo and I thought that Little Brother
Had a record deal, OK I see where you going now
Want a sweat a nigga when you think he got a cash advance
And some personal time but fuck that

I got my nigga Young Krysis on the boards

But check it out yo

Uh, I got my headphones steady
And you are not ready, 'cause the flows too heavy
Pooh be navigate over tracks like Mario Andretti
I'm sharp as a machete, you tossin' the confetti

Go against me that's doors on a Chevy sixty four
Dishin', niggaz still pitchin'
Sittin' in the kitchen, bangin' on moms table
The rap Clarke Gable, I'm kinda fly with it

I was blessed with the talent to rhyme
And motherfuckers I'm a die with it
Takin' y'all in the high with it
It's my ship from the captain you wanna take a ride in it?

I'm the truth when I step in the booth
AKA a hundred proof raps gasoline
Americas nightmare but a black mans dream
My eyes on the prize no sacrificin'
That's how we do it man, yeah

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me
Never, D-Brok tell 'em man

Ain't nobody like me

But there's only one Pooh, one true authentic
Uh

It's been five long years since we started this
Group that was targeted, that people so annoyed with fast
And them wannabe niggaz and they gorgeous past
You ask me if I changed, fuck man, of course I have

'Cause I got more records to sell
More dollars to clock, I hate it but that's how it's gotta be
Got more stories to tell, more people to watch
And ten times more people watchin' me

So fuck the masquerade, just let me have a say
I still be spittin' regardless of the accolades
Y'all can take back the mics in The Source
Take back the props from Pete Rock Quest and them boys

Take back the night we did, ""Speed"", at four in the mornin'
Even take back the day I met ninth in the dorm
Y'all can re-write the history to settle the score
And I still be writin' wizardry like never before

'Cause I broke down this year almost lost my clarity
Felt wicked times needed God to carry me
Like, when I found success but lost my family
In the process I will not let you bastards handle me

Lookin' for some guidance, so I figured
I pray to God and He said, Tigga
Low I ain't let you run it back this far
Just so you can go and fumble under one nigga
What he sayin' dog for real?

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me, uh
Yo, you better tell 'em dog

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one Tay one true authentic
What? O-Dash, where you at nigga, man, c'mon?

Keep thinkin' shit gravy man
I heavy man, bet you all a dollar, I can change the game
I ain't gotta change the name, just change the aim
For months we gon' have to rearrange ya frame

Stay strapped on the hip, for those wanna trip
'Cause I got fresh feet on the whip
Man gimme a half I'm like Dominique doors on the flip
No respect when I'm clutchin' ya grip

Paranoia sets in, thinkin' 'bout the time you investin'
Could be gone in a second, that's life in perspective
Ya ace froze, case closed, nigga body found up in Texas
No witnesses to see who that is

That's how I handle my biz, yup for sho'
Might kidnap your broad in exchange for dough
You know how it go

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me
That's how we do it, man, y'all better get it

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one O one true authentic
Yup

Oh yeah
Ain't nobody like me
",Nobody Like Me
Little Brother,"Uh, Deah Pops
It's your boy
I got some things I want to say to you, man
Just a couple of words
Bear with me
Gimme a minute

Time to face it
Sitting in the middle of the basement
Holding a jack
How I'm anticipating he 'gon call me back

Got so much on my mind
Ain't no holding it back
In fact, I give a fuck how he 'gon react
Through my first nineteen

Asking where he at
Never seen him in the spots where we be at
For the next couple hours I sat 'til the phone rang
No luck or no cigar

So I said to myself I'll try tomorrow
Me and my Vincent left out
Went to shoot play some ball
Came back, had message like 'this your pa'
Then I took to the phone

Conversation was raw
Shit, I had to let him know that his child was scarred
And right now we working through our mess
But I had to get some shit off my chest
So bear with me, y'all

[Chorus]
Just want to take the time to let you know
Sometimes it's hard to let my feelings show
The thoughts of guarantees are really so
This is all for you, you

[Phonte]
I was looking at your photograph amazed how I favored you
I remember being young wanting to play with you
Cause you was a wild and crazy dude
And now I understand why my momma couldn't never stay with you
From the roots to the branches to the leaves
They say apples don't fall far from the trees
I used to find it hard to believe
And I swore that I would
Always hold my family as long as I could
But damn
Our memories can be so misleading
It's misery
I hate to see history repeating
Thought you were the bad guy
But I guess that's why
Me and my girl split
And my son is leaving
I did chores, did bills, and did dirt
But I swear to God I tried to make that shit work
'Til I came off tour to an empty house
With all the dressers and the cabinets emptied out
I think I must've went insane
Thinking I was in love, but really in chains
Trapped to this girl through the two-year old who carried my name
I tried to stop tripping
But yo, I couldn't and the plot thickened
That shit affected me, largely
Because I know a lot of people want me
To fail as a father
And the thought of that haunts me
Especially when I check my rear-view mirror
And don't see him in his car seat
So the next time it's late at night
And I'm laid up with the woman I'mma make my wife
Talking 'bout how we 'gon make a life
I'm thinking about child support, alimony, visitation rights
Cause that's the only outcome if you can't make it right
Pissed off with your children feeling the same pain
So, Pop, how could I blame cause you couldn't maintain
I did the same thing
The same thing

[Chorus: x 2]",All for You
Little Brother,"Open my eyes to a new day, spreading my wings
Taking shots of Crown cause I'm going through things
Everybody got they hands out looking for green
Coattails getting heavy cause I'm living my dream
I'm trying to school these young niggas it ain't all what it seems
I still struggle just like you, and I still hustle just like you
But it just so happens that Big Pooh doing what he love to do
Get back to my work, cause I was penning on this piece last night
That'll drive these niggas berserk
Tiggalo hit me up, Pooh its time to murk
Throw on a pair of sweats, A1's, a white shirt
Headed back to the shop, back to the spot where the hits keep coming
Stack them up like bricks, you can call me the mason of shit
Foundation has been rock solid no replacing, ya dig?
No replacing my nig, on everything that I live
We gonna let this bitch ride to our trains collide
Or we fall off track, and ain't no bringing me back
And everything that go for you the same applies to Pat

Cause even though the birds ain't singin' and the sun ain't shinin'
It looks like a beautiful morning

Each day's another chance to do the things I could've
Done the day before, but I didn't and I known I should've
So I say a prayer for the gone for gooders
Who left this world, then kiss my girl ""good mornin', shuga""
Another sunrise, and as much as I would love
To roll over on you I cannot do it because
The good Lord I prayed to him
And he said, ""Niggas is listening now""
So I better have something to say to 'em
So I'mma tell 'em how it went down, man
Doin' shows for free goin' outta town, man
The way I almost broke down and, got a 9 to 5
Cause I had more press than the soundscans
This is the price that I pay for this music
And every word that I write is a testament to it
And if I had to go back, I wouldn't change a thing
Wouldn't re-cut it, re-edit, or change a frame
Cause it would not be fair, to turn my back on the struggle
When that exact same hustle got me here
Told niggas from the getup, we three the hard way
And Broadway's the only place you'll ever throw a set up
Speechless is all you'd be if we ever met up
I survived far to much now to ever let up, motherfucker

Cause even though the birds ain't singin' and the sun ain't shinin'
It looks like a beautiful morning

I went from niggas tellin' me I really shouldn't rhyme
To droppin' a cla-
Ay, hol' up man, hol' up, ayo
Ayo, Imma do it over, hol' on",Beautiful Morning
Little Brother,"I went from niggas tellin' me I really shouldn't rhyme
To droppin' a classic album muhfuckers couldn't find
Took my respect, took lessons and took the time
And if you want a success story, just take a look at mine
I was blessed with the right components, so precise
Cause I write so tight within the moment
And spit like my life depended on it
I target you herbs
On some teleprompter shit I got you watching your words
Tay rhymes are real life, yours are so 'for instance'
Taxin' these niggas like no dependents
12 bar courtroom drama with no co-defendants
Don't beat it off, come to your senses

Hard rock, my block is where you better be from
Top of the line, my team will never settle for crumbs
And he's hated, but still rated 2nd to none
I'm everything you wanna be but have yet to become

It all started back in '99 when time was hard
North Carolina Central but we called it the yard
Cause niggas wasn't trying to study abroad
They was trynna study a broad or two ir three up in the dorms
Met my nigga Chaundon and I started to ponder
""Fuck this, I'mma quit the football team tomorrow""
Did shows around town and word got around that battling Tay
Was like yelling 'spic' in Tijuana
Build my rep up, that's when Pooh and 9th stepped up
9th was old school, Pooh was young and playing catch-up
Cool, cause he could still rock an instrumental
Our first joints, yeah they was wack
But niggas could hear potential in 'em
Honing our skills for survival, hustling
Our flyers passed out like mamma at revival
The real deal on how I repped my peeps
You ain't goin' find this in no press release

Hard rock, my block is where you better be from
Top of the line, my team will never settle for crumbs
And he's hated, but still rated 2nd to none
I'm everything you wanna be but have yet to become

And ""he's shook""
That's what your team is telling me, son
Still hated, but still rated 2nd to none
And Greensboro, cause that's the only 'boro I'm from

Usher in the new era, like this y'all (this y'all)

A distilled emcee, no chemicals
No subliminals

Where you gonna hide?

I'll strangle the air in your throat
Like you jump from a chair and choke
In mid-air from a rope
Got a big gun and carry a scope
The flare of the smoke
Keep niggas quiet like words that librarians spoke
I'm arrogant, outlandish
Blow your face out, and shake out the dandruff
The jakes won't make out the handprints
I'm as real as it gets, with the steel and the clips
Buck and make niggas duck, and kneel and do splits

It gets no realer than this
Its Tay and Elzhi dropping that definitive shit
This should have been a double album commemorative disc
Cause hip-hop might need us
And in your town, no telling where you might see us
My whole team coming through in tees and wife beaters
Out, doin their damn thing like beavers
Yo, its P to the H-O, I finish the job
Plus my Dominican Broad
Making me chili con queso

Work and plan a perfect verse
Then burst like a person
That jerked from a circus cannon
Then landed to the earth
Its me on the song, featured your fleet
Breathing as strong
It's a gypsy reading a palm
With a drawn heater
Never gone off the wrong reefer
A bong chief of the don
Ball as long as LeBron's bronze sneakers
Got ways of a thuggie, thinking I won't come and get you
Dressed like a bum with pistols and AK's in the buggy

And Tay is blazing it lovely, cause I'm one with the game
So I sat back, chilled, dropped Foreign Exchange
And a lot of rap niggas got lost
Heard Phontigga carrying tunes and assumed he don got soft
They didn't understand it was my next direction
So I'm playing postman and addressing questions
Like, yes I'm still a LB, no I'm not leaving
No I don't eat meat, but yes I'm still beefin
But all these wack niggas putting records out
This is all live nigga, check it out

And I ain't worried about people biting ""Minstrel Show""
They still teething on ""The Listening""

Cause ain't no rest for the weary when it comes to my team
We only sleep on December the 32nd
DJ's dissin' the album before they check it
Dealin' with their managers and program directors
And even though I try not to stress it
Sometimes it feels like a waste of time and not worth the effort

Naw but I won't let it
Put a block on my team's hustle for a second
Poobie keep it rushing, as long as Tay and I on the mic
And 9th is on the percussion, these fronting dudes can't say nothing
It was only time for we finally spoke out
Plenty cold nights ahead I suggest you get your coats out
No time to stand here lips poked out we bout to closeout that stored up doubt
And keep it moving

Seems like whatever I do
Its not enough for you
I paid the cost and gave you my all

That I sacrifice and give you my life

Staking my claim just like Nationwide

Took our wax to the station and they straight played us
That's how the game got contaminated
And now they sayin' we're at fault like the San Andreas

And still trying to play us
But not spin the record or disc
I got a fire burning deep that will not be extinguished
I mean this from the depths of my soul
People no more mind talk let my heart take control

And in the middle in the front, come on

Homie, this here is pain
I'm speaking on this pitiful thing
That's now forever stained in the banks of my memory
You probably like, 'they running this, b'
But naw, I'll doubt we'll ever be
Its funny cats don't remember me
And don't think cause we all here that its gonna be all we
Or all love, its all bugged
Trying to mask them emotions with pounds and hugs
No more I say gotta make'em pay
Cause I'm tired of getting stepsonned in the worst way just wait
These chips on my shoulder gettin' stacked
When my pockets catch up Pooh's never turning back

Yo I ain't never heard a actor blow and go global
Then come back home and still be called local
And when we onstage the people they all front
Dope beats, dope rhymes what more do y'all want (shout it out)

No matter who you are (It don't matter), gonna have your ups and downs

Whatever goes around, comes around

Uh, yo, uh I walk, wit' a swag of a letterman
No amateur here, I'm a veteran
You couldn't find many more who is better than
Big Pooh when he rocking the mic
No games, no hype, just mind and skills
Pure determination and a heart full of will
My nigga Tiggalo held me down for real
But it's time now for me to ante up on the bills
Cause at the point when we signed our deal
I was three years young, now I'm five plus some
Write, to the beat of 9th's wonderful drum
Overhung by the snare and the bassline
It's face time, commentators they deface my
Place I pick up the pace, cause I belong here
Marathon man, outlastin the chariot
I got a bone to pick and 'bout to bury it

This letter goes out to whoever want read it (whoever)
Please share it with the world cause I won't repeat it (I won't repeat it)
Believe me, I know who all need it
So for you, I wrote this letter (check it out)
I woke up, wit' an epiphany (Whaaat?)
It's like this feelin came over me (WHAAAT?!)
Cause right is where I'm 'posed to be
So for you, I wrote this letter

Uh, yo I awoke wit' a lot on my chest
And every breath that I took wasn't gettin' any better, P
I swear, some niggas wish they could replace me
No bullshittin, I watched the rumors chase me
'til it had me in the corner, (back down)
I mean, my back against the wall yo, I thought I was a goner
I let the pressure get the best of -
I let words make a mess of what's left of my pride but
I refuse to hide, behind the silence and smiles
It's been a while though, you hearin me now
Remember every foul comment that you motherfuckers spoke?
Well, I Rakim these niggas now, I Ain't No Joke
This is no hoax, back to bench scrubs like Tremaine Foulks
Coast to coast, please put up a toast
For the most, slept on!
Better open your eyes 'fore yo' ass get crept on, surprise

Little Brother,"This some grown man shit right here 
Listen 

I'm trying to man up see what's really good with you 
Gentleman's approach, not bring it hood to you 
Same things that you hear everyday like 
""Hey ma, hey boo, baby what's your name"" 
Please pull up a seat, I'm so glad you came 
My mother call me Thomas you can do the same 
Damn its so refreshing when you calling out my name 
Been Pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same 
My occupation rap and I make a little change 
I see you not impressed with what this life brings 
Finished school, got a job, girl do your thing 
It's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed 
Marry into money or marry into fame, or at least give birth to a check 
With all due respect lets two-step in the name of like 
Who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night, it's like 

[Chorus] 
If love is not enough 
We don't have to rush 
Come around, I'll slow it down just you 
Lady you should be 
Right here next to me 
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you 

We can go to the movies 
I'll take you to the park and promise to have you home before the lights go out 
Steady asking you questions what your life about 
Oh and me, mine's everything I scribe about 
No doubt this my life and 
Dedicated to this witting sacrificing everything for it 
Wasted time I can't afford 
So if it ain't you/then you know I'm cooped up to the record.. 

I'll scoop you up in me Porshe, sike 
You know I got a Nissan 
That I'm still paying for, still got a lease on 
But it don't matter 'cause that ain't my aim to get you 
I got fame, but you know that just ain't the issue 
Because you're looking like a woman of virtue 
So well-rounded, no wonder your're in my circle 
And normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day 
'Cause Tay got rhymes, but no he ain't got time to waste 

[Chorus] 

Sometimes I think I'm from another world (preach) 
When I'm trynna tell a woman just exactly where I stand that (aight) 
I want a girl, when I want a girl 
And when I don't want a girl, I want a girl who understands that 
And that's some hard shit to explain 
To a woman that's in love with you, it's a pitiful thing 
Until I had to figure 
That I don't wanna play around, but I don't wanna settle down 
And that's a man's dilemma, 'cause every man remembers 
How his daddy and his uncles did it 
'Cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it 
I know it sound fucked up and most won't admit it 
But yo, I gotta face it 'cause I know I'm living through it 
'Cause when the party stops and niggas get old 
And the chain and the cars and the houses get sold, and that 
Other side of the bed gets cold, you don't wanna be alone 
So girl I'm trynna hold you

[Chorus] 

Oh baby (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
What you need to do is 
Take it slow with me 
Slow it down a little bit (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
We don't have to rush into anything serious 
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
No we don't, take it from me (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
My name is Percy and I make miracles if you take it slow with me baby 
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)",Slow It Down
Little Brother,"Imagine, if this was the last rhyme I ever wrote
The last words that I ever spoke, no
I'm a keep servin' them
Cause its somebody out there, that never even heard of him
Or the songs I be murdering
Now it's a whole herd of men that follow in his footstep
I did it all to get a rep and it worked out
Now my sisters Kirk out when they hear me on the radio
Here we go with the steady flow
I'm the best since sliced bread but you already know
How it goes when, me and Te be composing
Over instrumentals 9th holding
We not hot niggas scolding, I told men
But it's only now you want to listen
So get close, please pay attention
Here's a few things I'd like to mention
The B the I the G the P the O the O the H
The is none greater
The L the B the J the L
Is here forever money so see me later
Stash away plenty sheets of paper
Shit is perfected and we hit the majors
See, I said you niggaz couldn't cage us
Them mere feeble attempts was outrageous
It aint a party 'til we hit the stages
Rapper Pooh signing off, see you in the funny papers
Ha, you can bet your life on it, you gon see me man come on

Rock, Rock and you don't
Freak, Freak and you don't
To the Beat and you don't
Its unique and you don't
You think I will but I won't, stop
They think I will but I won't, stop

Rock, rock and you don't
Freak, freak and you don't
To the beat and you don't
Its unique and you don't
Big Pooh and he don't stop
And 9th Wonder he don't stop

Even though, most of our albums are poorly promoted
And all the magazines probably won't even quote it
J League never running or folding
We got tight to steal y'all spotlight and y'all won't even know it
One time for Big Pooh cause he quit eating steak
And two times for 9^th Wonder cause he setting it straight
And 3 times to that hoe from the 8-1-4
That moved in, got kicked out and caught on tape (ha,ha)
Just a little bit of time, is all that we granted on this planet
For us to get our little bit of shines
If y'all want to get a line, then talk to Big Dho
Cause ain't shit free but the spirit of my rhymes
I hear it all the time, LB ain't on the same ?
So innovative you the next best things, since, whatever
I just laugh wit it, cause today's fan is tomorrow's rap critic
One day they giving you the thumbs up the next
They telling 9^th to go on switch his drums up the best
Is what they expect, but why they won't let the music
Just be what it is is anybody's guess, so ah
If y'all feeling this y'all ain't gotta analyze it
This shit is dope so we ain't changin' up
Makin' money and our parents ain't ashamed of us
And when I think about that I can't complain as much so let it rock.

Raleigh gotta
Durham gotta
Chapel Hill gotta
Greensboro gotta
High Point gotta
Got a zone

Its for all y'all man

Rock, rock and you don't
Freak, freak and you don't
Its unique and you don't
To the beat and you don't
Think I will but I won't, stop
Think I will but I won't, stop

Rock, rock and you don't
Freak, freak and you don't
To the beat and you don't
Its unique and you don't
Think I will but I won't, stop
They think I will but I won't, stop

Little Brother,"LB be'ness
Yeah, I go by the name of Khrysis
(My nigga Khrysis on the beat)
One half of the Away Team
And right now, you in tuned to the biggest colored show on earth
The Minstrel Show, nigga

I can't afford to not record
So, I call my nig' Khrysis, tell him, hit the boards
Then I call Tay put the pedal to the floor
'Fore we do the shop, gotta stop by the store

I'm on my knees, gotta go to the Lord
(Dear Father)
I pray to You, these niggas gon' pay for it

All them times that I went ignored
So, what it wasn't 20 but still I scored
My heart still scorned and my mind is focused
So, this serves as a warning to protest

Any verse disperse is sicker that the first and
'S no treatment for this disorder, Carolina's number one reporter
A nigga who's back with a vengeance better run for the border
(Run)
Or head for the hills or duck and seek cover
Who else gon' make it hot this summer? It's LB, nigga

They can't stop me, naw, they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin', I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

They can't stop me, dawg, they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin', I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

Uh, ain't no need in gettin' teary eyed
(Whoo)
Tay's the illest, point blank period
Plus, I got niggas , in DC
That'll hit you for 3G's and a box of Yum's carry out

Outlook lookin' scary now
They was frontin' before but now they seein' that we serious
This ain't a peace talk, so muhfucka, save your sweet talk
(Suite)
For reservations at the Marriott

They say birds of a feather often flock together
But me and Big Pooh rock together
And if not forever
I'ma reach to the sky and keep flyin' high like we got propellers

'Goddamn, y'all boys doin' it', they stop to tell us
And if God propel us to the top, I won't go pop
(Pop)
No need to act a fool in public
'Cause when you, ego trip you just lose your luggage and well
I ain't got no time top play with 'cha

I'm Phonte, international stage ripper done
Made friends and made figgas while you stuck on the front porch
Mad, like you fixin' ta shave Mister
(You fixin' to shave)
That's reality, so color me purple

My name in history, nigga, that's what I work for
Better keep it moving like the laws of inertia
Before these Carolina boys come hurt 'cha
Better tell 'em bout it

They can't stop me, naw, they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin', I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

They can't stop me, dawg, they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin', I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

And now The Minstrel Show is proud to present
Jazzy Jeff, Khrysis on the board with, with the heat
(Jeff, Jeff, Jeff)

Fuck that, I got your head still bobbin' and my verse to be rhymed
And to my man, Jazy Jeff

Little Brother,"Ye-yeah, one more time, one last number
Chaundon, where you at, nigga?
It's the future right here, man
We startin' it right now, let's get it goin', Big Pooh, uh

My attitude real shitty, temper short
My mind cluttered like the streets of New York
I ain't tryin' to take a ""L"" 'cause I casually fought
This shit, real serious not casual sport

Let time fly by as I pen these thoughts
And I'm speedin' through life wit my car in park
And even in the day sometimes it's dark
And that cloud hoverin' low is not the worst part

Second guessin' yourself, tryin' to remain sharp
See niggas blowin' up, who ain't got yo, spark, uh
And that alone is a burden to carry
Either you'll get strong or you'll get buried

And rap keep plenty room in the cemetery
Pull out your Blackberry's, change yo itineraries
I mean you could be the shit today
Then tomorrow wake up, fame blown away

And homey, on the real, ain't nothin' you can say
That's why I work hard now, got later to lay
In the sands on the beach, mixin' drinks wit Belvy
The world gon' remember my name, motherfuckers

Now they heard some of yo' songs and peeped you from the side
And watched yo videos and seen the car you drive
Chill and we know what to expect, my nigga
Done seen it all before, I ain't impressed, my nigga

But they heard some of our songs and peeped us from the side
And came out to the shows and seen us on the grind
Chill and this is how we get down, motherfuckers
We don't care who got next, this is now, motherfuckers

I tried to work with niggas, don't wanna jerk them niggas
But everybody runnin' around thinkin' they murderers
Gave birth to niggas and when I burp them niggas
The spit up old lines that I fed to them earlier

And this is what the state of hip-hop is like
I'm thinkin', ""Damn, this cannot be right""
And I agree that everybody's a biter but if you Xerox the style
Then that's infringin' on my copy, right?

It's the bottom of the 9th with no extra innings
And we all in the game tryin' to collect our pennants
And from the old school, I'm a direct descendant
And y'all can feel it at the end of each and every sentence

'Cause underground rap is just incense and gimmicks
An image, they phone in for ten cents a minute
I knew that since I entered, the rap game, my style
Would have niggas takin' it back but what about now?

I think about the youth and how their minds are so closed
'Cause now ""Rap City"" look like ""Video Soul""
And that's a sad state of affairs but no need to despair
'Cause we the next ones that's takin' it there, ya know

Now they heard some of yo songs and peeped you from the side
And watched yo videos and seen the car you drive
Chill and we know what to expect, my nigga
Done seen it all before, I ain't impressed, my nigga

But they heard some of our songs and peeped us from the side
And came out to the shows and seen us on the grind
Chill and this is how we get down, motherfuckers
We don't care who got next, this is now, motherfuckers

A note to my opponents, yeah, I got now
And I always got next 'cause I seize every moment
I'm an opportunist with ambition, keep an eye
On that number one spot before it wind up missin'

And the heart of this being is the art of MC-in'
I feel I'm God with the flow 'cause people started believin'
Huh, so what I'm cocky, who gon' stop me?
Twist hoes, leave 'em knock knead, smile for paparazzi

This is how I get down, got a crib in every hood
So I'm always the hottest nigga in town
Hate it or love it, who fuckin' with our music?
Yeah, y'all niggas are the shit when it comes to bowel movements

Pooh showed and proved it, can't sleep on his game
'Te converted all the currency with foreign exchange
Up next to rock the booth is a rapper named Chaundon
The Bronx Borough President with ""No Excuses""

Doubtin' me is foolish, don't ask who produced this
Knowin' damn well only 9th can do this, huh
It's no secret, Lyor even know
When me and Little Brother flow, it's guaranteed another video

Now they heard some of yo songs and peeped you from the side
And watched yo videos and seen the car you drive
Chill and we know what to expect, my nigga
Done seen it all before, I ain't impressed, my nigga

But they heard some of our songs and peeped us from the side
And came out to the shows and seen us on the grind
Chill and this is how we get down, motherfuckers
We don't care who got next, this is now, motherfuckers

On behalf of myself, Phonte, Big Pooh and 9th Wonder
And the whole cast of 'The Minstrel Show'
I wanna thank y'all for watchin' this shit
I ain't gon' front, only reason I took this job
'Cause I need the money, I don't need, yo, I ain't gon' front

I don't give a fuck if UBN pull the plug on me, dawg, I-I gotta be real
Y'all really wanna know how I feel about 'The Minstrel Show'?
Y'all really wanna know how I feel about UBN?
These goddamn crackers get on my motherfuck

That everybody dancin' to
And when I play it it kind of remind me of me and you
I mean, it's it's one more thing I wanna talk about now look
It's It's It's time now for you to come home now
Look everybody got there problems I'm dealin' with mine
I I I done gave up my narcotic, I'm a changed man!

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, how many ways can I say I'm done fishin?
You wanted the role, smashed the audition
Havin' a partner for a man in my position
Eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women
And some say that it was the life I was given
I say it don't matter if I work at Mickey D's
I still got a fix for what you got between your knees
On a new broad, you still one to one
Every once and again I like havin' some fun
No disrespect intended but what's done is done
Women steppin' out for love, men do it to cum
""Not a Player"" like Pun, but when shorty's get to grabbin' on me
The last thought I get is, ""Poobie run! ""
To them girls wishin' all the starters will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is, hon - One!

[Chorus: Phonte (R&B Sample)]
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin' my heart (Don't go breakin' my heart)

[Lil Wayne (R&B Sample)]
Yeah! She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think bout leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin' my heart (Don't go breakin' my heart)

[Verse 2: Phonte]
We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens
Every mornin', and every ev-ening
Ten years later, she eatin' that Lean Cuisine
I'm on the field, straight brawn off that Creatine
In the NFL - which mean Not For Long
City to city, all the groupies they hop along
Word get back, the wifey she like, ""Stop the song""
""I'm takin' the kids to my momma's, I'm out, I'm gone!"" Whoa!
Momma was like, ""Baby now, I hate to see your tears
But I been with your daddy for bout 35 years and in my day, I had to
Turn a blind eye to cheatin'
But I ain't never had to wear no black eyes from beatings
As long as he doin' right, by you and the kids
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is?
I ain't sayin' that it's right, but we often pay the price
Cause a woman's life is love, a man's love is life
And he gon' live it to the fullest,
And I ain't tryna pull you down, or sound like a broken record
But you should know by now that all! Niggas is dogs
Better to have a rich Pit than a broke German Shepard, uh! ""

[Chorus: Phonte x2]
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin' my heart (Don't go breakin' my heart)
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin' my heart (Don't go breakin' my heart)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Word up, I say I don't have nothin' If I don't have you
Like Sade, you got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep like the first tattoo
I gets all in your head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey! Girl don't play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like the Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
Yeah! You gotta hold your soldier down
Even when the war is lookin' like, it is right around the corner
And you don't wanna leave me believe me
Cause I can turn you on like, a personal TV
It's Young Weezy, I know what you thought
But I'm just here to play my part so, don't go breakin' my heart

[Rapper Big Pooh]
My momma told me that this music was cool
All she ever wanted from me was to graduate from school
But I, had other plans so I bid school adieux
I called Food Lion, had to tell 'em I was through
No more stockin' peas and corn
I was born for a much greater purpose, do you this service
Margie got nervous, but timers don't sweat
8 years, I ain't been back yet
Lack of time on your TV sets, no radio spins
Momma askin' her son, what he doin' for ends
Spendin' weeks on the road, ma this ain't for pretend
Unheard to the creme de la creme, keep bouncin'
On beats pouncin', cat reflexes
Had yo' attention when I pulled up in Lexus
Big like Texas, G's on the checklist
You ain't gotta ask ma I'm bringin' home the breakfast
Gotta respect this

[Chorus]
(Momma I got dreams, but dreams don't keep the lights on)
I'm a make money money
And if I can't make it I'm a take money money
What you say buddy buddy?
(Momma I got dreams, but dreams don't keep the lights on)
Bills paid, bank account ensured
Top of the world screamin' fuck that, get yours!

[Phonte]
I still go the crib and see my niggaz on the corner
Chillin' with the pounds on they waist, gettin' old
Gettin' round in the face and when I hang with them
They ask me if ""The Minstrel Show"" means I'm ashamed of them
Well, I can't say that I'm proud, but only sayin'
Can't say I'm allowed to judge, I'm just glad to see you
Cause truth be told, if my records never sold
And I wasn't raised this bold, nigga I would probably be you
I've been God blessed with the gift to make music
It took me all over the continent
But still got boys on the block and fam, smokin' rock
So please, miss me with that conscious shit
I spent many a sleepless night because of it
Until I had to shake that shit off and reach the conclusion
That every now and then you gotta axe yourself
Do you really wanna win or just look good losin?
It's no illusion, yes yes

This a provocative-ass beat my nigga! I ain't gon' lie
Like, this shit so hard, it's so provocative
Before I could do it I had to go get a manicure, a pedicure
A cucumber melon facial wrap
And now nigga I'm spittin' this shit, I got on a raspberry colored mockneck
And some Babajeux cologne, Oh!

Chances are I've raised the bar
Never first at the finish but here I are
Niggaz gettin' out of hand 'til I raised the par
Yeah I took a few lumps, I don't easily scar
And after number two heard they tried to tar, but baby I'm back
Now I see folks tryin' to sit where I sat
Shakin' my hand like shit! It's like that?
And this is all fact

[Phonte]
All factual, all actual
Now they lookin' at me, eyes all glassy now
From the chicken-head hoes with the weaves and perms
To the coffee-shop bitches with the naturals

Now they all wanna know how they can be down
Didn't think I'd make it rhymin', but I'm still grindin'
Look at 'Te shinin', are you happy now?

[Chorus: Rapper Big Pooh, Phonte]
Everybody say praise the lord
Ain't another like me, I swear to God
Everybody wanna be amongst the stars
So now I gotta go and do it extra hard

New aim, new game, fresh feet on the car
Don't ever let a nigga tell you who you are
So when you gotta show 'em, go extra hard
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)

Get into weights, mix berry protein shakes

Let me hear another word, I ex-pose fakes
I done took all the shit I'm a take, that's word

Say word on the street is, 'Te stay flowin'
Just show him where the beat is
It'd be so nice if he wasn't an elitist, bullshit homey!
I'm a grown-ass man, just call it as I see it
Flow so dumb it's borderline genius
All the way from NC to Phoenix
We get bread and it spreads like an epidemic
'Te three point oh nigga this is the remix
I done upgraded y'all, catch up, uhh

Uh! Everybody thinks I'm crazy
Cause I don't do what they do

Nobody wants to see you when you're down and out
These niggaz gon' turn their backs on you
Wish that they could see me now

""The one thing that, the black audience realized, is when the tower fell
There were some changes. There was a change in societies, where where
All of a sudden they went from being, somewhat of the people still having a say
To now it's, whatever the masses do. So there's not even really a choice
That a black audience is being given.""

[Rapper Big Pooh]
They talk about us, not usin' the word nigga
I wanna speak about a couple issues much bigger
Like most black folks live below the poverty line
And they wonder why the fuck! we attracted to crime
Got niggaz shootin' niggaz at the drop of a dime
Babies in the street die way before they time
Many single parent mothers packin welfare lines
And niggaz bein' donors, the apocalypse is on us
Niggaz take owners, that's all I ever asked
And got pegged as a hater, man they tryin'' to take niggaz
Out with the fader, started with three
Down to two-six later, back independent
Cause to kids I wouldn't cater

Yes sir, one time, uhh, uhh, yo
I came back from NY, a nigga lost his deal
Felt sick to the stomach, almost lost his meal
Lost friends from way back, and on top of all that
They tryin to blame this rap shit for all of our ills
Like I can stick you up with a mic
Like I can rape you with a verse or use a verb as a knife
Like before Kool Herc, everything was alright
Like y'all wasn't callin' black women hoes before' ""Rappers Delight""
Sheeeit! That's just idiot talk, this whole shit is a farce
I refuse to be hip-hop's pallbearer
Had to tell me son cut that bullshit off
Them ain't videos nigga, that's psychological warfare
Too many different variations of the same face
Designed to keep yo' broke ass in the same place

I heard a choir singing.
I saw my love walk down the aisle.
On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man.
I heard them promise 'til death do us part.
Each word was a pain in my heart.

Oh.  All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.

And now the wedding is over,
rice has been thrown over their heads.
For them, life has just begun but mine is at an end

With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,

In your words I'm the bully of the playground
Just taking from the loving of the worn down

But when I judge, I judge for us
Our fates in trial, your life in trust
The sense of right in what we do
But who am I to judge for you

When sex is so easy in distraction
And my life just public masturbation
The hunger for fame is so contagious
But I smile as if saying so outrageous
What you say is so outrageous",My Nature
Little Cub,"Winter blues
I smile 'cause you want me too
The reddest of eyes
The coldest goodbyes from you
But it's not snow that has been falling
I watched you dance last week
Round this I see streets
But it's no the cold
When this has been bothering me
And it's not snow glistening on my cheek

Another silent night
Just a holy night
With just a quiet goodbye

Feel the night is closing in
See the lights in my childish grin
The city is cold
The boats are all frozen in
But in the snow why I am sinking
And you're the chip on my shoulder

In a world of somber faces
Would you know who's really sad
When there's one who's sees that smiling
Who knows is lucky will watching hard
'Cause I know that there are limits
To the days I feel like this
But these angels that we may have disobeyed

Another silent night
Just a holy night
With just a quiet goodbye",Snow
Little Cub,"You've been caught out wanting
Something shameful

Don't be so cold with me right now
It's not sinful now 

Won't you slow down with me
I'll be gentle
Your virtues make me want you

Strip down natural

Don't let your father stop you
From being who you are

Can't face wanting your harm",Television
Little Cub,"I always thought I could take as I wanted
They use to call me their beautiful boy
But though I took my fill from all that I fancied
Those I fancied I would seek to destroy
Just a shagger not a lover of consequence
The kind of lover that just loves to be free
'Cause baby I put the con in confidence
And what you're offering has no value to me

And if I had to ask a personal question
I'd probably ask you what you're wanting to drink
I've had my share and taken more than I've given
But when the choice is mine I'd rather not think
So if you're feeling like I take you for granted
I'm very sorry feelings just aren't my thing
I never waited on the things that I wanted
Conscience and cowardice are still the same thing

But what's left of me
And if you cut me open
I know what you would find
The hollow generation
Inside a gilded mind

And though I'm really not the type you can talk to
It seems it's cute that I have nothing to say
I only smile and do my best to undress you
It's not protection I was programmed this way
So if you're counting that we all have a conscience
I'll be hanging out with all of your friends
'Cause baby I put the con in confidence
And I'll only leave you down in the end

But what's left of me
And if you cut me open
I know what you would find
The hollow generation
Inside a gilded mind

And if you cut me open

And covered in ice was my window top
I say goodbye, I wave my hand
As a thousand doves fly
Across the blackened night

We make sure we gain, then we leave it
‘Cause we’re a nation of forgetters
Oh, after the rain we pretend
It’s easier to begin without looking back

‘Cause all at once air so thin
And there’s nothing left to breathe in

After the rain we forget

Behind the dream so rosy and red
A pile of things to forget
A voice of the past tiptoes in
A cracking, a ghost whispering

After the rain we forget
We make sure we gain, then we leave it
‘Cause were a nation of forgetters

After the rain we forget

Have you been hiding in your big houses?
And people, after the rain, will your life

A lasso in high speed make a perfect knot around my knees

I wanna call it forever call

Oh from a vision I recall your presence in a zoom
Now loving words are faint 'cause I'm to tight in your embrace, oh oh

Want to call it forever call

I wanna call it forever call

Romance blooming smells so nice out plays any harmonies

You blow a kiss back
Then time stops until she turns her back

The swarm of heads turn around
And cross the street, oh

Were made to go his way

No it doesn't look so good to me 
No it doesn't look so good at all

And I've tried everything that whiskey cures

And now I'm feeling that pain 
I put my pride in my pocket

Let me unwind please give me a hole to recline in

And asked if he had a place for me 
His hair was cut off and he was wearing a suit 
And he said not in my house, not in my house 
You look like you're part of a conspiracy

Trying to get to Waco 'fore it freezes over

She'll never know that she drove him away 
As a coward I admire his courageous ways

His life is as a shell; he left it back at Stateside 
I'd say he's doin' pretty well without his shell

The beauty of the sunrise and sunset 
To his friends he wish he could tell

Was the night that the rain, it froze on the ground
Down the street I heard such a sorrowful tune
Comin' from the place they call the Spanish Moon

Well I stepped inside, and stood by the door
While a dark-eyed girl sang, and played the guitar
Hookers, and hustlers, filled up the room
I heard about this place they call the Spanish Moon

One false step, you get done in
It's a cold situation
If that -- that don't -- kill you soon
The women will down at the Spanish Moon

I pawned my watch, and I sold my ring
Just to hear that girl singing, (hear that girl sing)
Don't take long, to wake up ruined

dos and don'ts of cultural etiquette 
The riddles of the politically correct 
These are all things I don't seem to get 
I'm all adrift in her garden set

Staggers the imagination 
Found myself down at the old log inn 
Swattin' skeeters and remembering 
Dimpled chin on her pretty little face

Borderline blues 
On the run in another city 
Another country far from home 

Walk slow and listen, the soul says it all 
Silent conversations 
Borderline blues far behind me 
There lies my destiny 

Wating for me, waiting for me 
It's takin' me a long time 
Long lost from sleeping 
I'm coming home, I'm coming home 

One more night 
Hold on, hold on 
One more night 
With these borderline blues 

From a whisper to a shout 
Before the flame burns out 
Tomorrow is forever 
So hold on one more night 

Borderline blues 
I see the coast, the stars 
Spread to the four corners of the world 
Free for just an instant 

As I fell back down to earth 
It's not enough to care anymore 
Not enough room to hide 
Troubles come and go 

But the child remains inside (inside) 
One more night 
Hold on, hold on 
One more night 

With these borderline blues 
From a whisper to a shout 
Before the flame burns out 
Tomorrow is forever 

So hold on one more night

At the boy with the Texas plates
Momma was starting to worry
I said momma, it's way too late

Four wheels in my favorite color
Gonna roll me away
This time there ain't no other
This time I can't be saved

Ain't no curve that I can't handle
Ain't no mountain I can't climb
So young and foolish
I was driving blind
With my heart wide open
It was just a matter of time
I didn't see the signals
I was driving blind, driving blind

Got bombs in my pocket
Got dreams in my head
Everyday feels like the 4th of July
Everything's painted cherry red

Somewhere in middle America
I'm standing in the rain
Gonna try to walk on water
Find somebody that feels the same

Roll down the window
The freeway is clear
Suddenly all my passions re-appear

I know the power of innocence
Learned the meaning of fate
Rode a dream all the way down to the ocean
Watched it tumble in the waves

Perseverance pulls me
It's gonna take me way
I want it so badly
This time I can't be saved, I can't be saved

Ain't no curve that I can't handle
Ain't no mountain I can't climb

Stomp stomp stomp (wicked clown  wicked town) 

Take a look around  tell me what'cha see 
You see flames and smoke  then there's me 
I'm burning house and jumping telephone poles 
They call me fireface  I'm sucking hot coals 
Give me a quarter  I'll buy a quarter worth of gas 
Sneek in your house and slowly pour it in your ass 
Blaze it up  you're running around screechin scorn 
Your ass is burning, your nuts pop like popcorn 
And when I see you, I stomp all the flames out 
Stomp your face and your ass, stomp your titties 
I'll stomp your balls, we stomp in my wicked town 
Forks up and forks down, a wicked clown 
I represent like a true gangbanger should 
I paint the forks and kays in your neighborhood 
And when you see me, give a nod, say what up 
Then walk away or I'll stomp your fuckin mouth shut 
When I'm done, I drink a couple gallons of gas 
Then I stick a lighter in my ass 

Yeah, so if you down with the fucking clown 
Check it out! 

I says stomp you say woowoo 
STOMP woowoo STOMP woowoo 

Guess who's coming to your big town

Little Feat,"Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run
Galveston, oh, Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying
In the sun, at Galveston, at Galveston",Down on the Farm/Candy Man Blues
Little Feat,"She don't look like her mother 
Nothing like her father
How else can you explain it must be something in the water

Pig tails, overalls, freckles on her face
Skinny as a toothpick turned side ways, 
Something happened to her when she turned sixteen, 
From a little Dixie Chicken to a Mississippi Queen, 

She spent her days a fishin' with a bamboo cane 
Every night skinny dippin' in the Pontchartrain
If you were living breatin', had two feet
You would be stalking that girl cause she looked so sweet

You could always find her when the night time fell, 
Drinkin' of a bucket from an old stone well, 
Drinking from her hand, 
Dancing to the moon, 
She don't look like her mother, nothing like her father, 
How else can you explain it must be something in the water. 

I never will forget that look in her eye
The night she took me down to the riverside, 
She wrapped herself around me like a honey suckle vine
An let me have a taste of wild cherry wine
You could always find her when the nighttime fell 
Drinking of a bucket from an old stone well
Drinking from her hand 
Singing to the moon
She don't look like her mother
Nothing like her father
Folks round here say it's something in the water

Two straight months without any rain
I never ever saw that girl again
But I still got her picture
Burning in my head
Dancing in a downpour 
Soaking wet
You could always find when the night time fell
Drinking of a buck of an old stone well
Drinking from her hand howling at the moon
She don't look like her mother nothing like her father
How else can you explain it must be something in the water
She don't look like her mother nothing like her father
Folks round here say it something in the water",Something in the Water
Little Feat,"Well all you ladies gather 'round
That good sweet candy man's in town
It's the candy man
It's the candy man

He likes a stick of candy just nine inch long1
He sells as fast a hog can chew his corn
It's the candy man...

All heard what sister Johnson said
She always takes a candy stick to bed

Don't stand close to the candy man
He'll leave a big candy stick in your hand

He sold some candy to sister Bad
The very next day she took all he had

If you try his candy, good friend of mine,
You sure will want it for a long long time

His stick candy don't melt away
It just gets better, so the ladies say",Candy Man Blues

Wouldn't believe the shit we've been through
Mark my words, better me than you

We was brought up in a battle ground

They been sent the way 'cause we were bound
To bear the burden of what went down

It was our business
Even if it hurt we were self righteous
Social services parked outside
Tried to take us away

A little bit tougher every time we die
A little better 'cause at least we tried
A little bit nicer 'cause we know we fly

Why your clothes be dirty'
Why your hair all messy'
Why you look so ill'
Couldn't pay the water bill

Had to keep the light on for the homework
So excuse us, we got a couple of quirks
I trivialize 'cause the truth hurts
So much more than a little dirt
Even if it's all bottled up inside
It's a lot more noble than a suicide

We survive, we alive, we got pride
We be tight
You know we ride to a certain degree
To keep that shit in the family

We get a little bit closer every time we ride
A little bit tougher every time we die
A little better 'cause at least we tried
A little bit nicer 'cause we know we fly

That's how we roll in my family

Than it does to hate

Ain't never really dissipates
May take my whole life to get it straight
But it makes me who I am
And I wouldn't trade that for nothin'

Has a little bit of truth

Who be hollerin'?, they could go to hell

Gonna make her my bride

Our lips gonna collide

Will eventually be a problem

One foot out the door, it's like a dance, flip it
There was a relationship

If you don't get a grip, stop giving that lip
You got that fed up, better give some head up
Instead of eating all his butter

Little Jackie,"I liked you better before you knew me
You didn't smoke cigarettes, you didn't drink coffee
Drank moderately, now you're an alkie
You didn't even curse when I was a mystery

Back then, back when you didn't know me at all
I thought I caught a nice guy who caught my eye
You didn't have a care, you didn't have a clue
But seems I brought the worst out in you

One day I passed by your apartment
Thinking that I'd catch some girl
Kiss you goodbye with a lingering kiss
I know we broke up, I'll get out of this faze

My imagination gets the best of me
You end up getting the rest of me
The obsessed, crazy, drama queen
If you know what I mean

Anyway, you're never there
You could be anywhere
On an airplane, maybe in a car
On a world tour being a superstar

I liked you better
When you didn't know no better
You didn't think that I was
I was the Antichrist

I liked you better
Before you got a stylist
When friendship bracelets sufficed
But now your wrists are iced

I liked you better before you knew me
You didn't smoke cigarettes, you didn't drink coffee
Drank moderately, now you're an alkie
You didn't even curse when I was a mystery

Back then, back when you didn't know me at all
I thought I caught a nice guy who caught my eye
You didn't have a care, you didn't have a clue
But seems I brought the worst out in you

Five stitches of breaking up started with denial
Fuck, we were just taking off for a while
Thought it was permanent
Better get myself some anger management

Bargaining was the next faze
Gave my word that I changed my ways
I swear to God, I'll be a freakin? little angel
Please just stop putting me through hell

But he didn't buy what I was selling
I spent about a month on Saturn
Dwelling on the past, at last it occurred to me
You didn't give a damn, time to get with the program

I liked you better
When you weren't popular
Before your friends started calling me
The psycho bitch

Trends didn't matter to you
But now you're all into the way you look
Your iPhone ringing off the hook
And my new ring tone
Is the theme of the wicked witch

I liked you better before you knew me
You didn't smoke cigarettes, you didn't drink coffee
Drank moderately, now you're an alkie
You didn't even curse when I was a mystery

Back then, back when you didn't know me at all
I thought I caught a nice guy who caught my eye
You didn't have a care, you didn't have a clue
But seems I brought the worst out in you

It's like night and day, it's like Jekyll and Hyde
I've created a monster, it's alive
I miss the person I was before I became possessed
And the object of everything you detest

I liked you better before you knew me
I liked you better before you knew me
Back then, back when you didn't know me at all
I liked you better before you knew me

You didn't even curse when I was a mystery

Little Jimmy Dickens,"Here's a rose from the garden where the bloom of romance grows
But I'll keep one part near my aching heart just a petal from a faded rose
Love is sweet in the morning when the breeze of summer blows
But will fade and die when the winter's nigh a petal from a faded rose

Now our love is a memory where it's gone nobody knows
But I'll hold so dear as a souvenir just a petal from a faded rose
I will live with the roses where the stream of mem'ry flows
And each time I dream a tear will gleam on the petal from a faded rose",A Petal from a Faded Rose

Kill what's inside of you.

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue,
In her own mad mind she's in love with you.
With you.
Now what you gonna do?

She's some kind of demon messing in the glue.
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you.
To you.
What kind of fool are you?

She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored.

I'll be there to cry for you
I will share the pain with you

When your heart's not feeling blue
I'll be there to laugh for you

How else can I say I love you?

With each word that I speak
I'll speak of your charm
Each moment in life
Let me spend in your arms

When you're alone, nothing to do
And no one to turn to
I'll be hope when you cry
I'll be breath if you sigh
I'll be yours till I die

How else can I say I love you?

Little Jimmy Scott,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

To love you

Little Jimmy Scott,"Seems that I read, or somebody said
That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that's so but I tried to go
And leave you behind, what did I find

I took a trip on the train
And I thought about you,
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you,

Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

At every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue,

I peeked through the crack
And looked at the track
The one going back to you
And what did I do
I thought about you",I Thought About You [*]
Little Joe,"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.

Little Joe,"I stood in line and left my name
Took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
Said they'd let me know
I put in my time till the Pocono line
Shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
Now I can't stay there no more

Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
To move some old cars around
Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
Van and do a little settlin' down
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
And the junkyard's a pretty good ways
That job's about a half week old besides
It'd be gone now anyway

Unemployment said I got no more checks
And they showed me to the hall
My brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
A little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
We're headed down into fall

I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
Hustled up a little dough
But I got drunk and I woke up rolled
A couple of months ago
They got my harp and they got my dollar
Them low life so and so's
Harps cost money and I ain't got it
It's my own fault I suppose

The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
Two freights everyday
If it was just me I'd be headed south
But Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
Says we gotta wait and see
In my heart I know it's a little boy
Hope he don't end up like me

Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
Hope she don't break down and cry

Marie she didn't wake up this morning
She didn't even try
She just rolled over and went to heaven
My little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
Caught a Chesapeak on the fly
Marie will know I'm headed south
So's to meet me by and by

Marie will know I'm headed south
So to meet me by and by",Marie

Reciting the words he hope she might pursue
Night upon night of faithful eye at shore

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Give me a second I,
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a cup
'Cause I found someone to carry me home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)
The world is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
The end is never right
But I can hear the choir
So will someone tell them carry me home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

We are young

They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

But I've been thinkin' maybe you would change your mind
If you could see me now

Drop me in the ocean, I'll swim
Put me in with the lions, I'll roar
There's a survivor within
So much stronger than I was before

I'd gotta leave that behind

Come and save me
Don't need those other lovers

Slept through to Monday.
Oh. Why Can't it all just go away.
If life was a simple.

Come down my angel.
Come and help me fly.
Come down my sweet angel and tell me why.

Lonely highways.
A cry to stay awake.
But you give me hope
Look back to see you
Before the nights through
Oh I can never feel alone

Come down my angel.
Come and help me fly.
Come down my sweet angel and tell me why.

We know,
That life goes by,
By just like the wind
And I

Come down my angel.

Maybe he's right
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe what I'm saying is the way it should be
Nobody knows when the truth goes by
But everyone tells me that he's happy

Maybe he's gone and found some love
I want to see it for myself
Everyone says just to let him alone
But I can't even sleep no more it worries me so

Why
Why

Maybe I'm right
Maybe he's wrong
And maybe what he's saying is the way it should be
Somebody tried to explain it to me
But they couldn't tell me if he's happy
And I just want to know if he's still happy

Standin' to my Daddy's knee,
My poppa said, ""Son, don't let the man get you
Do what he done to me.""
'Cause he'll get you,
'Cause he'll get you now, now.
And I can remember the fourth of July,
Runnin' through the backwood, bare.
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin',
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.

Chorus:
Down on the Bayou;
Down on the Bayou;
Down on the Bayou.

Wish I was back on the Bayou.
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen.
Wishin' I were a fast freight train,
Just a chooglin' on down to New Orleans.

Do it, do it, do it, do it. Oh, Lord.
Oh get back boy.

You gotta keep fighting for your life, don't you ever give in, it's such a sensless suicide, letting the needle win, oh, you gotta keep fighting for your life, don't you ever give in, it's such a sensless suicide, letting the needle win, don't let the needle win, don't let the needle win, no don't you ever give in, don't let the needle win.

Little River Band,"We are riding on our rainbow
It's nearly at an end
It was given as a promise 
To each and every man
It's a long time since we started 
And the days left now are few
It seems the words sent long ago were true

Life goes on forever
But it changes like the tide
There's a meaning for existence
No need to run and hide
We are fighting for our freedom
We are searching for a way
And we live in hope of some eternal day

We are waiting, we're impatient
We're unfaithful, we are true
There's a lesson in the learning 
Of the different things we do
As it was in the beginning
It shall be at the end
We will come full circle to begin again

Search your heart before you die
Is the cost way too high
To explain all the tears 
We have caused throughout the years
When everything is finished 
And we've done all that we can
Will we come full circle to begin again",Full Circle

Is teaching me something new

I'm walking in the dark alone, close the door
A thousand years or more
Until my guiding light comes shining through

Morning star how you found me wandering near and far
This wounded memory wears like a scar
They all say time will heal
But they don't know how I feel

You know in the end, when the heartache is gone

Easily, we could see each other's point of view

Don't claim to be something different than you are

Eagerly, I thought I was free, under your control
To break out and live, I need more than you can give

Moon rode high on a silver cloud
An air of tension in a room of wonder
She held you gently but you cried out loud

Your old man called from across the sea
The search or fame had taken him away
Out in the heat were a thousand voices
Singing his praise and making him great

You were born to be the lonely one
He was reaching out for number one

He's so busy with all his plans, got no time for his greatest fan, his son
Son of a famous man keeps on giving you alibis
You keep wearing the same disguise, the son, son of a famous man

You were torn from your sleep one night
The winds of change made you come of age
Down in the street was a sea of silence
They couldn't heal you but they shared your pain

You were left to be the lonely one
Now you know you're not the only one

I sit at home, alone and wonder if you're all right
I count the hours and lie awake until you return
And search my mind with overtime
I've so much to learn
Well I gave you everything from the depths of my heart
From the day you took my ring we drifted apart
I have one thing more to say
""You're driving me out of my mind.""
So alone, the home we had has turned out its lights
I walk the floor and wonder who is sharing your nights
And all around, your sound, your thoughts are ever so near
It's hard to take, this wait
I'm always wanting you here
Well I gave you everything from the depths of my heart
From the day you took my ring we drifted apart
I have one thing more to say
""You're driving me out of my mind.""
Though it may be hard to see
If you change your mind, will you know just where I'll be
If you ever need me
Feeling bluesy, you know you do confuse me all night
I sit at home, alone and wonder if you're all right
And all around, your sound
Your thoughts are ever so near
It's hard to take, this wait

It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

Staring at the full moon, like a lover
Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change

Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change
Well I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best

The albatross and the whales they are my brothers
There's lots of those friendly people
And they're showing me ways to go
And I never want to lose their inspiration

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

I've never been romantic
And sometimes I don't care
I know it may sound selfish
But let me breathe the air

Let me breathe the air...

And it's there that I feel my best

Trade it in.

From somewhere deep inside the inner man.
Are you always in confusion?
Surrounded by illusion?

Sort it out.
You'll make out.
Seem to make a good beginning
Someone else ends up winning.

Don't seem fair.

Little River Band,"I was born near the factory, where Henry wrote his name
Sometimes I could hear the whistle blow
My father pushed his headlights, through that northern English rain
He was proud of everything he drove

And mother's hair was fashioned, for that very special day
She cried on board the liner and tried to wave good-bye
Five weeks of remembering, those names we couldn't say
Staring at the South Pacific sky

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

I spend my time with schemers on the phone
But when I dream, I dream alone
I dream alone, I dream alone, I dream alone

As soon as we set foot on the sun-burnt land
The mountains all around us ran with fire
My family knew right then that our best laid plans
Would have to reach a lot higher

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

I spend my time with schemers on the phone
But when I dream, I dream alone
I dream alone, I dream alone, I dream alone

Rows of simple houses, kids out on the street
Windows all aglow from the brand new TV sets
Screen door always slamming in that endless summer heat
My father working late to pay his debts

My father working late to pay hid debts
Now my little boy is safe in the comfort of his bed
The monster he invented we both chased into the night
His puzzle lies in pieces by the book that we just read
The story of a man who touched the sky

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

I spend my time with schemers on the phone
But when I dream, I dream alone

When my demons take control
And the rain turns into thunder
Somewhere in my soul

You are the Asylum
In the madness of my day
In a world without much kindness
Somehow I always find the way

Every time I turn around
I can see your shadow
Right there on the ground
And every time I call your name

I can hear a voice that I can't explain
When I find myself in a faceless crowd
I know you're right behind me baby
Every time I turn around

In the struggle for survival
Every day becomes a year
How to keep a cool perspective
Isn't always very clear

I need all the shelter
Your lovin' can provide
Like a bridge across the raging river
Take me to the other side

Every time I turn around
I can see your shadow
Right there on the ground
And every time I call your name

I can hear a voice that I can't explain
When I find myself in a faceless crowd
I know you're right behind me

If an ocean stands between us
And my heart begins to pound

Right there on the ground
And every time I call your name

Is this the way it's meant to be
Stare out my window
I see nothing but the trees
I don't like this feeling
Just me on the border
I just want to feel like home
Lead me to water, show me life
Reach for that something that I can't find
Take hold of my hand, bring me home tonight
Lead me to water
Walk to the daylight
I see the end so far away
Break through tomorrow
It's just a game we all must play
She is so many memories
She was all I ever knew
I just want to feel like home
Lead me to water, show me life
Reach for that something that I can't find
Take hold of my hand, bring me home tonight
Lead me to water
Better lead me to water
Lead me to water, show me life
Reach for that something that I can't find

Little River Band,"Busted doors and broken women hang out in the street
Faces unfamiliar turn to stare and not to greet
And the old cafe door's permanently closed, no more cappuccino brewing
There's a pair of eyes peering through the afterglow
Wondering what the hell I'm doin'
This place used to be my home
This town I used to call my own
Over the years nothin' and no one's grown 
In this place, I used to call my home
The old tree on the hill's still standin'
Where my baby and I used to lay down
She taught me about livin', lovin' and life
My first and only love from this town
And the plain old houses seem like long lost friends
But most have been torn down
I guess they tried to make way for some kinda progress
So hard to find in this town

This town I used to call my own
Over the years nothin' and nobody's grown
In this place, I used to call my home

Well I was lookin' over water
And I was sure I saw you in the light

We got down to the gate and I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right
How to tell you girl
I want to build my world around you 
Tell you that it's true 
I want to make you understand I'm talkin' about a lifetime plan

That's the way it began, we were hand in hand 
Glenn Miller's Band was better than before 
We yelled and screamed for more 
And the Porter tunes (Night and Day) 
Made us dance across the room 
It ended all too soon 
And on the way back home I promised you'd never be alone

Hurry, don't be late, I can hardly wait 
I said to myself when we're old 
We'll go dancing in the dark 
Walking through the park and reminiscing

Friday night, it was late, I was walking you home 
We got down to the gate and I was dreaming of the night

Older times we're missing 
Spending the hours reminiscing

How'd you find yourself without losing you?
Still the same person, why they look at you different?
Ain't your fault they're choosing to
Well it's proof and these shits are blinding
They lie to me when telling me they're excited
I never really understood the concept of fame
Is it you or the people around you that change?
Is it true that after, nothing's the same?

Guess he found it in clubs

This lifestyle's never been fun to her
Trials of the past can't run from her
She's incomplete and her stomach churns
And no one's concerned, nothing's learned
Nothing's worth it all, nothing's learned
Pills are popped when the head is hurting
But more than three if that doesn't work
Now suicide's what them papers say
Nobody's at her grave today
Another young soul just fades away
While another young soul is on its way
Shit, what these lights will do in life
But darkness has never been a friend of mine

I ain't never gonna make you cry

She turns into animals, she disappears

You turn your cheek you get slapped
I take the punches I can't slip
And I give it right back
Even if I win girl, you know it really won't mean too much
What I want baby most of all is the only thing I can't touch

Would you pick up the pieces if I stumble and fall
If my world falls apart could you keep it together
If I can't have you I don't want no one at all


Just because I'm so quiet
Just because I don't cry

Is how to take it inside


There's leather and jewels to soothe me
But it really isn't what I need
There's an aching hurt inside of me
And it's the kind of thing you don't see

Where have you gone desparecido
I hope someone remembers your name
Where have you gone desaparecido
How can they just turn their backs to our shame
Where have you gone desaparecido

There's a dark road no one speaks of
But we must live with the truth
It runs from the Plaza De Mayo
To the Rio Sumpul

Wild horses in a world without end
But what do we do until then

Standing here and staring straight into the lies
They can steal all we have
But never can they steal the hope from our eyes
Baby our heart must survive
How many times must we die

Little Texas,"Friday night at the ball game
Sitting down in the cold rain
Cheering for the wrong team
'Cause we drank too much

Mary Ann was something
We were all just nothings
But we made it with her
And the last, we made up

We were on our way
How could those crazy days be so long ago?
We were flyin' high, best friends for life
Don't know where it all goes
But you wake one day and the only thing left
You can say is so long

Made it through the '90s
Careless youth behind me
Fresh out of college
And bound to conquer the world

Charlie went to Detroit
Bobby had some exploits
And me, I got married
To a sweet brown-eyed girl
And she held my heart
Somehow, it fell apart

So long ago, we were flyin' high, best friends for life
Don't know where it all goes
But you wake one day and the only thing left
You can say is so long
Time sure can slip through your hands
Time doesn't care about your man

Sunday morning, cold rain
Wipin' of the tear stains
Saying goodbye to Charlie
Man, you left us to soon

Later on at Harrys
Gathered 'round the chair legs
Memories untouched
To the life that we knew

We were on our way
How can just yesterday be so long ago?
We were flyin' high, best friends for life
Don't know where it all goes
But you wake one day and the only thing left
You can say, we'll just say, so long, so long

Little Texas,"Let's start with cowboys and campfires, star lights and guitars.
Sleeping underneath that Texas sky.
Keep them doggies movin' on 
From Santa Fe to San Antone. Living in the south until you die.
Move on to Sunday crowds and rodeos, stetson hats and fancy clothes. 
Girls who love to dance all night long. 
Bob Wills, Z.Z.Top and Jerry Jeff and Janis Joplin.
Hear that Lone Star soul in their song.

Then Texas would be Mexico.
Where in the name Sam Houston would we be?

But she's chilly as a Tastee Freeze
Ease it over, son
I'll show you how she runs
Screamin' like a demon

When the quarter mile comes
Crankcase cookin', that's her manifold destiny
Now she might run cold for you

She runs hot for me.
She runs hot for me
She runs hot for me
She runs hot for me

Now she might run cold for you
She runs hot for me
She's got a fire in her veins
That's high octane

When her heart starts pumpin'
Her cylinders are jumpin'
Then I give it to her slow
And she gives me back the low ET's

Burnin' down the line
Ten seconds time
Half an hour later
I can still accelerate her 'till we're out of Hardin County
And in another Galaxy---

Now she might run cold for you

She runs hot for me
She runs hot for me
She runs hot for me
She runs hot for me

Now she might run cold for you
She runs hot for me",She Runs Hot
Little Village,"I'm goin' out and get me some sun 
Gonna collect it baby 
Then we can have a whole lot of fun 
Gonna reflect it baby 
That fossil fuel's got no renewal 
You know it couldn't hold a candle 
There ain't no spark in the dark 
Can touch my solar - Solar sex panel 
 
Got a fire up on top of my head 
I'm a love regenerator 
Why don't you get up off your tanning bed 
I'm an ultra-violet penetrator 
Don't sweat and toil with no heating oil 
'Cause Momma I'm hot to handle 
Gonna turn you up, gonna burn you up 
With my solar - solar sex panel 
 
Got a headache burnin' bad gasoline 
Well, I'm gonna relieve it baby 
My solar powered lovin' burns clean 
And you're gonna receive it baby 
And it's rude if it's crude 
Better try my solar - solar sex panel 
Better try my - come and get my 
Solar sex panel 
I'm gonna turn you up 
I'm gonna burn you up 
Better bet your ass I won't run outta gas",Solar Sex Panel
Little Village,"Maybe you have seen me party
And you think I won't do
But inside you see I'm lonely
And I need someone true
Maybe I look like a spider man
But just say the word and I'll learn to fly
Take another look
At what you see
And you may find
That it's all right
Maybe you have seen me walking
Down some city street
And thought there is someone
I couldn't care for
Maybe I look like a sit down guy
But just say the word
I'll be your everything

Take another look
At what you find
'Cause what you find
May be all right

Take another look
At what you see
'Cause you may find
That it's all right
Maybe I look like I'm nowhere
But I'm right here
And I'm a real gone cat

Take another look
At what you see
'Cause you may find
That it's all right
Take another look
At what you see
'Cause you may find
That it's all right",Take Another Look
