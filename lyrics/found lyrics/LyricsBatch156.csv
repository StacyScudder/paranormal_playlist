Approximate a plan
To sell another t shirt
So how's your head hurt
And what's to understand

In aerospace arena

Guided by Voices,"I go outside and it's cold
I walk downtown and it's cold
I do everything that I'm told
The people I meet, so hooked on defeat
And if it's not one thing, then it's ten
I shouldn't have to be told
So I just keep moving around
'Cause I'm cold

I picked up the pieces that break
And try not to make a mistake
And sometimes I'm sick when I wake
I jump in my car and go to a bar
Because it's so much warmer in there
For my decrepit soul
Then I get back to moving around

All wound up
All broken down

The only thing that hurts
Is knowing it gets worse
As it goes

And some think I'll maybe get fired

You do what you do
Because you're told to
It's something of which I'm really not yet quite sold

And if an innocent minute lives for the light
The time is right

To hold back the night - inside
A single glimpse of purity
In a flickering light
Cheyenne sees right

Cheyenne - A drama not acted out
Cheyenne - In destiny stay gazing
Cheyenne - In witnessing if I'm to miss

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

Pela rua deserta e forrada
de folhas caídas que voam ao léu

no rastro das nuvens pesadas que habitam o céu

vejo a escola, o jardim,
vejo a cara de cada um dos meus companheiros.

I was born with blue eyes - they disappeared
(There’s an angel where he likes to hide
There’s an angel where she likes to hide)

I came out in a street wearing cats’ eyes
And the stream never stopped, 'cause nobody lied
(There’s an angel where he needs to hide
There’s an angel where she needs to hide)

And I’m
Dying for you each day
You were the meaning of true
How did I ever lose you?
Dropped you in the sky
Black is not darker than white
A prison is colder than free
Angel, am I still me?
Tell me true
I lost my name in a war
I should have told you before
Somebody mentioned the score
Well I went running

I saw my lines, fly’s on zebra’s backs
City lust, lime rust water falls and attacks
(Snow fall in heaven, where they like to hide
Snow fall in heaven, where they like to hide)

And now I see why I’ve been thirsty for years
‘Cause they lead us back there with cold lunatic skill
(Snow fall in heaven, so they want to hide
They’re cold in heaven, so they want to love)

And I’m
Dying for you each day
You were the meaning of truth
Everything paired out on you
So I dropped you in the sky
Black is no further than white
A prison is colder than free
Angel, am I still me?
Take me back
I saw such things in my sleep
Creatures that taught me to speak
And sang me a tune
Sang me a tune

Nothing really mattered when you called out my name 
In fact Nothing really mattered at all 
And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away 
But I won't get me down
I'm just thankful to be facing the day 
'Cause days don't get you far when you're gone 

It's 5 o' clock on a Friday morning 
One hundred telephones sit and ring
One of them's from someone who knew you
And I still think of you on cold winter mornings 
Darling they'll still remind me of when we were at school 
When they could never have persuaded me that lives like yours were in the hands of these erroneous fools 
And to those of you who live your lives from one day to the next

You flit like a fly catcher, they can't pin you down
Can't pin you down

In my dream you're playing with buckets of sand
And water was running through both of your hands
And I don't think I ever heard you speaking
'Cause I was too wrapped up in the dream I was dreaming

Oh, they're such pretty things they're so cute
But our dreams are all we really need to grow

I had resigned itself, tonight
So I threw it out a fishing line and said
""Catch your will and then catch mine""

Oh, they're such pretty things, they're so cute

And friends especially, I didn't make them

Sometimes I could cry for miles
Sometimes I could cry for miles
Sometimes I could cry for miles
But I don't

So hush the shadows in the oak tree
Be still, curl you on the moor
My heart has fallen by the wayside
I cannot claim her anymore

So don your duffel coats quite slowly
And this start to reset, adjourn
While on the streets of old Sao Paulo
I watch my baby being burned

Sometimes I could cry for miles
Sometimes I could cry for miles
Sometimes I could cry for miles
But I don't

Sometimes I could cry, die inside
Drop my bags and run for miles
And sometimes I could live my life
But I wont, but I won't

Or get me a lover, get me a lover
Who will leave my head alone

Who will fight me pointless war
Get me an exit, I need an exit
I need a window or a door

Thrown across water, thrown across water
Thrown across water like a stone

Ay, get me a lawyer, get me a lawyer
Who will sue the world for me
Get me a person, get me a person
Get me a person who isn't me

Of my stupid little face

Well, I left myself in a hole, in the ground
Well, I left myself lying in a hole, in the ground

I made friends with the insects, but they cannot fly
I made friends with the insects, but they couldn’t fly
I made friends with the insects, but they couldn’t carry me back to you
Carry me back to you now, carry me back

Why does the sun always seem to be your friend, not mine?
Why does the sun always seem to be your friend, not mine?
Why does the sun always seem to be your friend, not mine?
Why does the sun always seem to be your friend, not mine?
Mine, mine

Guillemots,"I am running out of ammunition
For the Soldiers in my head
They only love me with conditions
That None of you will know until I'm dead

And When I wake without her
It's like a sun without a cloud
Beautifully serene and gentle
And Not something of which I'm proud

I have always said that pointless races
Should never be run at all
They should be kept away and chained up
Never mentioned at all

But I can't see the point in
Walking like I do
I get from A to B  and back again
But all I'm doing is passing time

I loved it I loved, it burnt me so

And you trust someone
None of the world can tell you
That they're lying

Then you lose someone
And the bee gets stung

You wanna see it do is die

Big hug

That's what I want

So let's not pretend
We're the best of friends

That we've been crying

Guillemots,"So the king went riding
On a silver horse
Quit the throne
Gone running

For a bit of sugar
And a bit of salt
He waged a war
About nothing

But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
The king is dying
Come out with me tonight

Take on the world
Take up your act
Take out your violence on the sun

You're a speck of dust
I'm a speck of dust
One day we'll fall on everyone

Can we try laughing
Instead of fighting on the phone?
Dancing on our own
And the King's in the corner saying

Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down

I can't walk
I can't talk
I'll probably find our home
Like a dog chasing a bone

The sky is laughing
The sky is laughing
At me, at me

So when the devil asks you
What went wrong
Just tell the beast
His kids are in the garden

You can find a million
Faults in me
But darling, you can't say
I gave you nothing

It's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Oh, you look so good

Are you coming out tonight?

'Cause we're going out tonight
And we won't be cattle on your farm tonight

Ask yourself why
Come on, ask your man why
'Cause you're ugly and you lie

So bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

Are you coming out tonight?
Well, come out with us tonight
'Cause there's wrong and there is right
And we know which one we are tonight

Ah, don't start crying now, don't go crying now
'Cause the moon is gonna dance for us tonight
Don't go dying now, you're not dying now
And the sky is just not close to us tonight

And as for you, friend, high in your high home
Watching us all falling down like rain
I hope you're happy, feel really holy
'Cause your godliness has taken
Every single thing I loved on earth tonight

You're all I've got, believe me
Stay, don't close your eyes
Nobody really dies
They all just end up in the sky
So far away

Oh where oh where can my baby be 
The Lord took her away from me 
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good 
So I can see my baby when I leave this world 

We were out on a date in my daddy's car 
We hadn't driven very far 
There in the road straight up ahead 
A car was stalled the engine was dead 
I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right 
I'll never forget the sound that night 
The screaming tires the busting glass 
The painful scream that I heard last 

[Chorus] 

When I woke up the rain was pouring down 
There were people standing all around 
Something warm flowing through my eyes 
But somehow I found my baby that night 
I lifted her head she looked at me and said 
Hold me darling just a little while 
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss 
I found the love that I knew i have missed 
Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight 
I lost my love my life that night

Siguen brotando las más bellas flores

La vida pasa de largo
No tienes nada qué decir
Y te alimentas de pasado

Cuando se acaba el amor
Da lo mismo día o noche
Duermes a ráfagas y vas
Ciego, perdido, sin control
Y cuesta abajo

Te obsesiona recordar
Cosas inútiles
Y te apetecería odiar
Caminas solo como un loco
Siempre alerta, sin poder llorar

Y el futuro es como un tren
Que nunca para en la estación
Donde tú estás, tienes un tempano
De hielo, en el sitio del corazón

Cuando se acaba el amor
Hasta lo dulce sabe amargo
Echas de menos el ardor
Mojado de su cuerpo, desnudo

Cuando se acaba el amor
La casa se te cae encima
Buscas culpables
Y te vuelves tan violento
Como fuego y gasolina

Y te imaginas que ella está
Con otro ahora
Mientras tú fumas en el bar
Quieres ponerla contra el muro
Desnudarla y verla volar

Cuando se acaba el amor
Eres igual que un perro hambriento
Que vende el alma si le dan
Migajas de calor
Y un poco de aliento

Les zombies y'en a pas que sur Call of
Des histoires, moi, j'en ai pas plus qu'les autres
Tout se ressemble vas-y tweete ça que mon chat déteste les hommes
J'ai le flow qui baise le soul track
Sans boys band
Waouh! Sors le Gospel de Whoopi Goldberg
Non je délire compère, j'ai le droit de le faire parfois
Je rappe depuis 96, à mes délires, les nouveaux clips à voir
On devient maniables, maniaques, demande à Mo-guiz comment je manie l'art
A manger l'instru, cannibale
L'amour de l'encre, je te raconte pas une vie de freestyle
Y&W comme un fast qui traverse l'Espagne
Y'a rien de bestial, j'suis pas venu pour clasher
Arabe c'est toi, t'as vu de chez toi, t'as reconnu le trajet
Articule ou écoute, si tu ne sais pas chanter
Speede pas avant d'apprendre le mot patienter
C'est un message pour tous, pour tous, pour tous

Défoule-toi, mets des coups
Tu veux briller mais t'es grillé comme le billet de Gainsbourg
Comme le billet de Gainsbourg
Tu veux me descendre pendant que je té-mon
Arrête tes conneries avant que je sois rattrapé par mes vieux démons
Laisse-moi te dire que l'espoir n'existe pas
Qu'on est tous dans la merde parce que les stars méprisent le rap
Et c'est la même du 34 au 92
Ouais on se la met mes semblables ont grave besoin de flouze

N'oublie pas qu'on a kické sur les faces B de la Cliqua
Trop de jaloux font leur speech

N'importe qui s'enflamme et j'vois l'avenir en plus

Hey yo, alcoolique accoutumé à tout brûler, à bout de force
A bout de nerfs, à nous le coffre, ah faut du blé, tape sous le porche
Amalgame, là ça m'gave, passe la niak's, y'a pas l'choix
A l'arrache, ça va d'soit, ahlala, j'casse ma voix
Y'a d'quoi rester bouche bée, bébé ici tout s'paie
Des bénéfices, pas de bénévolat la rue m'a boosté
Nègre fier j'ai fait des centaines de guerres j'ai
Galéré des nuits sur Châtelet au RER B
C'est, illicite comme la C, sans cesser
Dans l'zoo on s'assassine ou on part après l'AVC
Et la vie c'est des décès, et des funérailles
Putes et cailles, mais on s'en remettra
Mon père m'a pas laissé glisser
Des bâtards et des traîtres, j'en ai vu en massant boule-de
Coûte que coûte, moi je m'en bas les couilles que vous soyez soudés
Ou j'te shoote, ou j'te fais les fouilles, y faut pas douter
Coupe le souffle à tous ces bâtards qui sont la pour l'blé
Défense de balancer, détends-toi
Les dé-cons vont bader parce que t'es fait dans l'square
Et quand Dwayne chante c'est cadencé, mes gars sont bluffés
On s'est mis au poker depuis qu'les dés sont jetés
Mais eux veulent me fonce-de, me ramener dans des bad trips
Les yeux purple foncés, j'suis parti pour un casse pipe
Je n'veux pas m'enfoncer, j'suis au phone avec la SPIP
Elle veut me voir pioncer en taule ou prendre un bakchich
Et j'suis zehef, t'as pas vu c'qui m'ont ais-f
La poisse me tend les bras pendant qu'la chance me met des ssef
Tout ça c'est dur, les refré a la bref
J'pense a mon père qu'abat ses taffes j'en dors pas et ça m'fait iech
PG c'est pour qu'on fume du hasch, où tu t'caches ?
Un coup d'schlass j'rentre chez moi avec ton crâne comme un apache
Oh oui on vit la nuit oui, Villeneuve c'est pas Neuilly
Y suffit d'un petit délit pour finir à Fleury
En i sur la bécane tant pis si ça paye pas
Je m'enlise en ville sans calculer ces pédales
En bas du block dans mon joint c'est de l'hi'
Et j'suis pas 'stoc mais j'viens mettre les points sur les i

- Man, I got these cheeseburgers. They some double cheeseburgers
- Nigga, I just ate. I just ate. If you ain't got no money, you just assed out
- Come on, man. Wait, wait, wait man. I'll suck your dick
- The fuck you just said nigger?
- I said I'll suck your dick, man. Come on men, let's get

J'y pense à chaque fois et à chaque fois j'agis
Basta tes gars sont pas stables quand j'rappe de la magie
Arrache ta gueule qu'est-ce que tu fous encore ici?
Un ""nique ta mère"" pour une feuille et voilà ton corps y gît
Mais différents sont les gars, trop souvent y sont sociaux
On veut habiter au chaud et dire tout haut ""on nique l'Etat""
Vas-y dis-moi si t'es cap, dis-moi si t'as une lash-ka
J'ai des lames de rasoir jusque sous ma chapka
Un beat et ça ffé-ta, un spliff et un fé-ca
Que le FN suce ma bite, nique et nique le KKK
Du pilon sous la semelle, arraché toute la semaine
Y m'faut du shit, y m'faut d'la bière posé avec une femelle
Evidemment qu'elles aiment vu les phéromones qu'on sème
Deux meujs de cocaïne, je la vois devenir blême
Et tu m’étonnes que souvent ils ont la haine
On deale, on braque, on vole mais c'est ça les vies qu'on mène men
Au fait la rue a fait des fils
Yonea, Willy, Guizmo t'entend les pneus qui crissent
On est là mais crois-moi on vise le haut
Non on fait pas de cinéma on péra on vise l'euro
Paix à toi et à tes gars y faut pas ramper
Y'a eu des drames, j'me suis mouillé et j'suis rentré trempé
Les tapes, les sous les 'tasses poto ça je l'ai fait
Dans la rue j'te sors mon schlass au micro je croise l'épée
Que dalle sur mon pécule j'suis en manque de cul et d'thunes
Cousin faut des écus nique la CAF et la Sécu'
Plane dans les airs, niaks et pépère
J'suis dans l'pc fumant, un P2 c'est mes frères
Est-ce que la vie est belle? Frérot j'en sais rien
A la prochaine escale elle aura de l'héro sous les reins
J'veux plus m’endetter, en fait j'suis en détresse
Au lieu d'ger-chan bah j'fais qu'm'entetter
J'fais du rap, je vends plus mais j'suis toujours un cas soc'
Donc si t'as une bécane oublie pas d'enlever le U
Et les keufs peuvent me lever, un coup de fil à mon avocat
Vodka, un llet-bi : la peine est levée
Bah ouais que j'suis un fou de tess, bah ouais que j'suis un trouble fête
Bah ouais que je m'en bats les couilles, t'as qu'à demander au W
Quand j'y pense y'a un hic, j'veux des blanches et des bif
Un bolide genre un X et un 6
Et les chtars peuvent me filer d'près pour m'avoir dans leurs filets
Négro j'y vais et je m'arrache avec un YZ
Peuvent me filer d'près pour m'avoir dans leurs filets

J'entends la voix des bobos qui résonne
Genre c'est la sère-mi mec
On s'lavait à cinq avec un chauffe-eau qui déconne
J'peux pas raisonner mes frères ils ont vu la même merde
Longtemps j'ai critiqué mon père et j'ai bu la même bière
On n'est pas pire ou mieux qu'un autre, même les gens pieux ont fait des fautes
Y a qu'devant Dieu qu'on jugera tous les pêchés sur tes épaules
Moi, j'ai servi de cobaye à toutes les marques de tise, fils
J'ai vite compris qu'ça rime avec le mal de vivre, clean
Génération fuck tout, fais péter ton zbar
Quand la rue t'fais des appels, apprend à baisser ton regard
Merde, nous aussi on veut l'Axe qui fait kiffer les meufs
Le Clio trois à treize milles balles et pourquoi pas une télé neuve
J'rap pas la rue, j'rap la vie moi
J'ai vu le tiers monde en France sur le tournage du clip de ""Dis-moi""
La vérité n'a qu'un seul visage
Vieille comme le monde mais tellement belle qu'elle a moins de ride que son miroir
Mec c'est l'anarchie, dans ma 'teille une pharmacie
Une barrette de cannabis et j'apparais comme par magie
J'rap la merde et la panique, trois ballets qu'j'déprave la 'sique
L'attaque est dévastatrice, malade mais j'bédave ma weed
Normal avec mes gars on vise le top
On sera premiers des disques d'or
Dans la son-mai une tire de sport
La vie se corse comme diraient les anciens
À force de tous traîner en chien évidemment les p'tits te mordent
Merde, j'ai cogité là-dessus, obligé ça fume
Pour profiter de la vue faut économiser la thune
Scolarité renvoie les chances qu'on n'a pas saisies
Tous la gueule de l'emploi pour ça qu'on est aux Assedics
Villeneuve-La-Garenne, putain j'y ai laissé des frères
J'en ai des pincements au cœur mais faut qu'j'reste fier
Ça bougouge paga les lougoujaga
Rêve de tougou savoir mais poto tout doux ça va
Faut pas m'casser les couilles en freestyle
J'rap et les foules sentent qui parle
Un petit d'la tess qui veut brasser les sous sans bicrave
Et mes gremlins, ils savent que c'est pas l'issue
Y'a des solutions loin de la street et d'ses salissures
J'kicke et c'est quasi sûr que ma figure
Affichera des sourires si j'quitte mes vieilles habitudes
Ma tour des feuj' ma pillave et mes reggaefton
Brave mais depuis qu'j'ai pris du grade bah ils veulent que j'tombe
Motherfucker, j'traîne en bas du bloque
Tu crois quoi, j'me ferai jamais balance par un mogo
Affranchi des galères, garanti d'être à sec
J'attendris mes aspects et ralentis la zeb
Et c'est lassant d'vivre à sec entre taule et Assedics
J'suis fier de la rage que mon projet a fait vivre
Où sont passés tous mes rêves moi qui n'avait qu'ça en tête
Rejoindre ma villa en jet besoin d'la pillave en fait
Avec ma poisse car elle suit tous les lascars
Du falzar au calbar youpi j'ai mes paplars
Groupies, haine et sales shtars mon gava ça va ça vient
Ouais j'suis gavé des envieux qui papotent pour trois fois rien
J'connais les squats bizarres où ça tape des cuites disons vices bidons,
Weed chichon même quand y a les shtars qui passent
Des délits et des crimes, des récits et des histoires
Qui sont racontées parce qu'y a des teci et des riches qui
Vivent sans la compassion bicrave et sensation
D'être une homme libre quand les flics font des rotations
Ils tournent plus que Stromae oui couz' il faut mailler
Dans nos HLM mec, c'est piquouse et faux-papiers
T'as qu'à demander au déclan qui se font té-cla bêtement
À cause de quelques clopes et des vêtements
Merde, fais-moi fumer sur ton joint d'beuf
Tout va vite on devient deuss, j'ai qu'une bite mais quinze teuchs
Tout gentil sous drogue, j'crois que je suis baisé
À chaque fois que j'ai pêché il y a eu anguille sous roche
Et toutes ces envies nous forcent à faire des trucs illégaux
Oui, les gars illico sur le té-cô j'ai mis les go
Et j'parle pas de p'tites poufs de tass-pé big boule
Et Black B qui fouillent tes sages-mé
Et quand j'écris beat lourd et amné'
Guizou est damné, j'kicke pour des années
C'est pas fini il s'trouve que ça le fait
P'tites bouffes et face B j'm'y retrouve et ça m'plaît
Défoncé mais effronté à démonter des sons
Débloquez des fonds aux p'tits oufs des quartier
Arrêtez les promesses, aucune ne sont tenues
La pudeur est toute nue, à 16 ans arrêtez les grossesses
Ah ouais, j'ai les poches pleines?
C'est pas c'que dit le banquier
10 Ans qu'j'ai mes problèmes de fric et mon envie de chanter
92 Grave gravé dans ma teté ma cave
Et puis ma che-frai macabre avec les reufrés
Ça me fait penser qu'on sort pour danser
Comme s'ils demandaient une rançon
Les majors veulent te faire chanter
""Wesh Guizmo, t'as la vingtaine tu parles comme un vieux!
Dis-nous c'est quoi le bordel""
En fait c'est qu'on est que des pions admirés comme des dieux
Invités à des cocktails
Et ça assombrit ma vision qui est déjà foutue
Coup d'jus un peu comme la tombe et la prison
Fouille pas dans ma vie tu vas trouver beaucoup d'sale
J'ai grandi dans des villes où on est formé aux coups de schlass
On est fort, mais beaucoup clamsent ou finissent handicapés
Marre des porcs et de tout c'drame qui nous donne envie d'braquer
Nike Air à bas prix, sacoche de contrefaçon
Hardcore et drôles de boissons, ma gorge est pleine de poison
Alors dis moi qui va m'stopper?
Non c'est pas ton gang de pute
Maintenant qu'ils ont sucé tout le monde, ils vont s'laisser prendre le uc'
Y a qu'des louveteaux dans l'zoo hash dans le jean
Pas de balles dans le bide que des couteaux dans l'dos
Ouais, ça sent la putain de traîtrise ça fait longtemps qu'j'ai la maîtrise
De leur vice et de leur bêtise demande pas pourquoi j'les méprise
Faut qu'ça marche avant qu'ça me les brise, f'voir le cash enfoiré d'tes fils
Que j'mette les liasses dans mon Lévis, une biatch autour d'mon pénis
On est des banlieusards habitués aux palpations
Les rappeurs, c'est des bimbos, y'a les formes, mais y'a pas l'fond
Et j'peux t'en citer des centaines sans identité mais dans c'game
Y'a une quantité démentielle de p'tits gens friqués, c'est dans le zen
Merde, ils nous parlent de lance-roquette, z'ont jamais vu un neuf
A part pour faire une omelette et la ramener à leur meuf
J'ai que des images de salaud, balance des freestyles de paro
Le pe-ra, c'est comme chez moi donc même en slibard, je baraude
Toujours efficace quand j'arrose, j'suis venu pour tous les plier
Bah ouais, j'm'en branle de votre relève, j'suis avec les piliers
Faut une tisse-mé qui déchire, une sse-lia dans la poche
Un p'tit équipier vif qui fait pas le che-lâ quand ça s'cogne
Et les spliffs défilent dans ma gorge, hystérique sans ma drogue
Mystérieux, j'plisse mes yeux dans ma grotte
On met du temps à faire le tour de tous nos vices
On n'a pas eu d'papa poule, mais sache qu'on fera tout pour nos fils
On a l'mord, on n'est pas venu pour jacter
Mes concurrents sont forts seulement à la course à pied
Avoue qu'ça le fait quand j'la découpe
Aboule la fraîche, j'm'en bats les couilles
Parle sur ma tess et v'là les crouilles viendront danser sur ta dépouille
Et c'est garanti sur facture, attentif
Moi j'suis plus un apprenti, j'suis un affranchi des fractures
La vente libre de came pure, ça rend riche mais pas sûr
En une perquis', tu perds la penderie, les voitures
C'est véridique, j'te préviens, j'ai l'seum!
Et s'il m'annonce un cancer, y'a des chances que j'élimine le médecin
Des silhouettes de North Face se baladent dans le noir
Quand ça caille, sans tracas, ça bavarde dans le bat
Souvent dehors quand la Tour Eiffel s'met à briller
Soudain des rêves de billets nous parlent et nous font vriller
Problème d'identité quand tu sais pas, ton père, c'est qui
T'as l'impression qu'l'enfer c'est toi, qu'le monde entier te persécute
La solution, c'est d'mettre les voiles avant de connaître le Rest In Peace
Il faut pas qu'on enrichisse le 5 étoiles de Belzébuth
Faut pas qu'on flanche non!
Franchement, j'regarde le temps qui passe, et j'me dis qu'on a besoin d'changement
J'agis étrangement, j'voulais pas fauter, j'voulais m'élever
On a saboté ma rampe de lancement
Et on n'est pas flemmard, on a trop donné sans rien recevoir
Enfermé dans des halls où ça schlingue le zbar
Ils disent que Guiz abuse, est indécent
J'kick, j'm'amuse, fils t'as vu, y'a rien d'méchant
Mais j'crache des vérités, ça dérange les uns
Quand ça fait plaisir aux autres, bah ça représente les miens
Ceux qu'on a mis d'côté, qui comptent pour du beurre
Mais qui n'ont jamais chipoté pour travailler plus de 35 heures
C'est pour les p'tits frères déboussolés
J'les vois charbonner tout l'hiver pour aller prendre des coups d'soleil
C'est la crise, logiquement, il faut qu'tu creuses
Le premier billet qu'tu croises, passe dessus mais pas en deuz'
Après la tise, le rap est passé à la base
A commencé à faire la bise et à s'chamailler pour du buzz
À c'qui parait, ça fait du biz
Ça vend d'la beuh et puis des taz
Dans pas longtemps, t'auras des rides
J'espère que t'as coffré du cash

Parce que j'ai niqué mon foie, mon pancréas
Sort ton pocheton, vas-y on s'en fait un
On est beaux, on est jeunes on ne réalise pas que
Ce sera la merde le jour où ils légalisent la beuh
Mais pour l'instant j'm'en fous
J'ai que vingt et une piges
Des joints et du biffs
Au bois d'Vincennes j'vais m'rincer une pipe
Et j'irais boire histoire de noyer mon chagrin
Maman culpabilise pas, t'as bien choyé ton gamin
Mais j'me sens seul et le monde est froid, il est glacial
Alors j'suis d'ceux qui ouvrent leurs gueules et qui font des choix
Alors oui, j'ai choisis d'me guer-dro
Une sale mine, levé tôt, la fatigue, le métro
Des nuits entières à réfléchir dans l'vide
A sentir mon foie se rétrécir dans l'bide
Ouais j'me la cogne, en cachette gentiment
Il s'ra surement trop tard si j'arrête dans 10 ans

Mes adultères et mes millions d'péchés
Et y'a tout ce monde perché, la coke est à la mode
J'vois qu'ma côte est en descente donc j'vais m'droguer à la mort
Parce que si j'arrête dans 10 ans, j'accumulerais les dettes de jeux
Fréquenterais les dièz de geuches et les dits-ban
Fini le Guizmo avec des groupies et des fans
A force de tout pillave j'ai déclenché un truc irrémédiable
J'aurais pris l'melon, lâché ma meuf pour une tass-pé d'passage
Insomniaque, mort-vivant j'oublie ce que ça fait d'pachave
J'ai tourné l'dos à tous mes potes, et je t'explique les choses
La solitude a tellement d'charme dans un fix d'héro
21 ans c'est bien trop tôt pour les feux d'la rampe
On fait semblant d'kiffer nos vies, en vrai on veux qu'ça change

J'me vois tirer sur un cul d'joint
J'me vois voler ma mère, lui mentir
Genre ""Passe moi de l'argent une dernière dose et j'vais m'en sortir""
Si j'arrête dans 10 ans, j'oublierai ce que mon père m'a dit
De ma carrière jusqu'au Verbatim
J'aurais provoqué ma chute une fois tombé dans l'piège
J'apprécierai la neige quand mes potes m'ont proposé la luge
Trop zoner ça tue, et une décennie ça passe trop vite
J'réfléchis, j'ai pas de logique, dépressif et alcoolique
Et j'rédige des tas d'folies
Même si j'ai laissé tomber, j'aurai préféré qu'on dise de moi
""Merde, il s'est fait plomber""
Je sens un mal-être grandissant
Ainsi sera ma fin si j'arrête dans 10 ans

On s'est dit qu'on arrête tout dans 10 ans
La beuh l'alcool et l'shit
On s'retrouvera quand on aura 30 ans
Dans un bar glauque ou dans la street

Hey yo j'ai charbonné la nuit histoire de briller le jour
Dis-toi que j'ai risqué ma vie, quitte à me briser le cou
Victoires et argent facile, j'suis dans un vivier de loups
J'n'ai fais que de grands classiques, j'veux me différencier de vous
Et référencer le flouze, m'ont révérencé, le ouf qui se confesse
Et vous prouve que le contexe me rend youv et son complexe
On étouffe et ça pour plaire, dans un trou et on se complait
Donc à soulever des compets, être saoul ou bien pompet
Et la foule vient en concert, pleine de fougue et de fonds d'bières
Y'a plus d'doutes, de frontières, que mes couilles et des conquêtes
J'suis apaisé par la folie, par le vice, que Dieu me guide
Art de street, passe le frique man, je vis c'que je veux vivre

J'suis dans ma ruche et ça bouge pas

C'est pour Paris et ses banlieues, ma clique et ces envieux
Allez vous faire foutre, par chez moi ça kick et c'est dangereux
Ça deal et c'est tant mieux, faut d'la graille dans l'frigo du bébé
Faut mon blaze dans l'bigot d'une traînée
Un gros tar-pé, des gros seins qui sucent, comme j'aime
Qui fument, comme j'aime, qui fait fumer, comme j'aime
Bah ouais j'kiff la gandja ça m'retient d'vous weet
Et d'vous mettre ça, comme la dernière tasse-pé que j'me suis faite
Entrez l'accusé, j'm'entraîne à cuver, j'encaisse, abusé
J'm'emmerde à lutter, j'm'enferme à rucher
Les mamans craquent quand les fils croquent dans le crack
Glock dans le sac, pis si t'as un bloc : vends-le

Pendant que certains jouent de l'arme, parce que ça plait aux filles

Braquer pour les fonds et s'taper pour des thons
Fumer tue, j'en suis à mon deuxième paquet
Mais voltigeur dans ton appart fait qu'mes bijous deviennent glacés
Ça braque, ça vole, ça deal, ça s'tape, ça mord, ça tire
Quand ils auront vu la faim du monde, y'a pas qu'la mort qu'arrive
Soudain, j'pense aux gosses qu'j'ai pas envie d'faire

Guizmo,"L'encre coule, le sang se répand, les frères vivent en marge, fils
Finissent en cage, leur avenir finit saccagé
Saccager nos bâtiments le soir, c'est ça nos vies
On s'atrophie l'esprit avec le shit et d'autres saloperies
Depuis que la baraka est partie, ça fait des bagarres
A dix contre un, on s'croirait dans un géant paris
Paris ou Marseille, dans le fond c'est la même
On s'éternise à faire du fric car il en faut plus que la veille
Et certains papas ont fait leur valise pour retourner au village
Ou bien ont divorcé, voilà un petit bout de ce qui nous arrive
L'arrivée: chez nous c'est tout ce qu'on vise depuis l'départ
Et vu qu'ici y'a pas les loves constamment on s'nourrit d'espoir
On n'cesse de saliver devant les gosses de riches et autres fortunes
Cadre supérieur, Gianni Versace sur le costume
Costume de flic ou de racaille sont de sortis
Légal ou pas: les deux travaillent donc ce sera morbide?
Morbides sont les allées que l'on fréquente
On a des rêves de monter haut même quand on part pour une descente
Je vois les petits frères s'enliser, certains se cachent
Pour se mettre sous flash ne vivent que pour s'enivrer
S'enivrer, s'empirer encore et encore
Aller flamber devant les gadjis qui veulent des colliers en or
Mais c'est pas la vie ça même si c'est pleins d'aléas
J'pense à ceux qui se sont dit ""J'veux tout plaquer, allez hop""
Aller dégaine de fatigué, on traîne sur l'avenue
Comme des chiens qu'ont pas vu que la fourrière allait les embarquer
Entassés, trop souvent passés des nuits au poste
Et je parle pas de la FM mais de celui qui laisse des bosses
Au RMI on fait des mioches, ceux que la DDASS veut placer
J'en connais plus d'un qui dirait que c'est moche

Et demain c'est loin mais de toute façon on s'en fiche
On veut tout niquer, grimper à la tête de l'affiche
Ouais demain c'est mort mais on s'en fout on est têtus

Mec demain c'est loin alors sur le coup on y pense pas
J'crois qu'il y a des plaies que les hôpitaux ne pansent pas
J'te parle de frères et de sœurs qu'en ont trop vu
J'te parle de pères en détresse qu'en ont trop bu
Et peu importe la boisson quand t'es encloisonné
La moins forte des boissons peut empoisonner
Bah ouais, prisonnier de nos destins pas si roses
Victime du cancer du poumon et de la cirrhose
Et la poisse nous rit au nez, pas d'sou pour réveillonner
Les durs s'en sortent alors les sentiments sont ballonnés
La veille on était en vie, demain on sait pas trop
Et peu importe le physique par chez nous on s'appelle ""gros""
Gros: c'est comme ça qu'on veut le compte en banque
Marre de manger des briques et de voir qu'on est en manque
Sky et pastaga, la maille passe-la moi
Tu connais déjà les ratchatchatcha tchatcha
Voyons c'est pas la fin on peut tout faire
Et tant que nos mères sont en vie, croyez-moi on peut tout perdre
Perdre trop souvent c'est le cas
Faut s'éloigner de tout pour tenir le cap et revenir debout
La recette : on est pas nés avec, on la prend
Autant que la perche ne s'demande pas, on te la tend
Attends, de toute façon on a l'habitude
De mener la vie dure, voir les proches vautrer sur le bitume
Demain c'est loin, de toute façon on en parle plus tard
Malgré les fautes on est passés par le plus dar
Demain c'est loin, demain c'est mort

Et demain c'est loin mais de toute façon on s'en fiche
On veut tout niquer, grimper à la tête de l'affiche

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

‘Cos Baby tell me what does it mean to you 
And I say it's alright, alright 
It's time now to face the truth 
‘Cos baby, maybe, I'm crying over you 

So god give me the strength 
To go through it again 
Cause I, I wanna be her lover 
But the more I know, the more I fear 
I'm like so many others 
And the hardest part is when you lose your heart 
To a second hand emotion 

Now it's easy to see with every breath I breathe 
That I'm crying over you 

CHORUS: 
And I say somehow, someday I'm trying to get through to you 
‘Cos baby, baby, what do I have to lose 
And I say hold on, hold on why can't we see it through 
‘Cos baby, maybe, I'm crying over you 
And I say hold on hold on 
What do I have to lose 
‘Cos baby, tell me why I'm crying over you

You have the power to show that you're not affected
And if you try to maintain your superiority
Then you know that you've broken their credibility

making spirits bright,

The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;

And we, we got upsot.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.",Jingle Bells

From the bottom to starting right back where it started

No many how many times I f*** up

Grow up poor, poorer than most 
No papa to show me the roast
So my animal instinct on me go for the dough 
A young n**** started packing toast for the loaf 
Ride another and another and a sister and a brother 
Even robbed a n**** that 
I thought was undercover for a whole block of butter
Crack and snack on my mamma dope, before my mamma woke 
Watch the dreamin' on me beain' on a higher road
It was downhill from now
It was downtown chills and cold courtroom air
Every year I say I'm fin to change 
But every year still the same, 
Ice cold, water still feel my vein 
I can't leave the game, born in it 
Sworn in it, swerving in it, born for it

I can't leave the game 
No matter who many cops get pull on my wrist 
I can't leave the game 
Never leave the game 

Pay for my broken home, broken alone 
Made the best outta what I had 
Gun, glove and mask 
So deep in the game, I couldn't leave if I try 
Even if I quit, keep scream in quad
The s*** is all I know, this all I ever knew 
Started from the bottom then I roused a love of two
Cars got fancy, b****es did too
Ain't got lover n****, wishin' that was you 
But they don't know the struggle, triple triose and the pain 
They don't see the trouble, just the flose and the fame 
They don't see them n****s pointed fingers for the blame
The bodies, the shadies, the blood, the stains 
I can't leave the game, I'm born in it, sworn in it 
Sworviv' in the forn in it 

Every time I wanna leave, I just can't go away 
These streets keep callin' my name 
Every time I wanna leave, I just can't go away 
I can't never leave da game 

No matter how many time I go to jail
I can't never leave da game
No many how many times I f*** up 
I can't never leave da game 

Money in the power, keep on callin' me 
Plus the p**** and the powder make it hard to sleep
Caally flawin' in my chest make it hard to breath 
And all let's get by and make it hard to leave 
I live for the stage, the mics and the lights 
I'm so tired of cops and gettin' read my rights
With my first solo did the run, my advance 
We spend on the loyal, bail on the gun 
Never givin' the chance, always over look
Never givin' the glance 
So I took it like a cook, like I should
Like I 'pose to 
Now I had it hard sink when I flow to

Somethin' tells me he's been here before
'Cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child
When the thought first came to me
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son
That brought back the devil in me

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
Never change

I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
Still wet behind the ears
I been around this track a couple o' times
But now the dust is startin' to clear
Oh yeah!!!

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down

Guns N' Roses,"Don't damn me
When I speak a piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me

Be it a song or a casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks
Of quiet reservations
Your words once heard
They can place you in a faction
My words may disturb
But at least there's a reaction

Sometimes I want to kill
Sometimes I want to die
Sometimes I want to destroy
Sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I could get even
Sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give
Sometimes I never give a fuck

It's only for a while
I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen
Didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world
I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely
I fell down when I was blind

But don't damn me when I speak
A piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me

How can I ever satisfy you
An how can I ever make you see
That, deep inside we're all somebody
An it don't matter who you want to be
But now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend
For this man can say it happened
'Cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped into your world
I kicked you in the mind
An I'm the only witness
To the nature of my crime

But look at what we've done
To the innocent and young
Whoa listen to who's talking
'Cause we're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes
And dumped into the brain
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts
You tell me who's to blame

I know you don't want to hear me crying
An I know you don't want to hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions
But your delusions are yours an not mine
We take for granted that we know the whole story
We judge a book by it's cover
And read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me
An don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my attentions
Can you find the missing link
Your only validation is in living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I've never pretended
As so many others do intending just to please
If I damned your point of view
Could you turn the other cheek

Don't damn me when I speak a piece a mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
Put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me
Don't damn me
I said don't damn me
I said don't hail me
Ah, don't damn me",Don't Damn Me

You can look but you don't see
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care
What's it with you man, and this garden

Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia
If you're lost no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without

You can find it all inside
No need to wrestle with your pride
No you ain't losin' your mind
You're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself
Or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside
For the garden

I wasn't really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering 'round four days
With a smile upon my face

You better go back out and find her

Just like children hidin' in a closet
Can't tell what's goin' on outside

We'll get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love
Could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody darlin' sometimes
Bites the hand that feeds

When I look around
Everybody always brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can't see
But there ain't no peace to found
But if someone really cared
Well they'd take the time to spare

Young at heart but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart

An what more could you ask from me
How could you say that I never needed you
When you took everything
Said you took everything from me

Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

Still talkin' to myself
And nobody's home

So nobody ever told us baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see

Maybe I'll find another way
Find another day
With all the changing seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time

Got your head out of the clouds
You're back down on the ground

And you don't talk so loud
An you don't walk so proud

Why must it drift away and die

Why drag me down in your misery

And when you stare you don't think I feel it

Got your subtle manipulative devices
Just like you I got my vices
I got a thought that would be nice
I'd like to crush your head tight in my vice...pain!!

Hopin' that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you
Or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give
I bought me an illusion
An I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
And I had to have them all
But oh the taste is never so sweet
As what you'd believe it is -
Well I guess it never is

That pump the blood
To the heart of the biz

You know I never thought
That it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me
But it feels as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world
And in my songs
So now I've closed the door
To keep the cold outside
Seems somehow I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you
Or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive

Sweetness is a virtue
And you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you
But my conscience always tells me no

And bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive

No

Gonna have some fun with my frustrations
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour

Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy for he's a man
Sweetheart don't make me laugh
You's gettin' too big for your pants
And I's think maybe you should
Cut out while you can
You can use your illusion -
Let it take you where it may
We live and learn
And then sometimes it's best to walk away
Me I'm just here hangin' on
It's my only place to stay at least
For now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away

I'm taking time quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy 
So why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts
Can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you 
I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page

Kindness is a treasure 
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown
So I'd say it for a good measure
To all the ones like you I've known
Ya know I'd like to shave your head
And all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me's a two way street
An all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
No

Affection is a blessing
Can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether
But the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah I know it's hard to face
When all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman
And I'm such a stupid man
But love like time's got its own plans

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive

So long ago but I still held on
Through all the emotions that I've had to take
And that's the truth, and here's the worst yet

Wouldn't even matter the things that I say
You've made your mind up and gone anyway
And there's no use now in dragging it on
Should've seen it coming all along

Well it's true, oh, I had
My doubts of you

Gonna call the President
Gonna call myself a private eye
Gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI

Gonna make this a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it baby with your morning news
With a sweet hangover
And the headlines too, now

I bet you think I'm doing this all for my health
I should've looked again then at somebody else
Feelin' like I've done way more than wrong
Feelin' like I'm livin' inside of this song
Feelin' like I'm just too tired to care
Feelin' like I've done more than my share
Could've been the way that I carried on
Like a broken record for so long

And I do
Oh, oh
I'm gonna call the President
I'm gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need myself the FBI

Oh, what shall I do?
If I gave my heart to you
It's such a crime you know it's true

Where would you go if I told you

Should be careful and unafraid

(MC Solaar)
Il était vraisemblable que tous les faux semblants
De la farce humanitaire aboutiraient au néant
C'est une boule à facettes comme dans les discothèques
Ca reflète à la lumière et sans elle, ffft ! du vent.
J'aime les images fortes car je suis comme toi
Le poids des mots et le choc des photos

(Guru)
Hey yo, it's time to get up,
time to change the world for some better, cos I'm fed up
We're gonna expose the wrong that's been going on
There's people dying in the streets still
in every city, lots of kids they beat ill
I live in Brooklyn, got boys all over been
around the world and you know that I know...

Chorus

(MC Solaar)
L'homme qui prend le microphone se nomme Solaar
Maître de la rime urbaine accompagné des comparses et de Gangstarr
A Paris en France comme dans la Rome antique
Imite le maître, malgré le mythe comme Spartacus... (limitait le mec)
Qui millimètre après millimètre check l'intellect à des kilomètres
It's your turn, Guru

(Guru)
Crazy madness, it's all I see out my window
It doesn't matter who's the president, yo
I hate to tell ya, but slavery is still in effect
Haven't you checked, us black folks create for ya I make a bet, if you
don't let the truth out huh
Evil will rule without a doubt And it's...

C'est le monde des affaires, OPA sur la misère
Le réel me nargue, tralalalalère

De l'existance du mieux dans un lieu plus pieux
Alors je prends de l'avance, en prenant du recul
Car prendre du recul c'est prendre de l'élan

(Guru)
I come in peace, but sucka's always trying to front, so
I gotta let 'em know, gotta let 'em know
This ain't no game, bub, cause you could wind up dead

[Guru] 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
(I'm walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

Yo here goes some info on my flow and how I move 
to a def groove, I keep my rep smooth 
On the down-low, I travel with my mind to the street 
Concrete, like the gravel I'm in deep 
So I gotta hit ya from a real perspective 
Cause anyone who's talkin that crap, will surely get his 
I'm not the one to act flashy 
Cause man where I be at, we don't have to be classy 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I'm walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

Check it stupid 
While you're out there, on the main streets frontin 
Your game's week, so I'm huntin you down clown 
Cause you need to learn somethin 
All that bluffin, won't get you nothin but killed 
No mission fulfilled, because there's others who will 
get jealous, hell if they can take clout from you, they'll do it 
So that's what I'm about to do, I'll step to it 
and strip you of your pride (your pride) 
And then I'll stick and I'll rip you up from all sides 
or possibly I'll let you slide, slime 
Cause you'll set your own death in just a matter of time 
Yeah, and I'll be somewhere on the sidelines, y'know 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

So when you're lookin for me, here's where I'll be 
I'll be walkin down the backstreets in your vicinity 
Cause I been out here for a few 
So all that you're doin, ain't really nothin new (nothin new) 
I peeped the way you always perpetrate 
You're so phony, you make me wanna regurgitate 
Since you're ridin so high, you're bound to fall 
while I stand tall, and you don't get no props at all out here 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(It's the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(In your backstreets) 

Down the backstreets, is a mind state 
Cause I don't have to be a pop star to rhyme great 
I've been out here observin things 
So now all fake gangsters and pranksters I'm servin 
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm the king 
Come down the backstreets where it's dark 
I'ma snatch your heart 
So get a handle on life and quit livin so trife 
Or else we're gonna have to run up, and SMACK all the weak 
Comin straight from the backstreets 
And I'm out, ninety-three, it's all me ",Down the Backstreets

I need the cash, I need the cash money
With my rhyme display, I may take all the paper wild
I guess I have the know-how

When you see me in the house you better go
""What's up G? What's up Gang?""
Then give me a pound because I've been down
Dedicated and I've waited for my turn

Hold on tight, so you don't slip or slide

You gotta stand on your tired feet
Where we goin don't worry, you'll be there in a hurry
But you better watch you pockets cause the thieves work quickly
This is a New York transit thing
Don't wear too much gold and hide your diamond rings
And don't smile at anyone
Cause people out here, they like to travel with handguns
You say you like this trip, well are you sure?
You better step lively, and watch the

Coming from Uptown, taking you downtown
Headed for Brooklyn, Brooklyn the planet
Somebody stinks in here - I hope you can stand it!
Homeless people everywhere holdin cups for change
And if you don't have none, they may look at you strange
But this is all part of the scene
And yo check those kids cause they're startin to scheme
 
See them lookin at you up and down?
Oh yeah they can tell, that you're somebody from out of town
Think they won't harm you?  Well they might
And that ain't right, but everyday is like a fight

Any wack MC that steps up, is gettin plastered
Straight against the wall, cause I don't stall
I give em drama and trauma, til they all fall
And for those who don't know, about the city life
It's where we take no pity, and the kiddies are trife
Takin the train is just part of it
The next stop is Brooklyn, you're comin to the heart of it

Check it out, if I could give you the world, you know I'd do it

Mmm the things I feel, they are for real 
I'm past the point of dwellin, on the sex appeal 
Mad chicks sweat me, but I desire your womanness 
Dude sweats you, but I'm the best 
Listen, we could build a future together 
No doll and I would never soup you ever, never 
I'm buggin out, over the thought of you leavin

feelings I have, of you and me, it's like a bond 
A treasure, not to be corny but word 
I wanna give you all the joy that you deserve 
I know we argue, sometimes I start to annoy you 
But we should never ever, try to destroy two 
hearts joined, intertwined with a passion 
Give me a chance love, that's all I'm askin 
and furthermore, you can be sure that I'll do 
every little thing you need, yes it's true 
I'm not desperate, but I'm the one for you

Guru,"Coming with the realness lyrics of life 
Some people need to watch what they say 

[Chorus]
Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

Warning, rappers be like boring 
They're sleeping, it's deep man 
So peep in closely when I'm speaking 
Weaklings, it's obvious you can't like up to 
Your petty pointless words, yet and still you love to 
Run off your jibs, now there come a time for judgement 
Punishment, what if we take away your ornaments 
And strip you down to the raw deal 
Then I'd reveal the evidence 
Cause you don't really represent 

[Chorus]

Listen here 
I'm getting tired of you shooting lip 
You better tighten up 
Or you will really slip up 
And say something that you mean to do 
Turn around and it'll be on you 
To save yourself from your call and blunder 
And bury your ??? like the world it's under 
And like a fool you'll sit and wonder 
What, who do you want to know, wish 
No water, no magic spell 
Can save you from your self made hell 
You've made your bed and you know darn well 
You got a lay it in the ?
And there's no magic potion 
To save you from the wheels you've set in motion 
The stone is cut, the die is cast 
What were you thinking 

[Chorus]

I can't understand it, they should ban it, can it 
Too much weak talk and not enough real hip-hop 
I sense a purpose is filling me 
To display credibility and show responsibility, willingly 
I'll take on any Johnny Dangerous 
Pull his file, for he knows he cannot hang with this 
The illest king, I smack the jokers 
No hocus pocus, a real MC when I kick vocals

What's the question?  
Why are you flexin'?
Here's the answer; choice of weapons

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, The Remainz, kid, why you flexin like a bicep?
Heat on your hip just to get a rep; it ain't worth it 
Just because you pack a biscuit doesn't mean you can't 
Become another statistic; you figure it 
Life's a gamble even for vandalz; I handle mine with minds 
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest 
The fear of layin' in wreck causes the stress 
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when it's best

[Guru] 
Yo, little big man, feelin' your oats because you're strapped? 
Bustin' a cap at another kid who's black? 
It ain't all that when the shots are flyin' back 
You made a choice, and the choice you made was whack 
Kinda tipsy, with the liquid confidence 
Pullin' your pistol when it doesn't make sense 
To be the bigger man you figure 
But in the end, it don't pay when you're livin' by the trigger

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
Yeah, it's the master of the who, what, where, and the why 
But, still, I got a problem with seein' my brothers die 
I've been around and lived past the average age of us 
In every obituary, a full page of us 
The game is money, but what about inner wealth? 
The mental, the spiritual, and physical health 
But still, everyday, the city is a test 
That's why some people feel a gun is the best

[Stikken Moov 2] 
No doubt I pack protection, but every altercation 
Or situation doesn't deserve blastin'; I mastered precisions 
Choice of weapon - should I peel or peel out? 
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts

[Chorus x 2]

[Stikken Moov 2] 
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in 
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam, Stikken Moov swarm 
Ready to bust off, like Ron Jeremy, but I chill, G 
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three

[Guru] 
That's why I wield the steel; yes, my microphone is crazy real 
I'm not the one sellin' out to get the mass appeal 
But jail cells are filled with my peeps 
While the rest are gettin' killed in these ill-ass streets 

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
So, pick your weapon - a mic or a gun 
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns; check it 
Leavin' the spot, I seen some wild kids 
One stepped to me, asked me to freestyle, kid 
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side 
I looked him in the eye, smiled, and walked to my ride 
He was actin' kinda hard on the surface 
I said to myself that it really wasn't worth it

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, you think you're all that, 'cause you pack heat? 
Seein' your own brother play the concrete in defeat 
Tryin' to prove yourself while you put the next man down 
But what goes around, comes back, black; best believe that

[Chorus x 2]

You know what I'm sayin'? 
That's all the real heads all over the world 
That realize that this music is real 
That we keep it real like that 
Peace to all my brothers on the third 
And all the real brothers in hip-hop 
It's like a rap's new generation thing, baby 
Peace to Guru

Guru,"Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Yo, just count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)

Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(I say to thee: well, count your blessings)

I remember when I used to get depressed
Overwhelmed by the stress
Feeling my life was the illest mess
Always dwelling on the stuff that wasn't right
And staring at the four walls in my room all night
Searching for a way to cope
The situation shaky, like I'm walkin' on a tightrope
But now I see it's time to get a handle
And take control of things
So for me - I'm a light a candle
And other people got it worse
I get a lot of love, so I ought give my thanks first

Too many times I couldn't see what really I had

Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had

Too many times I asked: ""Why me?""
And I recall when things weren't goin' how they 'sposed to be
Yeah, I know you dig what I'm relayin'
And now I find myself devoting more time to praying
I ain't saying that I don't do no wrong
I'm saying I ain't trying to sing no more sad songs
I got mad responsibilities
I'm building with my family; my loved ones depend on me
I've got no time for envy nor for hate
My inner power's too strong
To let such evil penetrate
The world around is in chaos
But I'd rather seek the truth to be found
Than to be lost
Experience is always the best teacher
Look at the signs, feel the vibes; I'm tryin' to reach ya
I see how much now that one should be grateful for
And we must help the others who can't find a open door

Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had

Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had

Now as we head into the year two thousand
And more and more people can't even get decent housing
Poor education in the schools
And poor employment structures, so some choose illegal tools
By all means, you know we must survive, but think
The energy we give always comes back to us in time
We must decide to make the proper choices
Or the only thing we'll hear is the cries and the screaming voices

Too many times, too many times

For you: dedicated true

[Guru]
To my moms and my pops: I'm glad you stayed together
I don't know too many people to demonstrate true love better
Nowadays kids don't have anyone
But you were there and determined to make me get plenty done
Yes, to achieve although a lot of times I hurt you
But I'm matured now; I'm showin' you my true virtue
As I deliver to you an oath of never-ending love
Admiration and respect, for there is nothing above
A mother's strength and a father's concern
There was guidance no matter which way I turned
Yo, pops, if I could be half the man you are, I'd be a star
Moms, thanks for pushin' me real far
As I proceed through the tundra and harsh winds
I think, reviewin' what you've instilled within
So I'm takin' time out to let you know
Once a boy, now a man; thanks for helpin' me grow

Goin' out to my peoples for all the times we've spent
Fifty deep up in the party, gettin' crazy, stupid bent
Around the block, puffin' lye, cruisin' in the car
Whatever we was doin', I won't forget it, Baby Pah
When I had no dough, you were there
You hooked me with some ends to show me that you cared
You stood by me through the ups and downs
While the other fakin' clowns tried to start hangin' around
See, you were always genuine
That's why respect is due, and I got you on my mind
A lot of people might not understand the way we click
We're rollin' thick, hittin' harder than a ton of bricks
With all the drama and the phony personas
I'd rather check my man, so we can share some knowledge
If the streets were college, some emcees would flunk out
Sendin' shouts to my peeps, crazy love no doubt

[Chorus]

[Guru]
A true friend, kid, is mad, mad rare
Trustin' others is a risk; a lot of things ain't fair
'Cause where I be at, a lot of strange things happen, Jack
You can know a kid for years, and still, he'll stab you in the back
But that's alright 'cause I'm a good judge of character
And me and my family - we maintain the balance to
Master the challenges of life
Like the chain and the star, we link up to shine mad bright
To all my boys way across the country
Dealin' with the struggle - the good, the bad, and the ugly
Yo, under pressure we're the best
No matter what the circumstance, no matter how much stress
Our force has the power to bring forth change
I'd rather see us succeed than feel shame or go insane
Dedicated to my fam that supported
You shall always, I said always, be applauded

 But let me get to the essence of what I'm sayin here 
 Too many blood red streets with bodies layin there 
 The systematic fanatics are at it again 
 Tryin to kill me and all of us my friend

 Cause nowadays, everybody's a killer 
 And as for me, no other MC is iller 
 but still a thorn scrapes my heart 
 when I see another life that's been torn apart 
 over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence 
 that the money only takes precedence 
 Cause everybody wants power 
 While the innocent are born or die, during every hour 
 I scowl as I look upon evil 
 but I must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people 
 And we will learn to respect our neighbors

The governments don't care; they pass the buck 
I'm growin' tired of the trickery 
And the misery; it's makin me kinda sick, you see 
But now I meditate, so I can get it straight

The beast is stalking us, but there's no stopping us 
As long as we maintain the strength within us 
'Cause we're winners, descendants of the kings 
They try to hinder us from doin' our thing 
So get the money, but spend it wisely

Now, as I peer through the window of gloom, and everyday living 
And all the hardships one faces to make you give in 
I dig more intensely, finding greater strength 
A lot of heads is empty
I've got a greater rank 
Than emcees not aware of situations

Thou shalt not bite
Thou shalt not front

They're in a daze, while dope emcees don't get the front page 
Me - I try to channel my rage
As I travel through the city regularly 
Turning the anger and frustration straight into energy 
Yes, you will remember me as the brother who cared 
To dare to step up, with his soul bared 
But never fearing 'cause I've got instructions 
From Him, to go and fight the corruption, so I'm...

So as my mic illuminates, you can feel the state that I'm in

Comin' back like the resurrection 
In this session, I'm professin', that those who don't 
Hear and understand, never loved me, and so I planned 
To take a stand, as one who is firmly focused 
Plus I'm mad worthy with words

Doing this for you and yours

To the lost souls 
I hope you find your way someday 
That's why I sit, and I pray 
For the lost souls 
I hope you find your way someday 
That's why I sit, and I pray

[Guru]
Sometimes I wonder why 
Some people can't see what's beyond the naked eye 
So therefore I must fortify 
Techniques of communication 
For beyond what is considered to be 
Normal conversation 
So I need some proper 'ticipation 
Am I giving what you need?
Yes, true indeed
As greed grows like weed 
Many bad seeds start to contaminate the crop
I think that needs to stop hops
Brothers are slain over respect and clout
While their mothers are trying to figure out
What's it all about
But when you give up on self, that's when you lost
'Cause you're playing with your life
Like it's a coin toss

No doubt I release a form of speech 
Relative to urban outreach 
Transmitted messages to each true listener 
Rhymes divine but rough 
Like the skin on blisters 
'Cause the truth hurts 
Plus I got no time for runnin' around, chasin' skirts 
So, see, my sound is a corrector 
A profound lecture 
Quality texture 
That's because of what I see 
A lot of emcees are gassed like hellium 
Word up, G
A lot of people in general are straight up no good 
Makes me want to shoot 'em 
Aiyo, maybe I should 
But instead I parlay 
Maintain self control 
And say a prayer for the lost souls

Get up, stand up 
Come on, stand up for your right 
One, two
I go to new heights with my insight 
Whipping my mic tight 
With the height of a scholar 
Equipped with the gift to make crazy dollars 
But that ain't the whole 
See my heart is in it 
That's the only way one could even attempt to win it 
Dj spin it while others critique 
But the science makes 'em weak 
Check the words that I speak 
See, it's ridiculous for us 
Not to discuss 
The real issues 
Like all you phonies 
And why I dis you 
Dismiss you as a lost soul

[Jason Kay of Jamiroquai/Guru]
If you don't watch where you step 
You can become indirect 
And you know that you will lose your soul 
And if you truly want to lose 
Until there's nothing to choose 
Then you know that you will lose your soul 
To the lost soul 
I hope you find your way someday 
So I sit, and I pray 
For the lost soul 
I hope you find your way someday 
Lose it 
You can lose it 
You can lose it 
You can lose your soul

[Bahamadia] 
I'm mystical; don't be deceived by the visual 
Visible preference is pure; patent it back to metaphors 
Greetin' 'em Illa del style wild 
Analyze my memoirs, runnin' on eight, four poetic meter 
Soarin' way beyond 
Iambic pentameter or juvenile flam 
Unsyncopated soul, piercin' earlobes and egos 
My vocals read these thoughts - am I hardcore? 
To the grain

[Guru] 
Lame-game, plain-Jane emcees can't approach these 
I shake chumps like fleas; I hold the keys 
To drive you, guide you, provide you 
With the real joints; ahem, I clear my throat of phlegm 
The architect, selecting the blueprints 
To rid the game of nuisance 
Sucker reducin' with the fusion 
Rhymes solid like cement in my musical solution 
Stackin' concrete flows; look out below 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

Rhymes get all up in your grill like freckles 
Most emcees couldn't see me with bifocal spectacles 
There's no protectin' you; with realness, I'm wreckin' you 
I'm beggin' you - take a look into the cipher 
You're dirt on my windshield, so I'm turnin' on my wipers 
And I can see clearly now 
No other rapper is near me 
And all you perpetrators shall fear me now

[Bahamadia] 
Never flip folklores, only realness 
Coincide with the rhythm like I did with Total Wreck 
Respect the architect in this division 
Rhymes written to be hittin' like anti-proton collisions 
Rap newest edition, bringin' the feminine in renditions 
In rare form, defined as optimal for my pedigrees 
In skill three like three-sixty degrees as in well-rounded 
Leavin' the competition dumb-founded 
For when I catch wreck, I astound 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

Floor to ceiling, constantly building 
With power to construct towers of rap cream, kid; what? 
Dreamin' you're lyrical, physical, mystical? 
Your concept's mediocre, plus you're way too typical withcha 
Corny delivery and crazy, whack voice 
Mad corny image; that's why I give you jitters 
It figures I'd have to dust you off the scene 
Like a wiseguy, with my New York lean

[Bahamadia] 
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate 
From state to state, universal, be the orals that I create 
Top notch and on lock like Sentry; opponents could never tempt me 
Samplin' my style like an Akai S-950, and still can't get with me 
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic 
Conductin' phonics like the Philharmonics 
I make in measured melody; kids praise me like the crucifix 
So place Bahamad' amongst your top ten of emcees 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

Devoted to my music, tryin' hard not to look back 
But on occasion I can see your face 
The memories, they got me driftin' a little taste 
But now you're doin' your thing; I'm takin' care of mine 
And so we're movin' on, leavin' the past behind 
I guess relationships - they ain't for me 
That's why I had to set you free 
I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame 
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain 
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh 
Then I realize.. it's something in the past 
Haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame 
We had the joys and pain, sunshine and rain 
Now you got your man, I got my staff, and we laugh 
Then I realize it's something in the past 
My personality is magnanimous 
That's why the ladies always cause a fuss 
It's in the past - what we had 
Aiyyo, respect to your moms, and peace to your dad 
I'm glad that we've been through this 
Because you know what?  I've noticed 
A lot about myself; see, I want to gain wealth 
They say that chasin' women is bad for your health 
I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame 
We have the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain 
Now you got your man, I got my staff, and we laugh 
Then I realize it's something in the past 
Haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame 
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain

 And give the real heads jewels that they needin' (droppin' jewels) 
 I go to Italy and also to France 
 With the chance to enhance the dance (c'mon) 
 I tore up mad spots doin' shows all over

Some people need to watch what they say 

[Chorus]
Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

Warning, rappers be like boring 
They're sleeping, it's deep man 
So peep in closely when I'm speaking 
Weaklings, it's obvious you can't like up to 
Your petty pointless words, yet and still you love to 
Run off your jibs, now there come a time for judgement 
Punishment, what if we take away your ornaments 
And strip you down to the raw deal 
Then I'd reveal the evidence 
Cause you don't really represent 

[Chorus]

Listen here 
I'm getting tired of you shooting lip 
You better tighten up 
Or you will really slip up 
And say something that you mean to do 
Turn around and it'll be on you 
To save yourself from your call and blunder 
And bury your ??? like the world it's under 
And like a fool you'll sit and wonder 
What, who do you want to know, wish 
No water, no magic spell 
Can save you from your self made hell 
You've made your bed and you know darn well 
You got a lay it in the ?
And there's no magic potion 
To save you from the wheels you've set in motion 
The stone is cut, the die is cast 
What were you thinking

I can't understand it, they should ban it, can it 
Too much weak talk and not enough real hip-hop 
I sense a purpose is filling me 
To display credibility and show responsibility, willingly

Pull his file, for he knows he cannot hang with this

I told her I'd call her back later and she still got mad
That was all I said, word up

Why she buggin if I promised that I'd call her back
Of course I'm honest plus I'm keepin things all intact
I be stressed out baby, sometimes on my grind
And on my mind, is a paperchase with minimal time

She should know how it goes - I'm, still into her
I got feelings for her, I been caring for her
But really though; I mean she ought to know the deally-yo
Especially if I'm in a meeting or out shooting a video

I love her yo, but I'm just doin my job
Ain't no need for confusion what I'm doin is hard
I'm the type of man, with a serious type of plan
I'm calmer no drama, no need for gettin hyper

And upset with me, because I'm busy a lot
And if I could you know I would, bring her with me a lot
Ain't nuttin wrong word is bond, it's all in her head

Still she gotta keep it real, either build or destroy

Without a doubt, if she needs, I'ma be right there

This world is crazy, she's supposed to help me stay sane
Supposed to help with the pain, supposed to help me maintain
And quote this, I'm focused on the dreams we share
I got her all up in my mix, so it means I care

This job of mine goes on and on, twenty-four hours a day
And with trust we can win, in a powerful way
When I get home, I'm gonna love her down
I'll be like Teddy, get some hot oils, and rub her down

I know she's bored, feels ignored, all by herself alone
And she hates it, when I turn off my cell phone
But it's alright don't want to fight, it's all in her head

You see the knowledge that I'm kickin' is for you
And there is nothin' that another can do
Try to stop me but I make it through
Recruitin' angels as a warrior I'm true

People need people, it's true
True pride will sustain
In order to do what I do I can let you live
With me inside my brain

[Chorus]

[Guru]
I've been tellin' you, that there's war out here
And I've been tellin' you, that there's more out here
So stop limitin' your thoughts
Stop reconstructin' your plots

It's more than luck it's an art
No more, duckin' from NARC's
Haters stay at a distance, haters keep away from my fam
Haters stay in my business, haters still playin' this jam

Mad Wisdoms, reflect the light of this man
Some jealous rappers, tried to pick a fight with this man
But despite all the nonsense, and false pretense I bomb this
Peace to those I get along with, my real nigga I'm strong with

And never get me twisted with no wack shit
And all that foolishness you was kickin', hey
I know you want to take it back kid

Yeah, c'mon y'all uh, lift your fist
Uhh, yeah, lift your fist c'mon
(Uhh)

[Chorus: Black Thought]
To all my people, just lift your fist
Seem like it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist; we get it down like this
To all my people, ball up your first
Seem like it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist

[Black Thought]
Yo, c'mon
We livin life close to the edge, don't push
But this ain't eighty-three and it's not the Cold Crush
It's kids on the street strapped, huffin that kush(?)
They eyein the next cat, livin all plush
I guess frustration make a brother do what he must
What's the combination that can make a human erupt
Team leaders gettin mutinied up, who couldn't read
the signs, thinkin the day and times is (??)

[Guru]
Indeed, we blast, refuse to kiss ass
Quick fast, ready to mash cause of a bugged out past
Swallow the pain, follow the mental terrain
It takes a hell of a man, nowadays to maintain
Garments bloodstained, face bruised and battered
Our eyes reflect the agony, of dreams that were shattered
And they love it, when we wild out and kill our own
but the greater responsibility, yes, is still our own
 

[Chorus]

[Guru]
Uhh, worldwide famine, ghetto people demand
that somebody do somethin soon, and let's examine
the facts, behind the violent attacks
Behind the daily gunplay the cocaine and the crack
Thug season - what's the reason for the treason?
Everybody's gotta eat, some gotta resort to thievin
Take money money make money money money..

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Yo - from the time they eyes open til the clock strike death
Brothers is stressed, walkin 'round holdin they chest
They got the government surveyin they steps and can't breathe
They dynamitin them projects to smithereens
Money comin but them days too few and far between
You tryin to taste just what the world's offering, ya'mean?
I seen enough to make a grown man scream
Brothers thirsty and hongry to get that thing

[Guru]
Too many tears of pain, too many years of struggle
Too many drops of blood, too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available, too few schools equipped
Too few role models; just gangsters and pimps
Will you succumb, will your heart grow numb
or will you save the world, and use your mind like a gun?
I'm the one - I turn a stick-up kid to a soldier
Me and The Roots, word up, we takin over

Guru,"When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
You can see a lot of things if you look deep enough
It's all around

[Guru]
The city skyline, in the nighttime, be the right time, to ball
out
(Yeah) Who's the real pimp, gangster hustler, you call out
Is it him, is it him or is it, Dukes over there?
Real recognizes real, so yo, no one cares
The chief executive mack, in so deep you can't imagine
I've seen the beatdowns, the gunfights, plus the paddywagon
See daddy with his pants saggin, pushin whips that's too fly
Switchin up to a suit and tie, ladies say he's too cute to lie
(Forget about it) And none of my girls, wanna, talk to you
Plus, none of my boys, gotta, talk to you
Cause when you see me, they'll be somewhere in the cut
And you can't be me, so nip that weak talk in the butt
The party's crowded, and everyone, is showin love
Whassup, what's the deal, how's things holdin up?
(Whassup young blood?) 
The smooth dude, that moves through, with the utmost precision
Truly a wiseguy, seein life with my night vision

See that young blood, comin down the street
Don't be hypnotized by the stride of his feet..
Pickpockets.. streetwalkers.. number runners.. hustlers
 

[Guru]
Lots of ladies, wanna, check me out
And lots of haters, wanna, X me out
I got more style than Gucci, Louis or Prada
Drop more jewels on you, than your uncle or father
Once this envious kid, was temptin me kid
to stoop down to his level and cold empty his wig
He was mad cause his girl wanted up in my world (hahahaha)
I looked the other way, and she was still, stuck in my world
Aiyyo; baby wants to run with me, come with me, have fun with me
I be the man when I'm dipped, or in a t-shirt, and dungarees
I overheard her man, that was screamin in her ear
while I nodded to my peeps, who was schemin in the rear
If he's gon' flip, he's gonna, find out quick
That I stroll with a click, and we roll mad thick
He shook my hand and laughed it off, that was his best decision
We keep it tight aight?  Hangin out, with that night vision

[Isaac Hayes]
I bust into this night club
I can see you perpetraters
Passin out your BID'ness cards
Wearin your knockoff gators
Pimps.. heartbreakers.. dumb-ass Johns..
You got to make a decision, to go witcha instincts

Guru,"Aight, aight, don't be yellin yo
Calm down man, can we talk like civilised people?
I can't take this no more

[Craig David]
I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more

[Guru]
I'm out the door, I can't take it no more
Things have really changed, it's not like before
I mean the vibes between us nowadays are quite shaky
And lately, I ain't been feelin you baby
Somehow you left my interest wander
And now I'm fond of someone else who's diggin me for me 
It's what I longed for
About our current arrangement I ain't sure
Cuz I don't think I love you no more
And yo I had a major effect on you I know
But sure you be showin disrespect to me, so I gotta go
You never gonna see it how I do
And I don't like your attitude and I don't like being lied to
I'm not a door you can't push my buttons
We tried to make it work still we've come up with nothing
So now my patience is thin, the fighting is a bore
And I don't think I love you no more

[Craig David]
I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more

Girlfriend I'm walking to the door
Ain't gonna see me no more
All you seem to do is bore
Me, since I came back off tour
See if I can take your ways
I'm walkin away from only bad days
 
I know there is no easy way
But there's nothing you can say
To change my mind, yeah

[Guru]
I wish I didn't feel this way, wish I was kidding
But another girl has stepped on the scene to put her bid in
I never would have looked in another direction
But you got a strange way of showing love and affection
So I told myself that I deserved better
You only came my way because you heard I had cheddar
And now you seem to me to be so immature
And I don't think I love you no more
And plus I know about that stuff you told your crew when we met
I gotta go somewhere so please let me jet
See you forget about my generous ways and my good heart
You never wanna admit you're wrong, but you should start
Let's put our differences away and end this peacefully
We haven't been getting along at all recently
I've been thinking about this since I came home from tour
And I'm sure, I don't love you no more

[Craig David]
Now I gotta explain that I'm loving and feeding you no more
Everything keeps sticking around since I came back off tour
So tell me why do I have to explain myself baby, ey
Cuz girl you gotta admit that there's nothing more for me to say
Ooh yeay

I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more

When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
then she gets plenty more, uhh 

{repeat Chorus One} 
[Guru] 
Uhh 
Watchin her drivin by, in her new whip so fly 
Wish she could sing me a lullaby, to scoop her I've got to try 
In her eyes, there's a flame that burns right through my soul 
Can't pretend to be cool, about to lose my control 
Yeah I know she's got plenty; admirers, she's got many 
Like an exotic fantasy, into a frenzy she sends me 
Wow I have to sit down, and gather my wits now 
I want to caress those hips now, want to kiss those lips now 

[Badu] 
Hello? Hey babyyy 
I know you called and I didn't answer twice 
But baby that's oh-kay it's nice 
for you to call anyway see, okay, see uhh 
Hey babyyy 
You know it's okay if you don't call me 
anymore cause I got a-plenty 
truckload of niggaz like you at my door {*dial tone*} 

[Chorus One] 
[Guru] 
Yup 
And every day is her day, and every year is her year 
Anyone tried to violate, they could straight disappear 
She don't care if you play yourself, tryin to step to her 
The illest of gangsters, I show and respect to her 
Truly glamourous, she ain't impressed and it shows 
She don't like your new clothes, she don't care about your playa pose 
Do you suppose I could hook up and spend time with her? 
She's just how I dreamed - I'll bust my nine for her 

[Chorus Two: Erykah Badu] 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
any damn thang she wants, uhh 

[Guru] 
Uhh 
Surgeon General - I provide vitamins and minerals 
The charge that she's got on me, should be federal 
I was told never put the two before the one son 
but always cultivate your Wisdom, to help you build your kingdom 
I want to be the answer to every question she has 
So when I wish to enter, she'll be lettin me pass 
I know she wants to be with G-O-D eventually, but still 
She got everything; yeah the girl's got plenty 

[Badu] 
Flowers in her bedroom 
Perfume on her neck 
Nectar from a mason jar 
Seven dollar dress; she's 
Super cute, and plenty bad 
Thirty twenty-two thirty-six and a half 
I, hope the dude will realize 
She got the silky(?) (?)sexy bedroom eyes 
Baby baby please don't break yo' neck 
Cause you gon' have a wreck {*tires squeal*} 
Cause when it comes to love I get plenty, degrees one-twenty 
My back slipped out my dress - OOPS! 

[Chorus Three: Erykah Badu] 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty (she gets it all) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (uhh) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (c'mon) 
and she gets plenty more (plenty more) ahh 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (mm, she gets it all) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
and any damn thang I want - right? 

[Guru] 
That's right 
In this game of life it takes a lot to win 
Plenty more baby's what I got to give 

[Badu] 
Yeah yeah baby that's really nice 
But I'm tryin to read my book and you're in my light 

[Guru] 
Uhh - a woman like you could help me reach the top 
If I get a chance to love you, mm, I won't stop 

[Badu] 
Damn! Oh huh, what? Huh, whaaat? 
I didn't hear you I was thinkin bout some stuff 

[Guru] 
Baby you so fine I want to smack myself 
I don't need no support I'm gonna back myself

Hooo baby you so sweet

In massage therapy I got a master degree

Yo fuck the kiddy crap, I did that stupid shit already jack
Many rapper talk about how they come strapped with plenty gats
And how they, were sellin many cracks
I take my belt off and give 'em a hundred-twenty whacks

So many act, so I treat 'em like my sons
And nowadays you got frail niggaz frontin trife with guns
But I'm the chief like Beanie, none of why'all can see me
'Cause my family ties go as deep as (?)

Peace to all the PJ's and all the DJ's

Leavin emcees depressed, tryna find a new plan

One of the first real niggaz, to ever rock a baldie
Slick Daddy; that's what my ladies like to call me
Trained in combat, still smooth in approach
Live from first class, while you snooze in coach

Coppin cruiser boats, so I can rule the coast
Any altercation, our peeps and do a toast
I go from rockin Timberlands, to wearin Gucci boots
Never chasin a silly bitch, even if the groupie's cute

I'm stakin my claim, breakin you lames
I'll choke you out into submission, you ain't takin a bang

Code of the street, and not they have to kneel
Before the bling era, NYC had it locked
Have we forgot *I said*, I'll blow your spot *I said*
I'm from the days of when Big and Pac used to be tight
Known to get loose with a mic, I'm used to the fight

Frente a otra esfumándose

Que la inocencia nos proteja
ahora que todo es más perverso.
Por mi cabeza ya pidieron recompensa
Pero no hay precio por robar tu corazón.

Somos caballos salvajes
Ya desafiamos la Ley,
De trampas se hizo la ley.

Se escuchan los disparos
Preparan la emboscada.
Y en alambrados como pentagramas

En playas de relojes de arena

A la sobre carga del ayer
Miles de voltios de atracción
Debo ser un buen conductor
Uh babe, no soportaba la presión
Fundí mis naves justo antes de la explosión

De que desastre me salve
En buena hora me solté
Y en un segundo me encontré
Uh babe, en tu orbita
Extasiándome

Fue otro vació que llene
Metros medidos con mi pie
Polos opuestos de atracción
Siempre buscando conexión
Uh babe, el espejismo de una sed
Yo nunca aprendo, de las mareas soy rehén

De que desastre me salve
En mala hora te solté
Y en un segundo me encontré

Uh babe, en un furioso mar
Sin saber de ti

Algunas cosas siempre vuelvo a repetir
Es así.",Desastre

Floreciera del maltrato 
Es que siempre, hasta hace un rato 
No sabía florecer 

Y sobró imaginación 
Para hacer la vista a un lado 
Gasté parte de mi vida 
Escapándole al por qué 

Hasta el sol parece frío 
Si te invade la creencia 
Que el amor es en esencia 
Otra forma de prisión 

Si se enfría el corazón 
Se calienta la cabeza 
Todo cruje y en la sangre 
Cenizas queman 

La pasión fue consumada 
Y el amor abrió sus alas 
La pasión fue consumida 
Y el amor
Se animó a volar 

Y pusimos muchas ganas 
Para definir quién gana 
Y nos subimos a un ring 
De la noche a la mañana 

No nos pudimos tocar 
La fricción cómo quemaba 
Es que no había cómo apagar 
El fueguito entre las piernas 

Este dulce colocón 
Pega amargo en la garganta 
Es que el fragor de la lucha 
Deja el alma envenenada 

Si se calla la cabeza 
Se pude oír el corazón 
Los sentimientos más profundos 
Son más suaves 

La pasión fue consumada 
Y el amor abrió sus alas 
La pasión fue consumida 
Y el amor

Gustavo Cordera,"Abrazate a tus deseos que refrescan
Como dos buenos amigos que comparten libertad
Para que de cuando en cuando tu alma presa
Haga un viaje de aventura a la intensa soledad

Detrás de la desconfianza está la vida
Detrás de la mentira el miedo a la verdad
Aunque asuste la idea de perderte
Es más grande la vergüenza de no dejarte volar

Y caen los días y las verdades en picada
Son los anuncios en las arrugas de la piel
Cuanto más quiero aferrarme a la vida
Más la empiezo a perder

Y confío aunque no es lo conveniente
Hoy en día todo el mundo está armado hasta los dientes
El amor se hizo un juego inteligente
Que se usa de disfraz para engañar a la gente

Y no tengo más mensajes para darte
Más que esta sonrisa inmensa, gratitud y devoción
Es que nunca nada pudo apartarte
De esa forma tan valiente de poner el corazón

Y caen los días y las verdades en picada
Son los anuncios en las arrugas de la piel
Cuanto más quiero aferrarme a la vida
Más la empiezo a perder",Confio
Gustavo Cordera,"Vivo por vos, más que por mí
Por un te quiero,
Me la juego a morir

Fui contra un puño
Con mi nariz
Para mi orgullo
Otra cicatriz
Y no lo puedo decir
(Y no lo pude decir)

Agaché mi cabeza y
Me fui con la certeza
De que un hombre puede
Morir por amor

Y te queda sonando
Un malambo en el mate
Si alguien te patea
Si alguien te patea

Uoh

Sin talismán
Voy a un mar sin fin
Y a ningún lado
Si no me dices sí
Y no lo puedo decir

Otro camino
Nos queda por seguir
Habrá algo más fuerte
Que podamos sentir
Hoy no lo puedo decir

Gustavo Cordera,"La primer flor en mi jardín
Rayo de luz sobre mi atril
Sonrisas del invierno
En mis cielos internos

Tal vez, será que estás aquí para ayudarme
O descubrirme entero
Besé los poros de tu piel
Lenguas de fuego guaraní

Las voces ancestrales
Se escuchan en mi cuerpo
Quizá viniste a mi para mirarme
En tu sabio espejo

Mensajera del Sol
Das calor al dolor
Y valor a mis miedos
Me atreví a cantar
Lo que me hizo mal
Y no como te quiero

Maternidad morena
Vientre azul en Luna llena
Presagios de guerreros
Bujas y hechiceros
La sangre que dejaste aquí
Riega mi suelo con gotas de cielo

Si quiero un beso de verdad
De esos que no pude comprar
Libre como el viento
Antigüo y siempre nuevo
No tengo mas que dejar ser lo que
Seré desnudo y verdadero

Gustavo Cordera,"La inocencia es delicada y con un buen golpe brutal
Te rompieron el espejo y te mirás en la pared de atrás

Hoy tu máquina a vapor ya no quiere más marchar
No hay combustión anímica para seguir el viaje

Siempre hay una explicación para cualquier crueldad
Aunque a veces se te olvide cuando se viene la noche
No hay cuentos novedosos que te puedan rescatar
De los fantasmas obstinados que hoy vienen a tu casa
Se ve en tu mirada que llegaste a la vida

No hay monstruos invencibles
Que no te dejen crecer
Lo que es no puede dejar de ser

Gustavo Cordera,"Te creíste en ese rol de sanador
Un consuelo, y que fue caído del cielo
Una guía protectora, salvadora, creadora
Dar señales que mejoran

Y quisiste retener a un pirata lastimado
Que no asume que su tiempo ya ha pasado
Ser para los demás te deja mal
Tan cumplidora, que a sí misma se abandona

Tan cerca, cerca, muy cerca, cerca

Hoy se ciega los ojos
Busca una explicación
A tanta emoción
Cuánta emoción

Y te hundís en tu cabeza
Que es la madeja de un ovillo
Tu corazón se hizo un anillo
Que a nadie pudo enlazar

Prometer hace tan mal como cumplir
Es mejor traicionar que dejarse morir

Volatil la segura permanencia
Volatil este presente que ya es recuerdo
Volátil la cercanía, la union

Volatil el cordon de la confianza
Se nos quiebran las alas
Por miedo al amor
Volatil la cancion de la esperanza
El cielo de la tierra se desconecto
Fue debil el reino de la alegria
Inoscencia de ayer
Verdad de hoy

Volatil la abundancia
Fragil la dicha
Como la influencia de la luna
En su maximo explendor
El corazon nos muestra
Su placida dulsura
Qu es volatil como nuestro amor
Y volatil como nuestras madrugadas
Los besos que ya no son nada
La certeza es un trago duro
El silencio muestra el lado oscuro
Aunque hay cielo detras de el nuvarron
Cargado de una fuerza sagrada
Es volatil la conciencia
Y volatil nuestra existencia
Volatil como el equilibrio
Que se hace fragil cuando estoy con vos
Y sin vos

mejor que yo...

Ojala nos viera el sol aliento con aliento

no cambiaria nada esta vez
valio la pena abrir de par en par las puertas

Que tienes mas peligro astado 
En tu al trago me has matado

Cerca del mar enbarcan a eternidad

Que nunca habra nada que nos separe

And if you can forgive, love can truly live 
And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive, love can truly live

Struggling to content ourselves with what we think best 
That what makes happy of which we seem never full 
Is actually more than plenty for it is already possessed

But there will come a time
When you will ask me
And I will join you then

And if you're standing there
With me
I'll swear it's a lie, and I'll still believe it

'Cause I came
And I spoke
And you ran
Didn't even wait to hear the words
Or see the look in my eyes
'Cause I bled
And you watched
And I cried myself to sleep
Came to wipe my tears away but you
Couldn't look in my eyes again

Because of the love for me
Because of the love for me
Because of the love for me

Blindly falling faster 
How easy 
Know the place I'm leaving 
And the rest just is gone 
Oh the adoration 
But how much strength does it take 
For exploration 
For split decision 
Or are you stronger to remain 
I find myself convincing 
Blindly falling faster 
How easy

And the rest is just gone

Ignored all my pleas 
Begging to leave

Fell out of the sky

In a mystic ocean's shell

Is taken like the dead man's urn
And tossed into the sea

Write me a letter
And dot your I's and cross your T's
Nothing was everything to me

Under the monster's claws
And in between his teeth
Was the shadow and a silhouette
Of what I thought I'd be

Scars and stitches always fade

I've got her plastered to my wall.
Just like we're dear old friends
Like she already knows me.
She's as perfect as she seems,
Lifts me right out the mezzanine.
I finally fell in love,
I'd been waiting forever.

Keep my head way down.
Stay out I'll stay in.
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm

Guster,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me

When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Guster,"Here we stand
Like Adam and an Eve
Waterfall
Garden of Eden

Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
The birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them

Since the age of the dinosaurs, 
Cars have run on gasoline.
Where, where have they gone now?
It's nothing but flowers

There was a factory,
Now there are mountains and rivers
You got it, you got it
We caught a rattlesnake,
Now we've got something for dinner
You got it, you got it
This was a shopping mall,
Now it's all covered with flowers
You got it, you got it
If this is paradise,
I wish I had a lawnmower
You got it, you got it

Years ago
I was an angrier man
I pretend
I was a billboard

Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With the beautiful highway

This used to be real estate
Now it's only fields and trees
Where, where is the town now?
It's nothing but flowers

The highway's cars
All sacrificed for agriculture
Guess we thought that we'd start over
But I guess I was wrong

Once there were parking lots,
Now it's a peaceful oasis
You got it, you got it
This was a pizza hut,
Now it's all covered in daisies
You got it, you got it
I miss the ""Honky-Tonks""
Dairy Queens and 7-11s
You got it, you got it
And as these fell apart,
Nobody gave much attention
You got it, you got it

I dream of cherry pies,
Candy bars and chocolate chip cookies
You got it, you got it
We used to microwave,
Now we just eat nuts and berries
You got it, you got it
This was a discount store,
Now it's turned into a cornfield
You got it, you got it
Don't leave me standing here,
I can't get used to this lifestyle",(Nothing But) Flowers

You left them here the day you split
Your bass guitar and shaggs CD
Well they don't mean that much to me right now

These days, I'm changing all my strings

Take this bitter pill
Is it easy to swallow?

Guster,"I know a movie star
I've got her plastered to my wall.
Just like we're dear old friends
Like she already knows me.
She's as perfect as she seems,
Lifts me right out the mezzanine.
I finally fell in love,
I'd been waiting forever.

Four, three, two, one
When out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down.
Stay out I'll stay in.
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound.

Lie back and fast asleep
If you could see what I could see.
Drip drop a lovely dream.

Goddamn you movie star,
Can't you just stay a minute more.
We'd be the best of friends
You could stay here forever.

Four, three, two, one
When out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down.
Stay out I'll stay in.
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound.

She will be sweet on me
Just like a mystery.
It's not so hard to see
If I'm not mistaken.
She comes from far away
Gets closer everyday.
And all that I can say
She's all I want and all that I live for.

Hey, who would want to win the damn thing anyway, right boys?!

Children turn green
The flowers die
All the people are gone except I

I've got no home, only streets to roam, live so alone

My wife left me my kids are dead
All this guilt is in my head
I can't go on living like this
I wish that I was dead, I wish

Give me a gun, I'll kill a nun, just wait and see
Give me a gun, I'll shoot a cop to be on TV

And the beauties
I gotta get gotta gotta get gotta gonna get some pills

I just wanna eat pills, kill the pain

Why the fuck am I trapped like this?

You fuck with me and I'll fuck with you
And I'm pissed so pissed off
Nothing you say can make me stop
Time is short like my fuse
Bet against me a you will lose
No, I won't give up
Only place I have to go is up

Morning came the feelings gone
There's nothing in my head
Push the cover to the floor
Stumble out of bed
Wishing I was somewhere far away

Student from Athens Georgia,
Fred Schneider, who went on to front
The hugely successful B-52's tried
Out for this position

Impromptu jams was hard fought
To match the well structured
Melodies of the classic doors numbers.

If I knock her up

The custom dictates you must smoke
With cancers and carcinogens
I need to find some air that's thin

De dagen schrijden aan mij voorbij
Als een sombere lange rij
Ik doe mijn best om door te gaan
Dus ik sluit achteraan 

Ik kom er heus wel overheen
Als ik mezelf de tijd maar gun
Maar nu ben ik het liefst alleen
Het ijs is nog te dun 

En ik besta wel
Dus ik weet wel
Dat ik rustig verder leef 

Want ik moet wel
En ik wil wel
Als ik jou mijn plekje geef 

Want langzaam voel ik mijn handen weer
De tinteling in mijn vingers weer
En pak ik straks mijn leven op
Als de winter is gestopt 

Ik kom er heus wel overheen
Als ik mezelf de tijd maar gun
Maar nu ben ik het liefst alleen
Het ijs is nog te dun 

Ik kom er heus wel overheen

Guus Meeuwis,"Wat gek! Dit is jullie nieuwe huis
Ik woon hier echt niet meer
Toch kom ik elke keer weer thuis
Als ik voor de deur parkeer 

In dit huis staan heel wat spullen
Die ik van vroeger nog herken
Het is een deel van de familie
Die vertelt waarom ik hier graag ben 

Is het opa’s oude tekening
Of is het papa’s grote stoel
Welnee, het is vooral
Wat ik bij jullie voel

Gelukkig heeft de klok niet stil gestaan
Is de bank opnieuw bekleed
En staan de boeken nu op zolder
Die ik één voor één versleet 

Met mijn dozen vol met speelgoed
Met mijn auto’s en mijn trein
Het blijkt dat al die kleine dingen
Groot en onverslijtbaar zijn

Is het opa’s oude tekening
Of is het papa’s grote stoel
Welnee, het is vooral
Wat ik bij jullie voel

Ik merk als ik binnenkom
En mijn moeder heb gekust
Hoe onstuimig ook de wereld is
Hierbinnen vind ik rust 

Mama vraagt of ik blijf eten
Papa hoe het leven staat
Ik weet dat jullie weten
Hoe het werkelijk met me gaat 

Is het opa’s oude tekening
Of is het papa’s grote stoel
Welnee, het is vooral

Ik zie nog zoveel mooie kansen
En mensen en wensen, wensen heb ik ook in overvloed
En zolang er vrouwen zijn om mee te dansen
Zie ik de morgen met vertrouwen tegemoet 

En ik zal me voor mijn goeie moed niet schamen
Een lach is vaak het laatste wat ons rest
En zolang ik vrienden heb die dat beamen
Sta ik niet toe dat het geweld mijn dag verpest 

Ik zie nog zoveel mooie kansen
En mensen en wensen, wensen heb ik ook in overvloed
En zolang er vrouwen zijn om mee te dansen

Ik zeg niet dat het leven nu zo simpel is
En ik mijn ogen sluit voor het venijn
Alleen dat ik te vaak de vlag en wimpel mis
Omdat het echt de moeite waard kan zijn

Mijn kraag staat omhoog
Het is hier ijskoud
Maar gelukkig wel droog

De dagen zijn kort hier
De nacht begint vroeg
De mensen zijn stug

Als ik naar mijn hotel loop
Na een donkere dag
Dan voel ik mijn huissleutel
Diep in mijn zak

Ik loop hier alleen
In een te stille stad
Ik heb eigenlijk nooit last
Van heimwee gehad
Maar de mensen ze slapen
De wereld gaat dicht
En dan denk ik aan Brabant
Want daar brandt nog licht

Ik mis hier de warmte
Van een dorpscafé
De aanspraak van mensen
Met een zachte G

Ik mis zelfs het zeiken
Op alles om niets
Was men maar op Brabant
Zo trots als een Fries

In het zuiden vol zon
Woon ik samen met jou

Van Brabanders hou

Ik keek naar je hand
Door de kou en het leven verdoofd
We keken en zwegen
Nooit de liefde gekregen
Die ons was beloofd 

De wind in jouw haar
Jouw stem net als toen
Je vroeg me hoe het met me ging

Ook al klinkt er een lied
Wij twee op de schouw en een vuur voor de kou
En het vuur doet haar best, maar echt warm wordt het niet 

We wonen hier net, hier staat ons hemelbed
We slapen er samen, maar dromen apart
Het huis wat we kochten heeft kieren, het tocht er
Maar kil is het pas sinds de scheur in je hart

Niemand zei dat het eenvoudig zou zijn
Niemand heeft beloofd dat het vanzelf zou gaan
Wij zijn bijzonder
En jij bent het waard
Dus ik vecht tot de lucht is geklaard  

Een liefde begonnen, de toekomst verzonnen
De waarheid is harder, maar niet minder mooi
Dus moeten we strijden ons hart laten leiden
Soms mag je rusten, maar opgeven nooit 

Niemand zei dat het eenvoudig zou zijn
Niemand heeft beloofd dat het vanzelf zou gaan
Wij zijn bijzonder
En jij bent het waard
Dus ik vecht tot de lucht is geklaard  

Hard is jouw zwijgen
Je schreeuw om wat aandacht
Ik voel veel te goed dat ik nu iets moet doen
Jij moet me helpen, de wonden te stelpen
Ik twijfel voor twee om iets stoms als een zoen

Verblind door het geluk van alledag

Vanavond gaan wij met zijn tweeën
Terug naar de kamer van toen, dat moeten we doen
Want het lijkt nu al zolang geleden
Dat je mij overwon met die zoen, in de kamer van toen

In elk geval de zon, de wind en wij 

Ik had te lang niet zo naar jou gekeken

Guus Meeuwis,"Verse 1
Passionele nachten in het heetst van de strijd.
Die tedere momenten die iedereen ons benijdt.
We staan nu voor een tweesprong en we weten niet waarheen
Ach zouden we niet beter blind zijn voor de wereld om ons heen.
Chorus
Want ik wil jou schouders om op te huilen.
Jou huis om in te schuilen.
Maar alles wat ik wil lijkt zo ver weg.
Zo ver weg van mij.
Ja alles wat ik wil lijkt zo ver weg.
Verse 2
Zonde van de tijd maar wisten wij toen veel.
We waren net achttien en we hadden nog niet veel gezien.
We deden alles samen nooit kon het echt kapot.
Ja in al onze dromen stak de sleutel op 't slot.
Chorus
Verse 3
Nu zoveel jaren later zoveel meer gebeurd.
Ach we voelen het nog steeds, maar velen hebben 't afgekeurd.
Laat ze nu maar praten, laat ze nu maar doen.
We doen nu wat we voelen, en denken nog veel aan toen.

Tenminste dat had ze gedacht
Maar ik heb in mijn hoofd nog wat zonlicht bewaard

Ik moet me inhouden niet te gaan fluiten
Zo loop ik de zon tegemoet

Vandaag zie ik m'n vrienden van vroeger
Gewoon om te zien of er ergens iets zit
Van die jongens in ons die nergens om vroegen
Die niet wilde weten wat zwart was of wit

Ik heb tranen gelachen onnozel gedaan
En tenslotte tevreden, het licht uitgedaan

Ik word begroet met een klap op m'n schouder
Hoe is het met jou eerst grap eerste glas
Hier in dit licht zijn we nauwelijks ouder
Even een stilte dan lachen we pas

Eén voor één druppelt het binnen
De mannen van toen veranderen nooit
Maar toch is er nog zoveel nieuws te verzinnen
De mannen van toen veranderen nooit

Ik heb tranen gelachen onnozel gedaan
En tenslotte tevreden, het licht uitgedaan

En ik kan hier op dit uur geen taxi meer krijgen
Maar dat maakt me niet uit, de Lente begint

I can't believe that this is happening to us
We made vows to never depart
I turn my head to see if you're hurt
Cause I also believe deep in my heart baby

But fairy tales don't always come true

'Cause I'm saying bye bye (don't go)

My sunny days just ain't the same
Every hour of the day brings me tears (I cry too)
So I guess I have to keep on hoping, wishing, praying, that you are here
And, I'd rather end this self misery
Then to go on living without you
And and I, I ask myself over and over again
Did leaving you make me a fool baby

It may not be your day or the day that you want it to happen

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Tourmente mon appétit
Je tombe soudain au creux d'un sentier
Je défaille en chantant et je meurs à moitié
Et gendarmes, qui passez sur le chemin
Gendarmes, je tends les main
Pitié, j'ai faim, je voudrais manger
Je suis léger, léger

Au poste, d'autres moustaches m'ont dit

C'est vous le chanteur le vagabond?
On va vous enfermer, oui, votre compte est bon""
Non, ficelle tu m'as sauvé de la vie

Car, grâce à toi, j'ai rendu l'esprit
Je me suis pendu cette nuit, et depuis

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

She's the sweetest rose of color
This soldier ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds
They sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your dearest May
And sing of Rosa Lee
But the Yellow Rose of Texas
Is the only girl for me

Oh now I'm going to find her
For my heart is full of woe
And we'll sing the song together
That we sang so long ago
We'll play the banjo gaily
And we'll sing the song of yore
And the Yellow Rose of Texas
Shall be mine for ever more

Where the Rio Grande is flowing
And the starry skies are bright
She walks along the river
In the quiet summer night
She thinks if I remember
When we parted long ago
I promised to come back again
And never leave her so

There's a yellow rose of Texas
That I am going to see
No other fellow knows her
No other, only me
She cried so when I left her
It like to broke my heart
And if I ever find her
We never more will part

And on the side he'd beg
So he mopped up

Well, I told ol' Billy shouldn't do it
And ol' Bill said that he knew it
So he started beggin' with a bucket
Instead of a cup

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
Now ol' Bill fluffed his dove
When he wrote a tuxedo to the country club
He's in the jailhouse now

Now Bill had a gal named Sadie
And she said have you seen Billy lately
No I don't believe that he's about

But ol' Sadie went down to the jail
It was just to pay his bail
Then she whispered
Sheriff please don't let him out

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
It was while ol' Bill's away
Sadie's with the sheriff everyday
He's in the jailhouse now

Oh, you remember the last election, yeah
The prohibitionists was in action
Tryin' to elect themselves a president

And Bill Campbell and John Austin
They rode from New Orleans to Boston
[Incomprehensible] bottle in every settlement

They're in the jailhouse now
They're in the jailhouse now
Lord they caught them down by the railroad track
Stealin' a train to haul it back
They're in the jailhouse now

Guy Clark,"Cowboys and Indians and trees he could climb
Tomorrow came too fast but he didn't mind
Ah, the distance was short so light it again
It don't take no time to get where I am

But the one paper kid wasn't really so mean
He's just a little bit scared and a little bit green
And he'd heard of a place that was legal to dream
So he sat with his coffee and a blue Texas wind
And wrote on the rock ""the one paper kid, he's rollin' again""

The driver was drunk or he just didn't see
The future was there: it'll happen to me
And all the time that he wasted was his once again
It never takes too long to go where you've been

There's broken hearts scattered all over the past
And old bad memories tryin' to last
Whiskey and women and growing up fast
Fussin' and lovin' and itchin' like grass

Hell, the one paper kid wasn't really so mean
Just a little bit weird 'cause the times were so lean
Now he's gone to a place where it's legal to dream
No camels, no coffee, no cold morning wind
And it's writ on the rock ""the one paper kid, he's rollin' again
The one paper kid, he's rollin' again",One Paper Kid
Guy Clark,"I wish I had a dime for every bad time
But the bad times always seem to keep the change
You been all alone so you know what I'm sayin'
So when all you can recall is the pain

[Chorus]
Just you wait until tomorrow when you wake up with me
At your side and find I haven't lied about nothin'
I wouldn't trade a tree for the way I feel about you
In the mornin', anyhow I love you

Everyday it gets just a little bit better
And half the gettin' there is knowin' where I been before
I'm sure you understand 'cause I ain't your first man
So when you feel like runnin' for the back door, don't

Guy Clark,"He's a black haired boy of some confusion
And he makes no excuse for the things that he's usin'
He's gentle and wild and a child of the mountain
His words are for singing and his days are for countin'

[Chorus]
And he's looking for a home he's scared to find
Some lady beside him and he's drunk on white wine
Some lady beside him and he's drunk on white wine

He's a devil in the morning and a savior at night
Tomorrow's a case of whatever's right
Lonesome and high are the things that he feels
And the cards that he plays are the ones that he deals

[Chorus]

He's one of the chances you're entitled to take
He's one of the hearts that it's too late to break
I've seen him be sad and never know why
Seen him fall down to laugh, seen him stand up to cry

[Chorus]",Black Haired Boy
Guy Clark,"Now broken hearted people always seem to drink
And tryin' to drown those sorrows ain't as easy as you think
But living with a liar is a hard old way to go
Laughin' just to keep from crying ain't no way to grow old

[Chorus]
So take me to a barroom driver
Set me on a stool
If I can't be her man
I'm damned if I'll be her fool

They say that whiskey ain't the best way, but then I ain't too smart
To think I just found out she was lyin' from the start
So if this is nothing but a bad joke lookin' for a laugh
Hold on to your lampshade darlin' cause I'm looking for a hat

[Chorus]

So get this taxi movin' cause I got no time to lose
There's no time to be choosy, any old bar will do
Cause I'm lookin' to get silly and I'm lookin' to get loose
And if that don't get it done darlin', I'll come looking for you",Broken Hearted People
Guy Clark,"I'd play the Red River Valley
And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' ""

Like desperados waitin' for a train

Guy Clark,"The old gunfighter on the porch
Stared into the sun
And relived the days of living by the gun
When deadly games of pride were played
And living was mistakes not made

And the thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Ah, the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

It's always keep your back to the sun
And he can almost feel the weight of the gun
It's faster than snakes or the blink of an eye
And it's a time for all slow men to die
And his eyes get squinty and his fingers twitch
And he empties the gun at the son of a bitch

And he's hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

Now the burn of a bullet is only a scar
He's back in his chair in front of the bar
And the streets are empty and the blood's all dried
And the dead are dust and the whiskey's inside
So buy him a drink and lend him an ear
He's nobody's fool and the only one here

Who remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Remember the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

He said I stood in that street before it was paved
Learned shoot or be shot before I could shave
And I did it all for the money and fame
Noble was nothing but feeling no shame
And nothing was sacred but stayin' alive
And all that I learned from a Colt 45

Was to curse the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Curse the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

Now he's just an old man that no one believes
Says he's a gunfighter, the last of the breed
And there are ghosts in the street seeking revenge
Calling him out to the lunatic fringe
Now he's out in the traffic checking the sun
And he's killed by a car as he goes for his gun

So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke",The Last Gunfighter Ballad
Guy Clark,"He's a wino, tried and true. 
Done about everything there is to do. 
He worked on freighters, he worked in bars. 
He worked on farms, 'n he worked on cars. 

It was white port, that put that look in his eye 
That grown men get when they need to cry 
And he sat down on the curb to rest 
And his head just fell down on his chest 

He said ""Every single day it gets 
A little bit harder to handle and yet"" 
And he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered 
And the words just rolled off down in the gutter 

Well he was elevator man in a cheap hotel 
In exchange for the rent on a one room cell 
He's old in years beyond his time 
Thanks to the world, and the white Port wine 

So he says ""Son,"" he always called me son 
He said, ""Life for you has just begun"" 
And he told me a story that I heard before 
How he fell in love with a Dallas whore 

Well he could cut through the years to the very night 
When it ended, in a whore house fight 
And she turned his last proposal down 
In favor of being a girl about town 

Now it's been seventeen years right in line 
And he ain't been straight none of the time 
Too many days of fightin' the weather 
And too many nights of not being together 

So he died

Well when they went through his personal affects 
In among the stubs from the welfare checks 
Was a crumblin' picture of a girl in a door 
An address in Dallas, and nothin' more 

The welfare people provided the priest 
A couple from the mission down the street 
Sang Amazing Grace, and no one cried 
'Cept some woman in black, way off to the side 

We all left and she was standing there 
Black veil covering her silver hair 
And 'ol One-Eyed John said her name was Alice 
And she used to be a whore in Dallas 

Let him roar, Lord let him roll 
Bet he's gone to Dallas Rest his soul 
Lord, let him roll, Lord let him roar 
He always said that heaven 
Was just a Dallas whore.",Let Him Roll
Guy Clark,"I found comfort and courage in bottles of whiskey
I swear to you friends that that life is some risky
I have backed away quickly from those who tried to burn me

And stopped up my ears that no one should learn me
But the lady beside me is the one I have chosen
To walk through my life like a coat from the cold

I have flown like a bird from each cage that confined me
And broken every one of the ties that bind me
And I have danced me around some sad ol' situations

And taken my share of them sweet temptations
But the lady beside me is the one I have chosen
To walk through my life like a coat from the cold
To walk through my life like a coat from the cold

Well it's a nickel for the fiddler. It's a nickel for his tune.

And it's a high holiday on the 21st of June.
And it's country music in the park and everybody's ruined.

Well it's fountains full of dogs and kids.
And it's freaky apple pie.
And it's the ones who came to play.
And the ones just passin' by.

And it's coats of many colors.

Lord it's ice cream on a stick.
And it's somethin' you can buy.

Well it's a fiddler from Kentucky,
Who swears he's 83.
And he's fiddled every contest
From here to cripple creek.

And it's plain they half agreed
But it's country music in the park,
As far as they can see.

There stood my father's own father stood huddled 
With the tired and hungry and scared 
Turn of the century pilgrims 
Bound by the dream that they shared 

They were standing in lines just like cattle 
Poked and prodded and shoved 
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom 
Some were were torn from someone they love

Came a young man confused and alone 
Determined and bound for America 
And carryin' everything that he owned

I see that day reflected and I can't hold my feelings inside 
I see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life 
So don't take it for granted say grandfather's Immigrant Eyes 

Now he rocks and stares out the window 
But his eyes are still just as clear 
As the day he sailed through the harbor 
And come ashore on the island of tears 

My grandfather's days are numbered 
But I won' t let his memory die 
'Cause he gave me the gift of this country 
And the look in his Immigrant Eyes",Immigrant Eyes
Guy Clark,"It's like when you're making conversation 
And you're trying not to scream 
And you're trying not to tell 'em 
You don't care what they mean 
And you're really feeling fragile 
And you really can't get home 
And you really feel abandoned 
But you want to be alone 

[Chorus] 
Old Friends they shine like diamonds 
Old Friends you can always call 
Old Friends Lord you can't buy 'em 
You know it's Old Friends after all 

And when the house is empty 
And the lights begin to fade 
And there's nothing to protect you 
Except the window shade 
And it's hard to put your finger 
On the thing that scares you most 
And you can't tell the difference 
Between an angel and a ghost

[Chorus]",Old Friends
Guy Clark,"The sun was hot and the dust rose up like smoke 
So we hid beneath the elm tree and watched the watermelons float 
There in a big 'ol tub of ice 
And we'd split em open with a kitchen knife 
And everybody had a slice it was a watermelon dream 

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' sweeter than a watermelon dream 
'Cept sittin on the front porch eatin' that peach ice cream 
When life is really sweeter than it seems 
That's what you've got to call a watermelon dream 

With sticky hands and and faces we fought the yellow-jackets to a draw 
Then we used the rind for second base and played a little hard ball 
I don't know how much we ate 
But we all got the belly-ache 
And everybody stayed up wat too late 
It was a watermelon dream 

[Chorus]

Then a little after sundown we'd be runnin out of steam 
So we'd light a roman candle and try to hold on tho the dream 
Maybe slip out behind a car 
Take a little tastes from a jar 
Then just lay back and count the stars 
That's called a watermelon dream",Watermelon Dream
Guy Clark,"I'm gonna leave Texarkana

Roll in and out like waves
I got boards to bend I got planks to nail
I got charts to make I got seas to sail 

[Chorus]
I'm gonna build me a boat
With these two hands
It'll be a fair curve
From a noble plan
Let the chips fall where they will
Cause I've got boats to build

The wind can make em sing
Songs of life songs of hope

I know you don't like trouble 
I know you don't like to fight

I couldn't hide it if I tried- that's right

You can't burn me down
They ain't made a job
That I can't work my way around
Sometime I do it for the money 
Sometime for the glamour
Sometime I use my head
Sometime I get a bigger hammer

I worked on the railroad
I worked in the fields
I'm a steeple jack and it's a fact
I drive anything on wheels
I can frame a house drive pilin'
Pour that wet concrete
Take a weldin' rig and build a bridge
And I can do it in my sleep

I'm the jack of all trades
I love every lick I get

There ain't no need to do a job

Guy Clark,"Frankie D. said he got it
Straight from Roger Miller
Life's just like takin' candy
From a gorilla
I started thinkin' man
This ain't so tough
That's about the time
That the monkey showed up
Sometimes I can't find
My heart with both hands
I usually got my head stuck
Down in the sand
I start to feel like
I can't even breathe
What's the little breath of fresh air
Blowin' up my sleeve

Must be my baby hey hey hey
She can make the Mississippi River
Run the other way
Must be my baby just in time
How's she always know when
I'm about to lose my mind

Sometimes it feels like
Everything's a drag
I could not smile my way
Out of a wet paper bag
It gets so dark
That the clock stops tickin'
It's just like night and day
Was playin' chicken
I'm ridin' on the boiler of a long black train
Tryin' to find the brakes
In a drivin' rain
I got smokestack lightning' pourin' out the funnel

Guy Clark,"Picasso said in 1910
I'm gonna paint me a mandolin
Could be cubes it could be curves
I like to mix the paint with nerve
I'm gonna load my brush and fire away
Paint me a hole in the light of day 

[Chorus]
You can play it straight or play it from left field
You got to play it just the way you feel
Come on boys and play it again
Play it on Picasso's mandolin

Well it's colorin' books and drinkin' wine
It's hard to stay between the lines
Ain't no rule if you don't break it
Ain't no chance if you don't take it
He said the damndest thing he ever heard
Was tryin' to learn to sing from a mockingbird 

[Chorus]

Picasso said before he died
There's one more paintin' I'd like to try
The doctor held his breath and then
Picasso nailed a mandolin
He's born in Spain and died in France
He was not scared of baggy pants

Guy Clark,"Now a Ramblin' Jack Elliot said: 
I got these lines in my face 
Tryin' to straighten out the wrinkles in my life 
When I think of all the fools I've been 
It's a wonder that I've sailed this many miles 

To which Larry Mahan replied,
He said, ""The sweet bird of youth 
Was sittin' on my shoulder yesterday 
But she's always changin' partners 
And I always knew she'd up and fly away""

Stayin' up all night 
In the Driskill Hotel

Was cowboy'd all to hell 
The room smelled like bulls 
The words sound like songs 
Now there's a pair to draw to boys 
I would not steer you wrong 

So ol' Ramblin' Jack said: 
He said, ""I recall a time 
I set my soul on fire just for show 
All it ever taught me was 
The more I learn the less I seem to know"" 

Ol' Mahan crawled out from behind a couch and said: 
""Jack, as far as I can see 
Mistakes are only horses in disguise 
Ain't no need to ride 'em over

Guy Clark,"Let us now praise a carpenter and the things that he made
And the way that he lived by the tools of his trade
I can still hear his hammer singing ten penny time
Working by the hour till the day he died

Oh he was tough as a crowbar quick as a chisel
Fair as a plane and true as a level
He was straight as a chalkline and right as a rule
He was square with the world he took good care of his tools

Oh he worked his hands in wood from the crib to the coffin
With a care and a love you don't see too often
He built boats out of wood big boats working in a shipyard
Mansions on the hill and a birdhouse in the backyard
He was tough as a crowbar

He said anything that's worth cuttin' down a tree for
Is worth doin' right don't the Lord love a two by four
Well they asked him how to do some he'd say just like Noah built the ark
You got to hold your mouth right son and never miss your mark
To be tough as a crowbar",The Carpenter

Daddy's gone to Louisville he'll be back tonight
He's gonna get another wagon and a good pair of mules

And we gonna move to Texas we just waitin' on you

Kentucky's alright but there's too many people
Oh just the other day I thought I saw a church steeple
Nope Coleman said daddy don't you worry bout me

I'm gonna stay here in Kentucky till the day I D
I'm gonna drink that sour mash and gonna race that mare
And find that woman with the fox red hair
Now you all been movin' west since the day you got married
Well I'm gettin' off the wagon daddy I'm too old to be carried
Gonna stay here in Kentucky where that bluegrass grow
I'm gonna play it all night down the new cut road

Now Coleman's daddy said what's it all comn' to
Young people these days are just as stubborn as mules
You can't make him go he's too old for that

Tried to sell me four wheels and a trunk.

And I could plainly see, that that's the direction
You're headed in"", and he handed me the keyes.

(I said) No deal you can't sell this stuff to me
No deal, I'm going back to Tennessee

Well, I went to a doctor of the highest order,
He said I couldn't have a drink for a year.
One glass of wine on my birthday
If my birthday wasn't too very near.
Lord, he must have put me in a state of shock
'cause I made it for about two weeks
Then he sent me a bill
That knocked me flat off the wagon
And back down on my feet.
When true love knocked upon my door
She'd just barely turned fifteen
And I was a little bit nervous
If you know just what I mean.
But I've heard somewhere
That true love conquers all
And I figured that was that
Then I started having dreams 'bout
Being chased out of town
Wearing nothing but my cowboy hat.

Well, I come through this life a stumbler, my friends
I expect to die that way
It could be twenty years from now
It could be most any day.
But if there is no whiskey and women, Lord,
Behind them heavenly doors
I'm gonna take my chances down below,
And of that you can be sure.",No Deal

By the time they cut me out of my truck

Tears of sorrow sometimes and all
Some tears betray you just before you know

Now I can't even find my buckle 
Looks like I'm finally through foolin' myself 

[Chorus]
Hang on just as long as you can 
Get up whenever you fall 
Shake it off, Boys, and go 'round again 
Don't be hangin' your life on the wall 

I used to be forever chasin' firetrucks 
I sure could raise me some hell 
I don't know why I like to do that kinda stuff 
I guess I wasn't through foolin' myself 

I used to have a smokin' little fastball 
I sure could show 'em some stuff 
Now I can't even make it on the 
Church team anymore 
I guess I'm finally through foolin' myself 

[Chorus: x2]

Shake it off, Boys, and go 'round again 
Don't be hangin' your life on the wall",Hangin' Your Life on the Wall

Guy Clark,"My father had a Randall knife
My mother gave it to him
When he went off to WWII
To save us all from ruin
If you've ever held a Randall knife
Then you know my father well
If a better blade was ever made
It was probably forged in hell

My father was a good man
A lawyer by his trade
And only once did I ever see
Him misuse the blade
It almost cut his thumb off
When he took it for a tool
The knife was made for darker things
And you could not bend the rules

He let me take it camping once
On a Boy Scout jamboree
And I broke a half an inch off
Trying to stick it in a tree
I hid it from him for a while
But the knife and he were one
He put it in his bottom drawer
Without a hard word one

There it slept and there it stayed
For twenty some odd years
Sort of like Excalibur
Except waiting for a tear

My father died when I was forty
And I couldn't find a way to cry
Not because I didn't love him
Not because he didn't try
I'd cried for every lesser thing
Whiskey, pain and beauty
But he deserved a better tear
And I was not quite ready

So we took his ashed out to sea
And poured `em off the stern
And threw the roses in the wake
Of everything we'd learned
When we got back to the house
They asked me what I wanted
Not the lawbooks not the watch
I need the things he's haunted

My hand burned for the Randall knife
There in the bottom drawer
And I found a tear for my father's life
And all that it stood for",The Randall Knife
Guy Clark,"Love is never gonna be a solid bet 
It's kinda like workin' without a net 
Don't be afraid to let your feelin's out 
That's what lovin' is all about

It's how do you feel, not what do you think 
Stop rattlin' your keys 
Shut up and talk to me 

You know I've known you long enough to know 
There's nothin' you can hide that still don't show 
You ain't foolin' anyone but you 
When you put me through what you put me through 
Come on Honey and tell me the truth 
Gimme chicken fried steak, not a Baby Ruth 
I'm not that hard to please 
Shut up and talk to me 
Shut up and talk to me 

You can talk about the weather 
Till it drives me nits 
You can rattle on about 
Why, who, what 
A little conversation 
Wouldn't hurt that much 
A little somethin' 
With a human touch 

Now, if you're hurtin', Baby, tell me so 
If you need attention let me know 
I'm not the one that you're hidin' from 
It doesn't matter what the ever you done 
You can have your cake and eat it too

Guy Clark,"I got an ol' blue shirt 
And it suits me just fine 
I like the way it feels 
So I wear it all the time 
I got an old guitar 
It won't ever stay in tune 
I like the way it sounds 
In a dark and empty room 

I got an ol' pair of boots 
And they fit just right 
I can work all day 
And I can dance all night 
I got an ol' used car 
And it runs just like a top 
I get the feelin' it ain't 
Ever gonna stop

Stuff that works, stuff that holds up 
The kind of stuff you don' hang on the wall 
Stuff that' real, stuff you feel 
The kind of stuff you reach for when you fall

Who' seen me at my worst 
He can' tell if I'm a blessing 
Or a curse 
But he always shows up 
When the chips are down 
That' the kind of stuff 
I like to be around

I got a woman I love

She's got a playground sense of justice 
She won' take odds

Just to let you know I love you 
Just to let you know I care and I ain't scared 
To have you see how I feel

Just to try and smack you in the heart, 
If I was smart 
I'd give up and go back home

I'm not sayin' I can change it

Just to try and catch you leavin' 
Just to try and catch you unaware 
I don't care 
If that ain't fair, I ain't proud

Just to see if you would open up,

As far as she can see the time has come to pass
As far as she can see the sky is all ablaze

She's takin' it back that she's lost
It's just as clear as the window pane
She'll survive at all cost

On a ray of sunshine she dances out the door
Out into the morning light where the sky is all ablaze

Than bacon & lettuce & home grown tomatoes

All winter without 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' & diggin'
Everytime I go out and pick me a big one

Wha'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things money can't buy
That's true love and homegrown tomatoes

I've been out to eat and that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with eggs eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans pinto or navy
Put 'em on the side put 'em in the middle
Put a home grown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life that I lead
I'd be Johnny tomato seed
Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes

Give me milk and toast

Now there's a couple of cowpokes puttin' up there dukes
Wasn't much to it after both of us puked

And they wrote a couple of tickets and they took a couple of names

It' s salty and hard it it stern as a knife
Where the wind is for blwon' up hurricanes for showin'
The snakes how to swim and the trees how to lean

The shrimpers and their ladies are out in the beer joints
Drinkin' em down for they sail with the dawn
They're bound for the Mexican Bay of Campche
And the deck hands are singin' adios Jole Blon

There's snowbirds in search of that sunshine and night life
And fond of greasin' palms down the beach as they're goin'
This livin' on the edge of the waters of the world
Demands the dignity of whooping cranes and
The likes of Gilbert Roland

In the cars of my youth how I tore through those sand dunes
Cut up my tires on them oyster shell roads
But nothin' is forever say the old men in the shipyards
Turnin' trees into shrimp oats Hell I guess they ought to know

Guy Clark,"Now bein' six years old, I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for

Trains are big and black and smokin' - steam screamin' at the wheels 
Bigger than anything they is, at least that's the way she feels 

Trains are big and black and smokin', louder'n July four, 
But everybody's actin' like this might be somethin' more...

Than just pickin' up the mail, or the soldiers from the war
This is somethin' that even old man Wileman never seen before

And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Somethin' strange is goin' on, and we's all in the way

Well there's fifty or sixty people they're just sittin' on their cars
And the old men left their dominos and they come down from the bars

Everybody's checkin', old Jack Kittrel check his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop 

So we already knowed it, when they finally said 'train time' 
You'd a-thought that Jesus Christ his-self was rollin' down the line

'Cause things got real quiet, momma jerked me back
But not before I'd got the chance to lay a nickel on the track 

[Chorus:]
Look out here she comes, she's comin' 
Look out there she goes, she's gone,
Screamin' straight through Texas 
Like a mad dog cyclone

Big, red, and silver 
She don't make no smoke 
She's a fast-rollin' streamline 
Come to show the folks

[Chorus:]

Lord, she never even stopped

She left fifty or sixty people still sittin' on their cars
And they're wonderin' what it's comin' to 
And how it got this far

And don't let the bluebirds tool ya
And don't let the women do ya

Well, advice is fine if you've got a mind
To listen to the end that's got the time
But the muse'll get ya if you don't look out

Such an easy way to get it to

And don't let the women do ya

Pitched up against the wall at least a thousand times

I was good luck to a soldier back in W.W.II 
He lost me in a poker game the day the war was through 

I got stuck behind the back seat of a '51 Chevrolet

Now it's piggy banks and gum machines and occasional wishing wells 
Or laying on a barroom floor, Indian heads or tails

She's a travelin' Arkansawyer 

Put her fiddle in a box 
Said it's getting awful late 
She's on her way to Little Rock 
And Little Rock can't wait 

So we all stood out in the yard 
Hands all full of watermelon 
Watcher her leave watched her go 
Wishin' I was in that wagon

Guy Clark,"They baptized me one fine day 
Down at the river's edge 
All my sins are washed away 
Like water under the bridge 

I had a little girl and her eyes were blue 
She lived just over the ridge 
Her love ran deep and her love ran true 
Like water under the bridge 

Sailin' away on a paper boat 
As far as I can go 
All the way to New Orleans 
And the Gulf of Mexico 

River run clear river run clean 
River run rough sometime 
River run wild and it run serene 
Just like a friend of mine 

Tie my troubles in a gunnysack 
And throw em' over the edge 
Sailin' away and I won't be back 
Like water under the bridge 

You might be saint you might be sinner 
You might be Billy The Kid 
You might crap out or roll a winner 
It's water under the bridge",Water Under the Bridge
Guy Clark,"I wish I had a dime for every bad time
But the bad times always seem to keep the change
You been all alone so you know what I'm sayin'
So when all you can recall is the pain

[Chorus]
Just you wait until tomorrow when you wake up with me
At your side and find I haven't lied about nothin'
I wouldn't trade a tree for the way I feel about you
In the mornin', anyhow I love you

Everyday it gets just a little bit better
And half the gettin' there is knowin' where I been before
I'm sure you understand 'cause I ain't your first man
So when you feel like runnin' for the back door, don't

Guy Clark,"It was in the town of  Nashville in the year of 75
This Arizona star, she just fell out of the sky
She was shining like a diamond, she had tombstones in her eyes
She liked drinking she liked smoking, she liked dancing in the aisles

She was a primadonna, pre-madonna, hard time southern bell
Man she should have been an actress oh she played the part so well
She might have been a singer, but you really couldn't really tell
She was the Arizona star and she was born to give 'em hell

[Chorus]
When your cool, the sun shines all the time
So she always kept her shades on to keep from going blind
She was cool, She was out there so far
She was nothing less and nothing more than the Arizona Star

She had a girlfriend named George, George carried a sword
And wore purple tights an they hung out every night
Oh I'm talking bout a circus man, I'm talking bout three rings
And there was four or five clowns in a washing machine
Oh she never met a stranger least as far as I can tell
She was the Arizona Star and Jim McGuire he knew her well
She made real an oxymoron, she made mirrors she made smoke
She had a curve ball that wouldn't quit and a girlfriend for a joke

[Chorus]",Arizona Star
Guy Clark,"He said his hip talks to him when it's ready to rain
He's had a little nip and he's feeling no pain
When he gets like this, he feels like talkin
He said he took some shrapnel at the bay of pigs
He lost two fingers on a gulf oil rig
You gotta watch him, or he'll take off walkin
Some folks say he's lost his mind, but he's just running out of time

[Chorus]
He said, this old bag of bones ain't really me
There's a lot more standing here than what you see
He said my back is bending low but my spirits flying free
This old bag of bones ain't really me

He said I live each day like it's my last
Time won't keep, it goes so fast
You better do the best that you can do

He said, life's a tune you whistle in the dark
When you get it right, you get a little spark
And the sun comes up and it all dawns on you

He said, this old bag of bones ain't really me

Guy Clark,"Hammer on both strings for the Em. 
You will have to experiment 
To get the exact position of the chord changes with respect 
To the lyrics but this is close.

In the dark you can sometimes hear your own heartbeat
Or the heart of the one next to you 
And the house settles down after holding itself up all day
Shoulders slump, gives a big sigh
You hear no ones footfall in the hall 

That drip in the kitchen sink keeps marking time
June bug on the window screen can't get in but keeps on trying

One way or another we're all in the dark 

Fireflies and sparks and lightning, stars
Campfires, the moon headlights on cars
The Northern lights, the milky way
You can't see that stuff in the day

The Earth turns it's back on the sun
And the stars come out and the planets start to run around
They call that 'day is done
But really it's just getting started 
Some folks take comfort in that

How dark is it it's too dark for goblins
How dark is it it's so dark you can smell the moon
How dark is it it's so dark the wind gets lost
How dark is it so dark the sky's on fire
How dark is it so dark you can see Fort Worth from here",The Dark

Homeless, get away from here

You'll do anything that you gotta do, when you're homeless.

Betty sings a song that no one hears, as the wind begins to freeze her tears

I'd rather go hungry than eat lonesome stew

Gonna face his doubts

She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be

If I had a nickel I'd find a game
If I won a dollar I'd make it rain
If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied

Legs to walk and thoughts to fly
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die

So tell my baby I said so long
Tell my mother I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own
And tell my friends to mourn me none

I'm chained upon the face of time
Feelin' full of foolish rhyme
There ain't no dark till something shines
I'm bound to leave this dark behind

Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be",Rex's Blues

T'was a bullet bit my leg, right off I got sick

Five was dead by the time we reached that bloody tent

I don't want to hurt no more my leg is turnin' green

Your dancin' days are done, son, it's a wonder you ain't dead
Then he went to work with a carvin' knife sweat fell from his brow
'Bout killed me tryin' to save my life when he cut that lead ball out

Hand me down my walkin' cane I ain't cut out for war

Run right down his apron strings like a river out the door
He handed me a bottle and said, son drink deep as you can
He turned away then he turned right back with a hacksaw in his hand

With the process of the law.

I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,
Did offer him my hand,
He gave a string of horses
So old they could not stand.

And I nearly starved to death, boys,
He did mistreat me so,
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe.

Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw,
Nearly drove me crazy
With the waggin' of his jaw.

And the tellin' of his story,
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe.

Now, I tried three times to quit him,
But he did argue so

And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin'""

Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

Guy Clark,"Well the bus pulled away
In a roaring black cloud
While I stood in the road
And honey I hollered right out loud

Hey darlin' I love you
Hey bus driver whoa
But you can't stop a woman
When she's out of control

[Chorus]
She's crazy for leavin'
I told her so
When the boys at the bus stop
Just said man let her go
She's crazy for leavin'
I told her so
But you can't stop a woman
When she's out of control

So I punched out my truck
On a telephone pole
Now she never looked back
She just said go driver go

Well I know I could have caught her
But I ran out of luck
She was long gone to Lufkin
By the time they cut me out of my truck

[Chorus]

So I kicked and I cussed
That old east Texas road
I throwed rocks at my truck
Which had busted my nose

You add insult to injury
What do you get
You get a bus stop full of honkies
That don't ever forget

[Chorus]",She's Crazy for Leaving
Guy Clark,"Standing at the window her face to the glass
As far as she can see the time has come to pass
As far as she can see the sky is all ablaze
And this looks like the first of better days

She's takin' charge of her life for a change
She's takin' it back that she's lost
It's just as clear as the window pane
She'll survive at all cost

See the wings unfolding that weren't there just before
On a ray of sunshine she dances out the door
Out into the morning light where the sky is all ablaze

Guy Clark,"Ain't nothin' in the world that I like better
Than bacon & lettuce & homegrown tomatoes
Up in the mornin' out in the garden

Get you a ripe one don't get a hard one
Plant 'em in the spring eat 'em in the summer
All winter with out 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' & diggin'
Everytime I go out & pick me a big one

Homegrown tomatoes homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things that money can't buy
That's true love & homegrown tomatoes

You can go out to eat & that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with egss, eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
Put 'em on the site put 'em in the middle
Put a homegrown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life I lead
I'd be Johnny Tomato Seed
'Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes",Homegrown Tomatoes [DVD]
Guy Clark,"My father had a Randall knife
My mother gave it to him
When he went off to WWII
To save us all from ruin
If you've ever held a Randall knife
Then you know my father well
If a better blade was ever made
It was probably forged in hell 

My father was a good man
A lawyer by his trade
And only once did I ever see
Him misuse the blade
It almost cut his thumb off
When he took it for a tool
The knife was made for darker things
And you could not bend the rules

He let me take it camping once
On a Boy Scout jamboree
And I broke a half an inch off
Trying to stick it in a tree
I hid it from him for a while
But the knife and he were one
He put it in his bottom drawer
Without a hard word one

There it slept and there it stayed
For twenty some odd years
Sort of like Excalibur
Except waiting for a tear 

My father died when I was forty
And I couldn't find a way to cry
Not because I didn't love him
Not because he didn't try
I'd cried for every lesser thing
Whiskey, pain and beauty
But he deserved a better tear
And I was not quite ready

So we took his ashed out to sea
And poured 'em off the stern
And threw the roses in the wake
Of everything we'd learned
When we got back to the house
They asked me what I wanted
Not the law books not the watch
I need the things he's haunted

My hand burned for the Randall knife
There in the bottom drawer
And I found a tear for my father's life
And all that it stood for",Randall Knife [DVD]
Guy Clark,"Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But, I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Livin's mostly wastin' time
I waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too long
You're soft as glass
And I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon.

Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
But don't turn none away
Everything is not enough
Nothin' is to much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep is the gettin' there
To live is to fly
Low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes

It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think on all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think to much
On things you leave behind
I may be gone
But it won't be long
I will be a-bringin' back the melody
And the rhythm that I find

We all got holes to fill
Them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
But choice is yours to make
And time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone
To live is to fly
Low and high,
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the tears out of your eyes",To Live Is to Fly [DVD]

Popping oldies, but the whole plane change

They want me to turn around like this is hokie poke
They want to break me down like erv before I choke

And number 20 on the Lakers couldn't hold me y'all
I'm climbing over y'all I'm still scoring

Females fans sayin that I'm there baby daddy WHOA
More attention then Justin and Janet
How I Midwest swing and how St Louis ram it
Deerty ent dammit, got more bread than a sandwich
And my writst got more nuggets than Carmello and Camby
Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the arts
So tours look for me like an important part
Find your talent use your talent get your money
Or don't find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy
But that don't owe me cause I built it from scratch
My next shit is a house with a house in the back
Man I'm been while since middle school
I was that little dude that been round more waist lines than hoola hoops

I've tagged my name on the wall
It's probably time for me to leave

I've dragged trouble through the door
And I've spilled wine on it all

It'll probably bleed through
Maybe I can paint over that
But I can't hide it from you

I've got some ink beneath my skin
A good idea at the time
I won't be doing that again
Not with any arm of mine

And I have stumbled in my time
I left my footprints down the road
And the part of me that shines
Ain't the part of me that's showed

I was sittin' on the fender of someone else's truck
Drinking Old Crow whisky, hot 7-up
Out in the parking lot

You can hear the band a playin right through the wall
Ain't no cover charge, there ain't no last call
Out in the parking lot

Now there's a couple of cowpokes puttin' up there dukes
Wasn't much to it after both of ‘em puked
Out in the parking lot

Now someone called the police and the police finally came
And they wrote ‘em a couple of tickets and they took a couple of names
Out in the parking lot

I love to see the neon dancin' on the gravel
I love to hear the pickup trucks come unraveled
Some have given up, some have given in
Looks like everybody's looking for a friend
Out in the parking lot

Oops there's a couple who could not wait to get home
They're probably in love so let's leave them alone
Out in the parking lot

The band is on the bus, they're all loaded up to leave
But the drummer's got a girlfriend and she's tuggin at his sleeve
Out in the parking lot

Guy Clark,"There's nothin' like cornmeal on a dance-hall floor for dancin' the night away,
Slippin' and slidin', effortlessly glidin' in the arms of my sweet Lillie Mae,
So I shined up my boots and ironed my shirt, and pulled on some new blue jeans.
Oh, I brushed off my hat, slicked back my hair; I'll beat all that she's ever seen.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Doin' the cornmeal waltz.

Way out on Ranch Road 17 there's a dance hall in the live-oak trees,
Yellow lights strung up all around, so all the little kids can see.
Pickups are parked near to the road; the beer is so cold it might freeze.
Stars are all out, the band's in tune, and it smells like a barbecue breeze.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Doin' the cornmeal waltz.

Beat-up old Stetsons, beehive hair, belt buckles bumpin' in time.
There's little girls dancin' on their daddies' toes, spinnin' around on a dime.
Grandma and Grandpa are out on the floor, dancin' like they've lost their minds.
There's old maids and bachelors and sweethearts alike, all movin' in three-quarter time.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Just doin' the cornmeal waltz.",Cornmeal Waltz
Guy Clark,"In the town of Reynosa, there's a beautiful river
That shines in the Mexico sun.
There are boats and they cross from one side to the other,
At dusk when the hot day is done.
From there to Acuña to Del Rio, Texas,
You valley up through San Antone.
With the pesos I've saved up for years then I'll trade
For the chance to send dollars back home.

Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun.
Coyote, qué hiciste cabron?

He steps out of the shadows, he won't look in my eyes
His hand's out to take all I've got.
He says that he's smuggled a thousand good men
And he says that he's never been caught.
So with seventeen other, braceros like cattle
Packed in for that long final ride.
In the semi-truck crossing the border it's dark,
And it's hot as an oven inside.

Coyote, coyote, qué hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun.
Coyote, qué hiciste cabron?

The braceros are asking in whispers,
Why the truck stopped in the heat of the day?
At first sign of trouble, he's left us all there
By the road and he's walking away.

Swallow it down with a shot of pride,

Guy Clark,"I decided to improve my social station
I joined a fraternity organisation
Tucked in my shirt
Signed on the line
Right away they said about to improve my mind
The car I drove
The books I read
The food I ate
The booze I drank
The girls I took out
My breath

Said ""Kid, we don't much like the way you walk
And you gonna have to change the way you talk""
They said ""your dress is kind of sludge
And your attitude is mighty grudge""
Said ""you got to learn to bubble""
""You got to bubble with enthusiasm"" I started bubble
""Most important thing you can't forget
Is learning the entire Greek alphabet""
I never did really understand
That that's gonna make me anymore a man
But I learned it
I can whip through that Son-of-a-beta backwards in five seconds
Then they hit me with some pretty bad news
Concerning the payment of monthly dues
I never did know where that money went
I never was sure it was well spent
But I paid it
I'm no trouble causer and besides I figured that's life
If you want good friends it gonna cost you

Well, finally got to be party time
I got a great big old jug of wine
I went back to the house in about an hour
When the boy's were drinking whiskey sours
Brandy Alexanders
Frozen daquires
Reciting the Greek alphabet to one another

I could see I was gonna have to do my very best
To get myself out of that fraternity mess
I stood right there outside the door
And I chugged that wine like never before
Walked inside and bubbled
All over a couple of their dates

So now everything's back to normal again
But there is still lots of room for improvement my friend
'Cause that fraternity stuff is too much for me
Next time I'm gonna join a sorority

Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
we're headed down into fall


I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
hustled up a little dough
but I got drunk and I woke up rolled
a couple of months ago
they got my harp and they got my dollar
them low life so and so's
harps cost money and I ain't got it
it's my own fault I suppose


The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
two freights everyday
if it was just me I'd be headed south
but Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
says we gotta wait and see
in my heart I know it's a little boy
hope he don't end up like me


Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
hope she don't break down and cry


Marie she didn't wake up this morning
she didn't even try
she just rolled over and went to heaven
my little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
caught a Chesapeak on the fly
Marie will know I'm headed south
so's to meet me by and by


Marie will know I'm headed south

Guy Clark,"Well the wicked king of clubs awoke
And it was to his queen turned
His lips were laughing as they spoke
His eyes like bullets burned

The sun's upon a gambling day
His queen smiled low and blissfully
Let's make some wretched fool to play
Plain it was she did agree

He send his deuce down into diamond
His four to hart, and his trey to spade
Three kings with their legions come
Preparations soon where made

They voted club the days commander
Gave him an army face and number
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds
And the aces in the sky

Well, he gave his sevens first instructions
Spirit me a game of stud
Stakes unscarred by limitation
Between a man named Gold and man named Mud

Club filled Gold with greedy vapors
Till his long, green eyes did glow
And Mud was left with the sighs and trembles
Watching his hard earned money go

Flushes fell on Gold like water
Tens they paired and paired again
But the aces only flew through heaven
And the diamond jack called no man friend

Now, the Diamond Queen saw Muds ordeal
Began to think of her long lost son
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy
And prayed to the angels every one

Now, the Diamond Queen, she prayed and prayed
And the Diamond Angel filled Muds hole
The wicked King of Clubs himself
Fell in face down in front of Gold

Now, three kings come to Clubs command
But the angels from the sky did ride
Three kings up on the streets of Gold
Three fireballs on the muddy side

The club queen heard her husband's call
But Lord, that Queen of Diamond's joy
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall
Turned out to be a wandering boy

Now, Mud he checked and Gold bet all
And Mud he raised and Gold did call
And the smile just melted on his face
When Mud turned over that diamond ace

Now, here's what this story's told
If you feel like Mud you'll end up Gold
If you feel like lost, you'll end up found
So amigo, lay them raises down",Mr. Mudd & Mr. Gold

",A Sailboat in the Moonlight
Guy Lombardo,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit
",Goofus
Guy Lombardo,"How much do I love you,
I tell you no lie,
How Deep is The Ocean,
How high is the sky
How many times a day
Do I think of you
How many roses, are sprinkled with dew
How far would I travel
To be where you are
How far is the journey,
From here to a star
And if I ever lost you,
How much would I cry
How Deep is the Ocean
How high is the sky",How Deep Is the Ocean?
Guy Lombardo,"I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same never be the same again
 
I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same

Once love was king but kings can be wrong

Guy Lombardo,"I've covered every little highway
And I've been climbing every hill
I've been looking high and I've been looking low
Looking for my Shanghai Lil

The stars that hang high over Shanghai
Bring back the memory of a thrill
I've been looking high and I've been looking low
Looking for my Shanghai Lil

I learned to love her
The little devil was just a butterfly
But you'd discover something on the level
Shining in her eye

Oh, I've been trying to forget her
But what's the use, I never will
I'll be looking high and I'll be looking low
'Till I find my Shanghai Lil",Shanghai Lil
Guy Lombardo,"Too many tears, each night I go to bed
I lie awake and shed too many tears
Your memory is bringing me too many tears

Too many years I wasted loving you
And you know I've been through
Too many years I cared a lot what have I got

Too many tears, I know I should have found a new love
And don't you think I didn't try?
But I found out a number two love, never seems to satisfy

I'll never learn to smile again and sing
I gave you everything
And in return what did you leave for souvenirs?
Too many tears",Too Many Tears
Guy Lombardo,"We thought that love was over
That we were really through
I said I didn't love her
That we'd begin anew
And you can all believe me
We sure intended to
But we just couldn't say goodbye

The chair and then the sofa
They broke right down and cried
The curtains started wavin'
For me to come inside
I tell you confidentially
The tears were hard to hide
And we just couldn't say goodbye

The clock was striking twelve o'clock
It smiled on us below
With folded hands it seemed to say
""We'll miss you if you go""

So I went back and kissed her
And when I looked around
The room was singin' love songs
And dancing up and down
And now we're both so happy
Because at last we've found.
That we just couldn't say goodbye",We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye
Guy Lombardo,"I'm young and healthy
And you've got charms
It would really be a sin
Not to have you in my arms

I'm young and healthy
And so are you
When the moon is in the sky
Tell me what am I to do?

If I could hate you
I'd keep away
But that ain't my nature
I'm full of vitamin A, say

Say I'm young and healthy
So let's be bold
In a year or two or three
Maybe we will be too old

If I could hate you
I'd keep away
But that ain't my nature
Looks like I'm full of that vitamin A

I want to say I'm young and healthy
So let's be bold
In a year or two or three
Maybe we will be too old",Young and Healthy
Guy Lombardo,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Mister florist, take my order please
We had a silly quarrel the other day

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
