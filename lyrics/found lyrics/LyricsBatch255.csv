Kurt Nilsen,"I don't mind if you treat me bad again 
I don't care anymore 
Life's too short to make trouble out of small things 
It is better this way 
I am sort of laid back today

I close my ears when words come flying out 
I have heard them all before 
Just a lot of hope flushing down the drain 
It is better this way 
I am going away 

I've tried and then some more 
Instead of dragging the both of us down 
Divide, separate ways 
It's never easy this way 
It's never easy this way 

My palms are sweating 
I'm barely aware 
Of what I'm turning down 
It's all for life that is what I've been told
I think it's better this way 
I will regret it one day 

I've tried and then some more 
Instead of dragging the both of us down 
Divide, separate ways 
It's never easy this way 
It's never easy this way 

Talk to me, throw the ball back 
I've been here before, there is no turning back 
Talk to me, just tell it like it is 
Just two afraid souls
Going at each other, at each other 

We're at the crossroads going separate ways
Time to say it as it is 
And if we bump into each other one day 
It will be better, then 
Maybe we can start all over again 

I've tried and then some more 
Instead of dragging the both of us down 
Divide, separate ways
It's never easy this way 
It's never easy this way",Never Easy
Kurt Nilsen,"Open up and let me in, I am getting cold 
I've been trying to prove you wrong 
But now it's getting old 
I've made some blunders, I've made a few
I'm full of regrets 

There's no excuse for what I've done
There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what went wrong 
Can you forget about it and move on 

Open up and let me in, I'm begging you
I know I've done some big mistakes
But don't shove me out
I cannot turn back time and even if I could 

There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what went wrong
Can you forget about it and move on 
Can you forget about it and move on 

I know it cuts like a knife 
The pain that I've done to you 
There is no telling of what's to come 
But I want to see this through 
If I could take it away, you know I would 

There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what I've done 
There's no excuse for what went wrong
Can you forget about it and move on 
Can you forget about it and stay strong",No Excuse
Kurt Nilsen,"Take a look at yourself you give me goose bumps through my spine.
And I focus on what's important because of you.
And when you smile to me I can not breathe 
And I end up laughing with you
Not knowing what the joke was about

You're on my mind
On my mind
You're on my mind
All the time

Have you ever considered not being so friendly to me anymore?
Just let go for a while
When you try to be someone else 
I end up laughing with you, 
But I know you all to good.

You're on my mind
On my mind
You're on my mind
All the time 

You're on my mind
On my mind
You're on my mind
All the time 

Tell me stories that I want to hear
Whisper in my ears so words won't ?

You're on my mind
On my mind
You're on my mind
All the time 

You're on my mind
On my mind
You're on my mind
All the time",On My Mind
Kurt Nilsen,"I'm on the road, I miss my home 
I keep on driving, to the break of dawn 
And every house looks all the same 
I can't tell the difference 
Who am I to blame 

Yeah, it's alright to smile
Got no complaints 
Yeah, I'm all right 
Claim to be the same 
But I'm not, anymore 
That's for sure 

If I start all over again
Would I have done it differently?
Would I be the same?
Just as every love, that grows to be strong 
I can't be there right now, another turn comes along 

Yeah, it's alright to smile
Got no complaints 
Yeah, I'm all right 
Claim to be the same 
But I'm not, anymore 

I do the show then off I go 
I've done the best that I can 
And as the sea goes up and down 
So do we there's nothing wrong with that 
I'm on my way back again 
Towards better and greater things 
If I stumble will you be there? 
Could use a hand 
Can I count on you? 

Yeah, it's alright to smile
Got no complaints 
Yeah, I'm all right 
Claim to be the same 

Yeah, I'm alright to smile
Got no complaints 
Yeah, I'm all right 
Claim to be the same 
But I'm not, anymore 
That's for sure.",On the Road
Kurt Nilsen,"Coming home with the sentence saying 'I've missed you'
And to see your happy face again 
There is not a single moment that 
I ever think the thought 
Of not returning again 

Summer went and got pale once more 
A brand new city I have to explore
I have been searching for good answers and wisdom 
I keep on coming back with less, 'cause I've lost them 

She does not know that a part of me has left home
And it's never ever coming back 
There is nothing I can do with that
She does not know that a part of me has left home
And it's never ever coming back 
Never ever coming back

There's no sleep for the living nowadays 
Hanging in there with a steady course 
I can feel it from the back of my spine 
I am totally yours

Autumn comes I've seen it before 
Another town it's not that fun anymore 
I've been searching for those perfect answers 
I need you more right now than ever 

She does not know 
That a part of me has left home 
And it's never ever coming back 
There is nothing I can do with that
She does not know
That a part of me has left home 
And it's never ever coming back 
Never ever coming back

Coming home with the sentence saying 'I've missed you'
And to see your happy face again 

She does not know 
That a part of me has left home 
And it's never ever coming back 
There is nothing I can do with that
She does not know
That a part of me has left home 
And it's never ever coming back 
Never ever coming back",A Part of Me
Kurt Nilsen,"You sing a song for feeling alive
You sing a song just knowing it's right 
You write songs when everything's a mess 
You sing a song to get it off your chest 

You hate to brag but you do it anyway 
You close your eyes when you sing to yourself 
Being what you are does not make a change 
You sing a song for setting things straight 

All in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all, wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

You sing a song for being in love 
You sing a song that made it to the tops 
Never get wise on music, just let it go 
You sing the song if it makes you grow 

All in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all, wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

All in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

You sing a song for making your day
You sing a song to take the pain away

All in all it's wonderful
But isn't there something missing 
All in all wherever you go 
There is always someone listening",Singing the Song
Kurt Nilsen,"Light up a cigarette to kill time
Pacing this floor another dozen times
If there was some way to express it otherwise, I would
Fed up on fighting over crumbs and dust
Don't have to be this way, a hollow trust
If we could find some way to make it right, we would, we would

And then the silence came, there was not a word to say
One hour felt like a day when the silence came
We felt it on our bodies, no way to turn it around
One hour felt like a day when the silence came

Can't hear nothing but the dripping from the town
Blowing kisses, no one to grab
Need to organize this life that we have, if we could

God knows what we have sacrificed
Guess we deserve the days of our lives
Wish we could learn how to let things slide away, just for a day

And then the silence came, there was not a word to say
One hour felt like a day when the silence came
We felt it on our bodies, no way to turn it around
One hour felt like a day when the silence came

God knows what we have sacrificed
Guess we deserve the days of our lives
Wish we could learn how to let things slide for a day

And then the silence came, there was not a word to say
One hour felt like a day when the silence came
We felt it on our bodies, no way to turn it around
One hour felt like a day when the silence came

Kurt Nilsen,"I've been walking in circles
Watching you everyday
I've been taking every care
Not to scare you away
I've made you my friend
You've put your trust in me
I'm a shoulder t cry on
Whenever you're in need

I've been reading your ways
Looking for a sign
Is there any chance at all
That I can make you mine
Well I've come this far
but there's a longer way to go
My chances look slim
But soon I will know

[Chorus]
It's tearing me up inside
Holding back for you
Feelings are hard to hide
They're 'bout to slip right through
It's tearing me up inside
I don't know what to do
I know I'll lose this fight
How can I let you know

I've been trying lately
To show you a secret way
I reached out to touch you gently
Stricken by your grace
I just hope that you see
And help me brake this pain
If I lose you by telling
It's all been in vain

[Chorus]

There was a time before when I thought I was brave
But now I'm here with you I shiver and I shake
I fight the words of love and it all comes crashing down
I close my eyes
I let them go
I have to let you know

[Chorus]

Oh
It's tearing me up inside
I don't know what to do
I know I'll lose this fight
How can I let you know ohohoh",Tearing Me Up Inside
Kurt Nilsen,"I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine

A woman's lies make a life like mine
On the day we met, I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
I started rolling down that lost highway

Now boys don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
I started rollin' down that lost highway

Started rolling down that lost highway",Lost Highway

I'm taking one step out of a time
So I won't fall and break my spine

Oh, I know I can change the hands of time

So take me back to Eden Garden
So I can live out my dreams with you

To give me a second chance

You judge me if you want
But you know you've made your point
Well I'm sitting here, in the centres lounge
Waiting on a recall

My feet's got going chains on
And there's no one to take them off
I'm getting restless and confused
Cause you're putting me on hold

Oh, I know I can change the hands of time

Kurt Reichenbach,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Kurt Ribak,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe

Kurt Rosenwinkel,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

Kurt Vile,"Go ahead tell me hello or fuck you
Whatever introduction suits you
I ain't tryin to fight
I'm just tryin to ride this train to make it home tonight

Hey I don't get it kid
Are you tryin to break my nose?
Or just stand around and stare me down in calm?
Where the hell do you get off anyway?

Well there's people out there who tell you lies
They get off on giving wrong direction
Well fabrication's my best friend but I ain't never been
So insulted in my whole life


Ridin' on the freak train,
Train, train, train
Well there's a whole new story there

Let it hang out like you just don't care and drag it
Everywhere

One day I'm gonna get me enough gold to get me 
Where I wanna go comfortably
They say sellin' is a little faster but now it's

Kurt Vile,"You were all alone got into this song
Anyway its strung to, it wont't quit
Never mind time, let the good times

Hear my my guitar, chiming and climbing
Finding all the notes that nobody wrote
In all that time, making it my religion

Thinking is rhyming
And click track timing
Finding all the words, that nobody's heard
And in that time, emitting my sweet vision

Overnight sensation, my all night and now a religion
Digging on my sweet vision of overnight religion

Talking and strumming
Swooning and tuning
When you looking sick, I'll alleviate it
Each chord I lay a shape
Make you awake, before you break

Overnight sensation, my all night and now a religion
Digging on my sweet vision of overnight religion

Keep all along
I wrote you this song
For the one's I know made it back
For the friend's I haven't had
For my sisters, brothers moms and dads
They are all my friends in a church beneath my chest
Hanging over me all night, it's alright

It comes to me like, yeah",Overnite Religion
Kurt Vile,"In my day I was young and crazy
Sure I didn't know shit but now I'm lazy
One day I won't even know what was better
Then again, I won't know much of nothing anyway
Two worlds, one on each shoulder
I'm trying to tell ya
Pullin' over on the shoulder
I'm driving
I know when I get older
I'm dying
But I got everything I need anyway, that's fine now
That's fine now
That's fine

In my time I was whack and wild
I was just being myself, damn
But then I sat there trying on faces
One that erase my discreet disgraces
Pullin'  over on the shoulder
Ain't trying
But it's two worlds, one on each shoulder

But I don't pay 'em any mind.
Christ was here you just missed him
Now I'm out going down second
To all the stores to see my friends
To find cakes, to find old ships

Then I'm laughing falling down

When but Jesus fever is falling all over you,
Believe 
But Jesus fever's fallin' all over
You believers and lovers

In a breath 
In a black bowl I found a broken skull now I'm already gone.
You can write my whole life down in a little book when I'm already gone.
I started shaking and my heart breaking, my belly crawls,
But Jesus fever's fallin' all over

Kurtis Blow,"Now's the time when things are hot
To show the world just what you've got
Just grab a partner,hit the floor
'Cause this is what you're waiting for
It's time for us to take a chance
So get on up,got out and dance
Just shout it out and spread the news
About those low-down Boogie blues

Now The Boogie Blues is nothin' new
It started back in '22
Some guys and girls were sittin' 'round
In a little club outside of town
In walked a dude from parts unknown
Without a friend,he was all alone
Dressed up in tails and button shoes
He taught them all The Boogie Blues

I've got a dance you ought to know
It's no too fast and not too slow
It's not to hard and not too easy
Not too straight and not too sleazy
Something different,something new
Something special just for you
Something just to rock your shoes
Something called The Boogie Blues

The Boogie Blues has got the beat
The Boogie Blues will move your feet
Feel the beat and spread the new
About those low-down Boogie Blues
The dude got up to whirl and dance
Just like a dervish in a trance
Spinning,twirling,up and down
Round and round and round and round
Just like Bojangles or Astaire
A dapper dude without a care
With flying feet,top hat and cane
You knew he only drank champagne

Just watching him would keep you busy
Make you feel a little dizzy
Such a sight for all to see
The Boogie Blues done to a ""T""
Leaping high and doing splits
The crowd was simply having fits
They cheered until their throats were dry
But soon he had to say goodbye

I've had a ball the stranger said
But I should quit while I'm ahead
Those splits and leaps are hard to do
They really take it out of you
But in a minute when I am gone
The night is young,it's far from dawn
You've seen the dance,you've heard the news
It's time to do The Boogie Blues

The Boogie Blues has got the beat
The Boogie Blues will move your feet
Feel the beat and spread the news
About those low-down Boogie Blues",Boogie Blues
Kurtis Blow,"Looking back through time in the corners of my mind 
I see you standing here 
Oh baby how I miss you 
And how much I need to kiss you 
Run my fingers through your hair 
But then again it's just my imagination 
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation 
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation 

Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be 
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me 

Oh girl if you knew all that I've been going through 
You'd have a change of heart 
But come rain or shine you're foverer on my mind 
Of my life you're the part 
But then again,it's just my imagination 
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation 
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation 

Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be 
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me 

Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you 
You stole my heart and I belong to you 
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you 
You are the one and I will be true 

D...D...D...D...Daydreamin' 
D...D...D...D...Daydreamin' 
D...D...D...D...Daydreamin' 
D...D...D...D...Daydreamin' 
You know I want you girl 
You know I miss you girl 
Come back,come back baby..oo-wee,be my lady 
You know I miss you girl 
You were my only world 
Come back,come back honey 
Make my day bright and sunny...yeah 

Come back ...honey....",Daydreamin'
Kurtis Blow,"I was walkin' down the avenue the other day
When I heard this crazy sound
It was nothing but a  guy with a set of drums
But he was really gettin' down
He said my name is Jack and I'm a rhythm attack
When I got a pair of sticks in hand
I got savior-faire on the bass and snare
And I'm here to take my stand
I got juice

The next to show was a guy named Joe
Came in from Kalamazoo
Had a Kango cap with a real smooth rap
And he knew just what to do
He was an outta work bricklayer,part-time conga player
Brought along a set of LP's
Don't do a lot of talkin',let my fingers do the walkin'
And I play just as pretty as you please
I got juice

There was a guy with a bass,had a handsome face
And designer clothes all around
He said I'm into threads,don't wear Pro Keds
But I can make that funky sound
I play Fender Jazz,I got razz-ma-tazz
I got style from head to toe
It's a funky sound that I learned uptown
And I'm here to let you know
I got juice

About a minute went by when another guy
Showed up with an old guitar
Well it hard to be from World War III
Or run over by a car
It don't look like much,but it's sweet to touch
They don't make'em like this today
It's been around,but check the sound
Then see what you say
I got juice

There was a dude with a bongo,came from the Congo
Had a rough beat of his own
He dressed real strangle,wore beads and chains
But he could rock you all alone
He said call me Chief and I've got relief
For those weary dancin' blues
I got jungle heat from a primitive beat
And I know I'll move your shoes,HUH-HUH
I got juice

The next to show was Kurtis Blow
With timbales in his hands
Well I'm known for rap and I play with snap
And I think you'll understand
Now I was taught to play in a different way
By a dude known as Delgado
He said listen to me and you soon will be
A timbale desparato
I got juice

What do you say when you're bustin' loose
JUICE,JUICE
It's good for the gander and chilly for the goose
JUICE,JUICE
Breakin' out from that weekday noose
JUICE,JUICE
Gettin' down on the one and up on the deuce
JUICE.JUICE",Juice
Kurtis Blow,"Intro:
I don't want a lot,I want just enough
So why has it got to be so damn TOUGH


Livin' on the uptown side of jive
Hustlin' a buck to stay alive
Lookin' for a ten and they give your five
Well it's tough
You talk to the boss,the boss is gruff
You ask for a raise and they call your bluff
You may get some,but it's never enough
Because it's tough

STRONG:Like a magnum force
ROUGH:Like a new divorce
MEAN:Like a three-time loser
BAD:Like an L.A. cruiser
DOWN:Like a limousine
BLIND:Like a submarine
HARD:Like cold concrete
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

You hit the street and you look for work
You don't want to be some welfare jerk
But I wonder how you get to be Captain Kirk
It's tough
Now Kirk has a ship called the Enterprise
He cuts the aliens down to size
But I wonder what he'd do with the uptown guys
They're tough

TOUGH:
Try to get some cash
When you're looking for a raise and they give you trash

ROUGH:
When you got it like that
And your woman's running 'round with a baseball bat

HARD:
Try to play it cool when the girl's all know you're an out of work fool

TOUGH:
How it seems to be,wish I had somebody lookin' out for me

Try to find a lover if you dare
Even if you do she just won't care
Well no one ever said that that life is fair
Because it's tough
Saw a fine young lady the other day
I started my rap,I had a lot to say
But she said she was goin' with a C.P.A.
Now it's tough

STRONG:Like a superhero
ROUGH:Like a bank book zero
MEAN:Like the Oakland Raiders
BAD:Like the Caped Crusaders
DOWN:Like a homerun ball
BLIND:Like an umpire's call
HARD:Like a cruel deceit
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

You worked all year to buy a brand new car
A Coupe de Ville or a Jaguar
But you didn't make enough for a good cigar
Because it's tough
So you went to the bank to try to get a loan
But the guy behind the desk had a heart os stone
He said ""You don't need a car,use the telephone!""
It's tough

TOUGH:
It's a way of life,lost your job
Your money,but not your wife

ROUGH:
Gettin' in the black,Uncle Sam's in your pocket 
And your woman's on your back

HARD:
That's the deal,had to get a loan just to buy a meal

TOUGH:
That's how it goes,when it's gettin' better,nobody knows

STRONG:Like Chocolate Thunder
ROUGH:Like Stevie Wonder
MEAN:Like Brucie The Shark
BAD:Like the Raider's Ark
DOWN:Like Sugar's Glove
BLIND:Like a man in love
HARD:Like a big defeat
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

TOUGH:That's the word,unemployment is all I heard
ROUGH:When you start your day,watch the finance man tow your car away
HARD:To hold a job when you've been replaced by a little blue knob
TOUGH:Like a dollar steak,ain't someone ever gonna give me a break

(intro) 

There are 8 million stories in the naked city 



8 million stories (x4) 



(verse one Kurtis blow) 



There are 8 million stories in the naked city 

Some ice cold and told without pity 

About the mean streets and the guetto culture 

The pimps the pushers the sharks and vultures 

Things that happen when it reaches dark 

And all the things you hear about Central Park 

You got to be down,you got to have strength 

If you're gonna survive past 110th 

Well it ain't no thing when blood is spilled 

The emergency ward is capacity filled 

And nothin' ever comes as a big surprise 

And the naked city never closes its eyes 

A new story every day 

Told a thousand different ways 

That's how it is and that's how it goes 

The city with the 8 and six big O's 



New York is a crazy city man..... 



Yo, my home boys Run DMC 



(verse two Run DMC) 



A young girl seemed to be gaining weight 

Her parents all thought it was the food she ate 

Their attitudes were all la-de-da-de 

But little did they know there's a baby in the body 

She tried to hide it,but they'll soon know 

Because sooner or later that baby's got to show 

Can her daddy just accept it as a fact 

That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack 

Then there's another girl,her name is Vicki 

The girl is fine,but sho'nuff tricky 

Vicki's fine,,but then she's not very kind 

She'll lay you down and then she'll rob you blind 

You wake up in the morning and you're feelin' blue 

Because Vicki is gone and your money is too 

She's more sinister than Peter Lorre 

And this is just two of 8 million stories 



8 million stories (x12) 



(verse three Kurtis Blow) 



Fresh kid and the stories complete 

Born on a dim lit ghetto street 

Father unknown,mother astray 

He learned about life the real hard way 

Wearin' pretty things for all the ladies to see 

Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry 

Spent all his time just counting his bank 

Because he's a fly muh-ha-ha,now fill in the blank 

Because he's a fresh kid and his money's long 

Been the subject of a ghetto song 

Poor kids admire,ladies desire 

They say water can't put out this fire 

Because he's a fresh kid,yeah he's alright 

Grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night 

And you could measure or even treasure 

The thought that cocaine became his pleasure 

Puruvian rock never cut with speed 

And he gets skied until his nose would bleed 

And that was just one weakness,must admit 

That when he took a hit he could never quit 

Because he's one slick pusher livin' day by day 

When the crazy thing happened along the way 

You know he started to base at a hell a pace 

And now it's a disgrace,he's got the pipe in his face 

For twenty-four seven a terrible Jones 

Didn't take care of business,didn't answer the phone 

He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone 

Just bittin' on a pipe like a dog on a bone 

Turnin' blue in the face,by holdin' his breath 

With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest 

But then he tried to stop,but it never worked 

And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk 

Just to break it all down,you know he's not very slick 

Because he spent all his money and he spent it real quick 

He lost his car,his house,his friends and his wife 

And basing cocaine made him lose his wife 

Because he bought some on credit and couldn't pay 

And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away 

In a blaze of glory in his own territory 

8 million stories sad but all real stories

Gotta realize that he goes way back
And now he's down with the king
And we could never be whack
So just kick off you shoes and relax your feet
And rock to the rhythm of the Kurtis Blow beat
Yes,yes,y'all and just shake butt

Kurtis Blow,"Chours:
They're playing Basketball,
We love that Basketball,
They're playing Basketball,
We love that Basketball

(Now rapping Basketball, Number 1, Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport,
I like the way they dribble up and down the court,
Just like I'm the King on the microphone, so is Dr. J and Moses Malone,
I like Slam-dunks, take me to the hoop,
My favorite play is the alley-oop,
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go,
Cause it's Basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow,

Chours

I used to go to dinner, and then take the girl,
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl,
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West,
To play Basketball at it's very best,
Basketball has always been my thing,
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King,
And number 33, my man Kareem,
Is the center on my starting team,

(To the hoop, ya'll, Watch out, Watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete,
Now these players, could never be beat,
Isiah, and Iceman too,
Just give 'em the ball, and then you talk up too,
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene,
And Ralph Sampson is really mean,
Bill Russell didn't take no junk,
and Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk,
Tell me, were you in the joint?,
The night Wilt scored 100 points,
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back,
And didn't give nobody, no kind of slack,
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team,
With moves that came right out of a dream,
Or when, Willis Reed stood so tall,
Playing D with desire, it's Basketball,",Basketball
Kurtis Blow,"I'm about to squeeze off on everyone that I know
'Cause every time they see me they ask for dough
They think I'm rich 'cause my name is Kurtis Blow

I can't stand it,I can't take it no more

(I can't stand it,I can't take it no more) (x4)

I can't take it no more (x4)

Lookin' out my window five stories up
I see a wino with a bottle he don't need a cup
And there's a hooker in the alley way
Takin' a chance,tryin' to make a days pay
But the rats in the alley are takin' a stand
Chewin' on somethin' that used to be a man

I can't stand it,I can't take it no more (x2)

I can't take it no more (x4)

Gun shots just up the block
By a kid whose head is hard as a rock
A lady with a baby who was crossing the street
Gets hit by a bullet and falls off her feet
The people gather round,the baby is crying
The ambulance is late and the lady is dying
The trigger happy did not step off that day
But the lady with the baby was a D-O-A

I can't stand it,I can't take it no more (x2)

I can't take it no more (x8)",I Can't Take It No More

(VERSE ONE)
Hello party people,I'm Kurtis Blow
King of the rap and a 10 years pro
The ladies heart stopper,the fly guys best
A sureshot rocker and I'm always fresh
But when I try make it,they try to take it
And it ain't in my nature just to fake it
So bust my moves,you'll never stop me
I'm the best MC,I could never be

(CHORUS)

(VERSE TWO)
Here I am rappin',they call me the king
But there's more to me than just doing my thing
want to move ahead,got to make a choice
Got to make this planet hear my voice
Lebanon,Russia,Iraq and Iran
Too many people dyin' playing Superman
Be cool,don't be no fool
Please Mr.Reagan don't put me

(CHORUS)

(VERSE THREE)
I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to see
To make it today we need unity
Do not fear reality
'Cause they can't stop what was meant to be(Even under fire)

Trying hard to make through the easy way of life
Thinking you can fake it with a pistol or a knife
You live it,you give it,you do it,you blew it
And then you want to tell everybody you knew it
It's easy to point your fingers
And say you and you and you're wrong
But when it's time to be about unity
Huh-huh-huh you sing another song

Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby,baby

Well I am the member of a new breed
And the solution is a revolution
So I hope you all see the light
Hear my name....Unite!To the next phase

As I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms

Kurtis Blow,"Clap your hands, everybody
If you got what it takes
'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
That these are the breaks

Breakes on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar
Breaks to win and breaks to lose
But these here breaks will rock your shoes
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!

If your woman steps out with another man
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And she runs off with him to Japan
And the IRS says they want to chat
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill
With eighteen phone calls to Brzil
And you borrowed money from the mob
And yesterday you lost your job
Well, these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up

Throw your hands up in the sky
And wave 'em 'round from side to side
And if youdeserve a break tonight
Somebody say alright!
(All right) Say ho-oo!
(Ho-oo!) And you don't stop
Keep on, somebody scream!
(Owwwww!) Break down!

Breaks on a stage, breaks on a screen
Breaks to make your wallet lean
Breaks run cold and breaks run hot
Some folks got 'em and some have not
But these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down!

To the girl in brown, stop messing around
(Break it up, break it up)
To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do?
To the girl in green, don't be so mean
And the guy in red, say what I said
Break down!

Brakes on a plane, brakes on a train
Breaks to make you go insane
Breaks in love, breaks in war
But we got the breaks to get you on the floor
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down! Yo!

Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!

You say last week you met the perfect guy
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And he promised you the stars in the sky
He said his Cadilac was gold
But he didn't say it was ten years old
He took you out to the Red Coach grill
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
And he told you the story of his life
But he forgot the part about...his wife! Huh! Huh!
Well, these are the breaks!
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down!",The Breaks
Kurtis Blow,"'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house
Hold it now! Wait, hold it. That's played out. Hit it!

Don't you give me all that jive about things you wrote before I's alive
'Cause this ain't 1823 -- ain't even 1970
Now I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know
So every year just about this time, I celebrate it with a rhyme

Gonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good
Gonna rock shock clock it through your neighbourhood
Gonna read, gonna sing it till it's understood
My rappin' bout to happen like a knee you've been slapping
Or a toe you've been tapping on a hunk of wood

Bout a red-suited dude with a friendly attitude
And a sleigh full of goodies for for the people on the block
Got a long white beard, maybe looks kind a weird
And if you ever see him, he could give you quite a shock

Now people let me tell ya bout last year
When the dude came flying over here
Well, the hog was out, snow's on the ground
Folks stayed in to party down
The beat was thumping on the box, and I was dancing in my socks
And the drummer played at a solid pace
And a taste of the bass was in my face
And the guitar player layed down a heavy layer
Of the funky junky rhythm of the disco beat
And the guy with the 88's started to participate
And I could sure appreciate a sound so sweat

We were all in the mood so we had a little food
And a joke, and a smoke, and a little bit of wine
When I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof
Could it be or was it me? I was feeling super fine
So I went to your attic where I thought heard the static
On the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in
But the noise on the top was a reindeer clop
Just a trick St. Nick, and I let the sucker in

He was roly, he was poly, and I said, ""Holy moly!
You got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin""
He allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd
On the point of his jaw where the skin should've been
Gets cool for a fool going out every Yule
For a day on a sleigh when the cold went low
So the beard may be weird but I'll never have it sheared
'Cause it's warm in the storm when it's ten below

I said, ""You're right, it's cold tonight
But can you stop for a drop before you go?""
He said, ""Why not if the music's hot?
And I'll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe""
So he went downstairs and forgot his guests
And he rocked the spot and danced like a pro
And every young girl tried to rock his world
But he boogie oogie oogied til he had to go

And before he went, this fine old gent
Brought a gift with a sift through his big red bags
In the top or the bottom, he reached in and got 'em
Toys for the boys, for the girls glad rags
And the grownups got some presents too
A new TV and a stereo
A new Seville bout as blue as the sky
The best that money couldn't buy
'Cause money could never ever buy the feeling
The one that comes from not concealing
The way you you feel about your friends
And this is how the story ends

The dude in red's back at the Pole
Up north where everything is cold
But if he were right here tonight
He'd say, Merry Christmas and to all a good night",Christmas Rappin'

Young nigga with a rep, kept that gangsta step
Crocka sacs of blue cordiroy with house shoes on

Hangin in the park till all hours of dark
Tryna catch a mark slippin wit this thang that bark
Cry baby on the swamp got the exit locked
And ain't no doubt comin out he gone wreck ya not
Pass me the satin locs so I can wet my throat
While I sag the blue khakiswit tha raoder coat
All the hoes really want is gangstaz just like us
Ruff and don't give a fuck ain't that right Kurupt (thas right)

Then the gangstaz rob with the gangsta glide
'cause gangstaz move, and gangstaz groove
And most gangstaz got nuthin ta lose
Gangstaz live, and gangstaz die
Gangstaz form a gang and the gang multiply
Gangstaz give a fuck a g, don't ask why
Gangstaz don't snitch, and gangstaz don't cry
Gangstaz boogie, gangstaz don't dance
Gangsta pull the strap out cha' pants and blast
Gangstaz don't run, and gangstaz don't hide

And I'm not captive
Free as a bird to fly out on Perv

Just to say a little somethin'
Rack up the gauge, spray a lil' something'
My momma always told me
Right before she'd hold me:
""Look, don't tell me, don't say it, just show me""
Over and over again
It sunk in slowly
I'm a bomb shell
Bomb-o-rama, high times is proper
I'm eqipped with four clips
And all the accessories
For all them Sesame Street G's

My bomb drops, my five glocks, and my knots
How you gonna tell me what I'm gonna do?
When I'm not
When I'm hot
Is when you can consider it got
In one false move
Is when the vaults move
Cracked in the middle like eggs
Spread on the table
Your pulse halts
Boy, get your game together
This ain't to die together
?This ain't the ain't together?
Now ain't this somethin'?

Hold up!

Fool across the across the bridge with six kids, get clips

And all gold in the bones
Hit the strip club
Get a little sip, get my dick rubbed
What the fuck?!
They love Kurupt!
But I don't give 'em a sip
It ain't because they don't deserve it
It's cause they love Kurupt and love how Kurupt be swervin'
And if Kurupt make 'em bounce
Indeed, I make 'em bounce
And blaze the weed
And rock the party with an ounce, now bounce

With a pin I'm a king like Kurupt 
When I throw a style, you better duck 
And if you don't your ass is out of luck 
Don't fuck with the master if I have to 
Then I blast you, then go to Church and see my pastor 
Why you have to be like this, me and the mic's tight 
Like lettuce, lighting the pimps 
This year my son turned six 
If your style's wack then you need to get that shit fixed 
Brothers hittin Jersey, my raps hitting harder than bricks 

I'm iller, willer than your local drug dealer 
Come to my villa, meet the 9-milla 
Letting off, where I stop you getting off 
Make you feel it just like Latifah's kiss in Set It Off 
You want war come on, put on the boxing gloves 
People call me an artist on the canvas 'cause I draw blood

You be ass out like a flat tire without a spare 
I declare war before I have to even a score 
You got me hot like sand on the shore 
I'm running the floor like a ballerina 
I go back like Flavor Flav and comb Adina 
I get honeys to make you say ""You seen her?"" 

I'm pregnant but only in my mind 
Hopin my baby rhyme grows to be a triple platinum album 
A felon, using the steel to do crimes 
Smoke so many niggaz they put up no smoking signs 
Charismatic, gasmatic, ballin like Madden

Raw doggs, raw deals, niggaz either ill, fake, or real 
Penetrates, own the 10's and 38's 
Ridahs and niggaz turn the states and flippin crates 
Get lift like weights, bust and radiates 
Spreading infection, murderous mafia connections 
I want it felt, touch life's villains 
Start drilling, start ampin out 
Hitting them with autos campin out 
With autos innovative, calculative, creative 
Touch a nigga, hectic, with a couple of seconds to bust nigga 
From a distance, I could peep a fuck up

From the blast then the smash and the cash and the credit

I'm like bitch, forget it
Let it loose bitch, won't you let it
For ????? I get a bad bitch from Connecticut
A typical hoe

And watch how I rock and lock the block down
Tightly to fight me will cause disaster
No chance to surpass the vocab I master
As the sun rotate, took my guns off safe
Been a thug since 8, always drug my weight
I state the facts, mothafuck a platinum plaque
Always got my stack jackin off from havin a sack
Niggas act as if they back is stiff and can't put work in
Shake the turf then get to tuckin they shirts in
But I'ma stay bangin

Impact the dumpa in the stash spot mash out
Knock it locked up with the ass drop

Load to tunes from ""The Blue Lagoon""
Mask on, khakis, ounced on house shoes
So I'ma start it off skitzin on the first nigga
Saul hit the stack, heard me, hear me?
Heard that, word don't pass the front do'
before you gotta show em your heart and soul and Desert Eagle fo'
Explode then watch em fold, the other niggaz froze
He knew better, mask in an all blue sweater
Two pumps ready for a riot
Full Baretta, six hostages with a loss of oxygen
Wet as a river, sixteen bricks to flip
After I flip these bitch niggaz for they shit
I been down with the twist since eighty-six
Hyperactive with a automatic, snappin reaction
I'm sick of waitin, a thirty-eight, I'm jackin for Daytons
Kick the door in for sure, double four's rammin
Hollow bandit, ready to knock him off if he standin
Position the cannons, telegraph the whole parameter
Paralyze anything that walks through perimeter
Cervical veins lacerated lost to missiles
Interrogated and I paraded posted with pistols
Time for war this is when the heart's exposed
Change up the game, cockin and sparks explode
I'm a marksman, touch of death, ten steps to draw
And that's all, end to anything before
In a world war, off like a Concorde jet
But fool, D.P.G.'s the set
In a world war, this is when the heart's exposed
Change up the game, cock, sparks explode
Manic-depressive panic and then start skitzin
Not givin a fuck while all y'all bitchin
Dis is for all my G's, my ho-mies
Flippin birds and servin ki's

Tryin to see and pour 6 feet of gravel on top of me
And all my playaz go to wakes so the next nigga can take my place
And try to invade my space
Make enemies search for God like Ma$e (Yeah)
You should avoid catchin 2 to the face, so I can avoid catchin a case
You'se just another mutha fuckin rat in a race

Kurupt,"Yo, if rappin' was a bitch you'd have no pussy
Maybe tongue kissin', but still no pussy
Lookin' at me dumb I'll slap you so dizzy
Suppa so busy cockin' the four fizzy
Mad 'cause, I'm too fly and I pumped your ho

Crushed your flow you got jealous club me for
I sensed the hate, I used my optical
You was too close around when I pocket doe
First came the wishin', then came the bitchin'
Wanna know the secrets comin' from the kitchen

I was fine dinin', you was eatin' chicken
I'll bust a bad ho, nigga take your pickin'
Like a slut callin' bitches on my cell phone
But my bitches, try to take my fly bitches
I ain't just trippin', I can't trust niggas who ain't us?

Bringin' niggas who can't bust
I'm A+ wid it, I'm anxious to crush ya
Half tustla mixed with you just a busta
Bitch ass niggas get me rich fast quicka
Now don't tricka this supa ass kicka

Why do you hate on me?
'Cause I don't be trippin' off you
My image is stuck on G
Try to fuck with me this year
Get the 'beep' outta here
I'm so up on my shit
These bitches ain't gettin' my grip
So I still remain a G
But why do you hate on me?

How you gone hate on me? And I'm that nigga
That ride beats smoother than Ron Isley
Talkin' bout fuck Damani but steady eyein' me
Steady tryin' to see how good sex with me could be
Why won't you let me fuck?

And I'm the best thing goin', and you the best thing hoin'
Plus we got you on tape givin' head in slow motion
Undercover ho's be real soft spoken, why would you slash my tire?
And I got stock in Goodyear, bitch I'm all good year
Tryin' to fuck up my clutch so I'm forced to change gears

Dark skin, go tee with no beard
I change ho's like I change clothes
Young devil in the city o' angels
Keep it ghetto like cups with staples
Live from L.A. gettin' head from Rachel, now

Why do you hate on me?
'Cause I don't be trippin' off you
My image is stuck on G
Try to fuck with me this year
Get the 'beep' outta here

So I still remain a G
But why do you hate on me?

Why do bitches blow dicks? I don't know that
But I can tell you dis, you simple trick
Now you get it all you want
We roll joints we don't fuck with blunts, fuck a blunt now
Some niggas is worse than ho's

Holdin' somethin' on your chest let it go
I'll make a bitch blow balls like a ball and sing that song, but naked
Most o' y'all niggas be break and hatin' records
The most hatin' done in 8.5 seconds
Why you hatin' Snoopy, you hate Nate and hate me

Why you hatin' stupid and hatin' on Warren G
Why you hatin' Rasco, why you hate Damani
'Cause he wanna fuck Armani and don't wear Armani
Hatin' Gondee and hatin' Tredee, Tredee is like fuck' em
If they hatin the G, fuck y'all

Its over, it's over
Now we're over
It's my turn
Now it's over

I went from canapes to boards
Bands to no records (Sorry)
You ain't got the Bentley with four doors
K-you-are-you-P-T Annie

Recognize a real hit when you hear one
Postin' up at the playboy Mansion
I stomp like gortex, poetical gortex
Bouncin' to jigga in California

It's the N-A-T-I,
Aw you know the rest
Act silly high frequently they contest
I done tours across the seas
And been cross the world
I done it for all y'all, my cats and my dogs
It's over, cause I'm bad to the bone
Leave 'em, real diva to her own alone
I drive a Jaguar, so many different cars
Life as a pop star, shakin'em this hard

[Chorus: x2]

This is how life should be
My girl and my piece
Don't make me remind you
I stays VIP (Move over)
For all my dime piece and all of my G's
Hustlers and pimps with shiny wrist, makin' money
It's my turn to shine and my turn to floss
Like you played a game, I stomps the billboards
One things for sure, G's hit the door
Tone and Poke know, Natina does not play
When she get on the mike she say what she got to say
Dr.Dre and Snoop, no cause rep is ill
From East Coast to West the unforgettable skills
Bust from head to hand, sippin' on Rimy Red
Runnin' from club to club, nickels and diamond dubs
Ready to rock spots, folds and drop tops
Grew up in Gangsta rap, Natina be runnin' pop

Education's corrupt
It's all fucked up

Government's corrupt

Step two paces
Turn and entrapped in the middle of the frontline where the action's at
Head straight to the scope, it's like hangin on the edge, of a ledge
I play my part, piece to the puzzle

Heat's with a muzzle, a YG always in trouble
'cause of what he know, 'cause of what he knew
How he grew, up and, what he grew up to
And what he gon' grow up to be

It's nuttin' wrong but homie don't grow up to be like me
Temptation to touch, a terrible thing
A placement in your palm an unbearable thing
The street has many wars, infiltries, many ways

Lives lost, many K's, full size and mini K's
Comin' in many arrays
Many shapes, sizes, and shades
'cause boys in blue they just might get you

Now Bobby and Susy were unhappily wed
So Bobby shot Susy in the back of the head
Bobby got taken to the county jail
He put up his house and he walked on bail

Now Bobby's on the streets he's free as the breeze
He saved up his loot for his legal fees
He spent his whole bank quote on attorneys
Who got the case dropped on technicalities

Through the good and bad times, times bad and good
Missin' all the things that we used to have in the hood
Things makin' me happy, used to make me sad
It feels like the war of the world, fire in hand

Spread, head to head like legions of germs
Wrapped like pearls and shells make 'em wriggle like worms
We everlastin', Kurupt and Everlast
Lashin', ever ready sounds, spreadin' like rashes

Life is complicated, Kurupt, Everlast and Soopafly made it
For traded, supposedly stay shaded
They may lurk but we lurk too
They create the war that we fight for

There's only one life and only one way to be
God fear gotta give love to the G O D 'cause I can see
Everythang's corrupted, I'm corrupted
TV corrupted the public, niggaz yellin' out, fuck it

",Kuruption
Kurupt,"Yeah, gangsta's make the world go ?round
I heard that true
Make things go up an' down
I heard that's true

I been through the full court pressure stage
The homies gave me a nine, the first time I saw a gauge
The first time I put my feet
Down solid mashin' on top of concrete

Before all the ways of war
House an' car doors felt the rays of war
When life was simple as shit
An' we didn't give a fuck about a bitch, 1986

It's all about lics, heat in the streets
Trucks with the beats
Bitches with biker shorts, worn all tight
Tryin' to get a pussy, just worn all night

Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest hoes
Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
Back in the days, Elco's, S S's
The best is where the west is niggaz don't test us

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

Back in the days where them laces were thick
I was concerned with break dancin' an' layin' some dick
For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin' the smurf
An' I'm walkin' on this earth like I don't give a fuck

An' now I'm rollin' up in third gear
With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
An' corrupt my lifestyle, so shut the fuck up
An' back the fuck up with that buck free style

Nigga, what freestyle, nigga?
Walkin' on a razor blade
Comin' through I got it made, posted up in the shade
Comin' through to get paid, sunny California, baby

I got subs in my trunk an' it's bound to bump
Straight smashin', hollerin' out, ?Wassup, Kurupt??
Wassup? I'm fillin' in my right mind, one to the head
An' I'm on the smash, hollerin' out, ?Wassup, Fred??

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

I don't give a fuck, so fuck what they say
Nigga, won't you pass? Say, ?Pass the bombay?
Niggaz, they decide to ride an' they ride
Niggaz, they decide to lie an' they die

I can bust a fleet of hoes with my skills
I can make them hoes bow down, pay my bills
Think I can make them hoes convert to my will
Wanna bet I'll turn them hoes in the scrill'?

If you love a bitch, a bitch can drive you crazy
Anythin' a hooker do, it won't amaze me
You better be up on your game homie 'coz they be
They may talk a lot of shit but they can't fade me

If you hang around with suckaz then you may be
Another type of brother I don't want with me
When you compensate with bustaz you confuse me
'Coz I'm tryin' to stay out the penitentiary

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

Bouncing with my cutie pie
While everyone staring at ya shining so fine
The summertime heat got ya feeling so right
When she comes out like sunshine
In summertime
When she comes out like sunshine

Yeah, you ever popped in a spot and ya jaw just dropped
In an eight second spread she's all in ya head
Your about to touch the ground and damn near beg
'Cause she's the one, like Lisa Left Eye Lopez
Get trapped up, I'm a post up
Get yaked up, and then act up
Like what up girl?, ya done done it again
I'm trapped again, I want it again
Pretty short cuts or, hair to the middle of ya back
Looking just like that
I like short shorts and the tight jeans
And the summer dresses and the small feet, all petite
See that's what little bomb mamas is made of
But most of why'all suckas like cluckas that's made up
Treat her, however ya run into or meat her
I hope she got a head on her shoulders like miss Cita

[Chorus:]

Oooh girl, shock 'em now
Looking down, can stare you down, all around
The eyes won't stop looking at my baby (Yeah they looking at my little thang)
I'm flattered but baby
Better let 'em know (Tell 'em who's it is)
Oooh girl 'cause you are mine
You are mine you are mine you are mine
I'm so glad I've seen a girl like you
Who be down
I hope I can return, return to you
The pleasure you give me baby boo
Oooh when we do do do the things we do

What you looking so cute for?
I'm fresh off the up in smoke, Dr. Dre and Snoop tour
Bomb in your short skirt, girl make that skirt work
What you want a G like, need a G in your life
Every wonder what a GCG is like
Ever wonder what being with a DP is like
One night, I like 'em just like you
Me and Jon be	, in Venace by the beach
Try to see what we can see
I got a (?) a new Bonaville
I got a house on the hill, where me and you could chill
See the party starts at eight, but you don't come 'till 10
'Cause ain't nothing cracking, and that's when it begins
I like Carona's by the car load, Henn' by the cases
Save the Coca-Cola I don't get down with the chasers
It's a secret location, I don't want no skirts popping up trying to chase us
Mad 'cause why'all switched places

To roll the game rearrange change rain or snow
But for real explain the exceptional view
With the exception of an exceptional feud I view
Impose the arsonists to burn a bunch, extreme kerosene
Helium dioxide aquanated oxide acquitted lop side

[Chorus]
Baby this is it fuck da world
I'ma be the first nigga to fuck da world
Converse apparel inspired by..
Fly out the barrel five out the barrel

[Kurupt]
Just take position ammunition, convalescent Converse
Where we at first is where we at last, where we last cash
One last toke will make your smoke ride high
I'ma give everything like pushing the button
Now how does it feel when you die for nothing?
Metropolis crumble, apocalypse mo' lines surround and dine
Let loose in at least a Nam, calculate keep time
Finish the World War I've been a star
The knock quiminitar(?), strange and restrain
Retired and rewired, melodically molecules
Strategy and logic enables our positions then points us missiles
All sided equal... deeper than pistols
For instance... unknown the science of forensics
Get your backpacked like ten sticks
Hit like ten sticks hit with the effect of tense ticks inglow(?) sticks

[Chorus 2x]
[Kurupt] Baby this is it

[Daz]
It's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shootout or fight..
Boop boop hap hap, nigga it's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shootout or fight

[Kurupt]
Nigga you want war? Yeah right, I'm mic sky like stiletto
Holocaust to high school, roscoe to Vasco
Impossible lives the hospitalized
Franchise strip niggas is broke for ranches mansions avalanches
Alarms ring cause harm in court
Like platinum and gold
I've sold a whole, explosions hit explode implode
Popped out bodies dropped off on Rider's road
I've seen and foreseen the unseen
And able hardly able to separate the myths from fables
I'ma buy a Baltic while you purchase fireplaces
Poisonous supply and occupy in space
The midnight I could hide the dark until the spark
Light up the night nothing everything in sight
I'ma cross the finish line with both legs broken
Flow coke broken both toke smokin' (wha?)
Daz dilly machine dean two shottie
The life of a party is a live scene
Gastra.. neo kung-fu niastra
Monsoons swarm en route like harpoons
Young black Sinatra analytical ANTRA
A million percent proof bound to found the youth
Uncrude uncoil bubble and boil turmoil
Don't specialize and ill crack your bones
Now fuck with that (automatic cardiac attack)
Forced to front in your chest back, (?)no raptor arab(?)
Kuruption! Yeah that's me!
New word to the dome, cyclone stallone
Stainless steel momomamamarron(?)
Get done cloned and choke in stone

Yeah and that's how we doin this shit

At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime

But say a prayer, pray for the other ones
At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where the only water flowing 
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Here's to you
Raise a glass for everyone

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend

Kustbandet,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

The faith we share inside

There's nothing that I've ever felt like
Learning how to fly
I'm learning how to fly

The freedom to be in the moment
The reason for making a memory
Never wasting all that comes my way
As I take what I see
I thank God for our freedom

Nigga, we played questions, we ate X’s,
Played truth or dare when we layed bitches
Wrote about it then made riches, planet rocked and we stayed grittin'

Then sprayed kittens with Glade, spittin', display given, these babes diggin'
Off of that I been boss of rap, I been called the gat and that’s N9ne, nigga
Been all of that since I caught the mack and put ‘iancs and racks in my mind, nigga
Even when I shot them at the window, I was a grim nigga take 'em to the end, no men woke
After gettin’ their chin broke, but when the pen stroke, N9na been dope

Before I started claimin' my set (I been dope, nig)
Even before I hooked up with Tech (I been dope, nig)
Back when y'all was hatin' my crew (I been dope, nig)
Don’t gotta tell me cause I already knew (I been dope, nig)

Ey, let me let these niggas know how far it go back with dopeness man
Yeah, like a bean to a pinto, dope fiend to a rental
Hung like a trench coat like McSpears
With the children before her 5% of it always been post
So I been dope, nigga, purest form of that Montana
Throwback, nigga, put a bitch in check like back when Ike put his hands to Anna

Just eat the cake animate, please, then take a drink of this Bay Breeze
When I create these they really hate me
Face be shaky, cause it's dope shit they see
I been dope and I hope that you listen
Fixed ya like you did soap in the kitchen

‘Ol pussy nigga trying to be me
Wish you could be ass nigga and you niggets
Just ain't cut from my fabric,
'Cause I style on ya with a crooked nigga ripping I be foul on you
Short term niggas I’m a milestone and your style slow down
The Kutty Cal with set the clown on you

Yes, I’m that nigga with the clown persona
Bound to beat a nigga down to a coma
I was on a 56 corner, Then I made it, now i go where I wanna

From dancin’ all over the track like Oppa Gangnam Style

To be walkin' on stages, came from the IcyRoc’s basement
Now I feed off of my paper, makin' cream off of you haters
I’m worldwide with this business, screamin' “Fuck y'all,” independent
Did for Kutt dog with this industry, we’re not sorry and shit, Tecca Nina'

Been in rap long, you can take a look, my stats' grown
Cause Strange Music and Tech N9na is this nation’s backbone
I was dope in this song and that song way back home
Not a nare nutta trace of the hatin' cause ain’t a fuckin' piece of wack shown

Yeah, now it’s back on, preview into the sequel
Kansas City’s the pipe, but now I’m the Cavy you needin'

Kvety,"Night: her sable dome scattered with diamonds,
Fused my dust from a light year,
Squeezed me to her breast, sowed me with carbon,
Strung my warp across time
Gave me each a horse, sunrise and graveyard,
Told me only I was her
Bid me face the east closed me in questions
Built the sky for my dawn 

Cleaned my feet of mud, followed the empty
Zebra ride to the cirkus,
Past a painted cage, spoke to the paybox
Glove which wrote on my tongue
Pushed me down a slide to the arena,
Megaphonium fanfare.
In his cloak of words strode the ringmaster
Bid me join the parade 

""Worship!"" cried the clown, ""I am a t.i.
Making bandsmen go clockwork,
See the slinky seal cirkus policeman;
Bareback ladies have fish.""
Strongmen by his feet, plate-spinning statesman,
Acrobatically juggling-
Bids his tamers go quiet the tumblers
Lest the mirror stop turning 

Elephants forgot, force-fed on stale chalk,
Ate the floors of their cages.
Strongmen lost their hair, paybox collapsed and
Lions sharpened their teeth.
Gloves raced round the ring, stallions stampeded
Pandemonium seesaw 
I ran for the door, ringmasters shouted,
""All the fun of the cirkus!""",Cirkus

Kwamé,"Verse One:

Well I stumbled on a picture kinda made me laugh
A photograph, what brought me right back to the past
When I was a youngster
Quite nerd type, that wanted to be amongst the
Older, bolder, colder crowd
With fat gold chains and strolled around
In tucked silk suits, hundred dollar Bally boots
Hat to a tilt and a felt substitute 
Fashions my have seemed to have worked
But it seems I was a fake, and fakes look like jerks
All I could do is scheme
Hoping that one day I'll be on the top of the team
No matter how hard I tried, I'd just collide
With being a fool and an old guy
It didn't work, and that annoyed
And I asked myself why can't I be oneovdabigboiz

Chorus

Verse Two:

Now I remember one day in the 7th grade
A new girl came to school and I must say
I slid, skid, crashed and got a crush 
On her and all other things seemed like a bluff
I wouldn't dare to speak, didn't say a word
Trying to be a big boy, I just became a nerd
Doubting myself, thinking I'm all sissy and all
Either I was too short, too shy, or too small
Which was a sign of ignorance
So I brought up confidence
The next day I'm panicking
Stiff as a mannequin
What do you know
She doesn't even show
But there's tomorrow, the next day she came
Arm and arm with some dude, with some gangster name 
Hopes and dreams in a flash were destroyed
All because of the fuss of oneovdabigboiz

Bridge: Tasha Lambert (singing)

I'm the one that told you not to worry
You'll grow up to be someone special
Take your time and don't you hurry
'Cause soon you will be

Verse Three:

They all have eyes, they all have two feet
They used to pick their girls up but on a train we meet
Why can't I be a big boy I used to ask myself
And self said ""Why do you want to be someone else
Why do you want to wear what someone else wears
Or get a cut, like someone else's hair
Or be seen in someone else's glare
You know what I'm saying (you're right)"" YEAH!
I'll do my own thing speak my own slang
Be in my own swing, know what I'm saying
'Cause baby I'm a star
You know who the hell I are

I had everyone rocking the streets and wanting the polka dots

Yo, I met my baby moms in V.I.M. kid
Nigga shut up, you stupid
Yo, that's my word
Back in the days I think it was like eighty-five, eighty-six, I don't remember
I was up in there... yo
Word
This got me tripping, God
And you see how cute she is so you can't be trying to front
Yeah, she is fly
Yo let me tell you how the whole story went down kid
Peep this yo

I met my baby at the...	""V - I - M""

Now way way back, when when her, him and them
Couldn't spend loot on Guess and Timb's
We got fresh for less at V.I.M.
Shell top Adidas, Aptiva Kangol's and Lee jeans
No in betweens, you either had 'em or was wack, know what I mean
And V.I.M. was the spot to get 'em, one day my homey
Hit the Avenue shopping, and I bounced up there widd'em
The Ave was full of fly girls, but I wasn't on the hunt
All I wanted was my Puma's and a gold front
Stunts was running back and forth in V.I.M.'s, looking for someone to help
But I was like, ""No thanks skeezer, I'll get my stuff myself""
I was in the sneaker section, peeping out a pair of Nike's
When a sweet pretty voice asked, ""What size would you like""
I looked up and yo, I met these lovely brown eyes
Attached to an in place face, and body that can make your nature rise
Jocked honey for a bit, then said, ""A size six miss""
She smiled and walked away, yo kid, I got to get this

I met my baby at the... ""V - I - M""
While buying some sneakers, we fell in love
I met my baby at the... ""V - I - M""
While buying some sneakers, we fell in love

She came back to the spot, with a green Puma box
Took off my kicks and stared in shock at the FAT hole in my sock
Damn, the worst that could happen happened, I felt like breaking North
When honey burst out and started laughing
Thought about then realized yo, it was kind of funny
As I laughed and put my shoe she asked, ""That's all you want money?""
I was tempted to say, ""Um, can I have your number too?""
But I didn't want to play myself cause yo, that's not too cool
""Could you show me a pair of Lee's to match these, size 29?
And um, would you mind going with me to Mickey D's?""
Now where did that come from? Damn, I went out like a herb
But when she said yes to both questions, I was like, ""Oh word?!""
She paid for my stuff, plus got me a discount
Went to lunch and after that, saw each other a mad amount
It's ninety-four, but V.I.M.'s is my store for life
Not only did they help me get dipped, they helped me get a wife

I met my baby at the.. ""Vee Eye Emm!""
While buying some sneakers, we felll in love! 
I met my baby at the.. ""Vee Eye Emm!""

While buying some sneakers (cracking up)
I met my baby at the.. ""Vee Eye Emm!""
While buying some sneakers
Me and my baby fell in love love love love love love
Love, love love love love love
I met my baby at the.. ""Vee Eye Emm!""
I fell in love with her fell in love love love love

Ky-Mani Marley,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey

Let me tell you of a story
'Bout a creature I once knew
Had a wife that was a teacher
And the daughter was it too

He was loved among his neighbors
For the wonders works he's done
For the building of the new church
And the work for rodness funds

But things change and times got rough
And his wife is acting strange
And the friends Tom once knew so well
Just don't seems the same

Now Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Now instead of getting better
Things started to get worse
When they dropped off from the ministry
And burnt down Tom's new church

After all the things that Tom had done
It seems like no one care
Now Tom is sitting all alone
Shedding lonely tears

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Oh, oh, no, yeah
Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

Tom drunk
But Tom's no fool
Just keep it cool, Tom
And stick to the root

To much stress, can't bare the pressure
So he sips the Devil's water
Reach at home, he rapes his wife
Then he turns and beats his daughter

Can't believe [Incomprehensible]
Then he slowly caught the hammer
Put the fist into his hand
Then he bowed and said the prayer

Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom
Tom is gone, Tom is gone
Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom
Tom is gone Tom is gone

Tom drunk
And played a fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

Tom drunk
And played a fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

Tom drunk
Played a fool
Tom is drunk now

Tom drunk
And played the fool
And lost his crew now
He lost his crew now

Tom drunk
And played the fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue

Tom drunk
And played the fool
And lost his crew now
His soul is in the deepest blue, yeah, yeah

Say fool you must be crazy
What is it you tryin' to do you cannot faze me
I've been smokin' on a pound and feelin' hazy
For five-o I won't stop they gotta chase me

The seats in the ride is leather,the rims are clean
I change like the weather, now I'm the king, yeah yeah

Now if you want to find me, I'll be in Jamaica smoked out
In a black navigator,evading all the playa haters - high
Here comes the rover with the troops
Decked out in army fatigues,
And stompin' 'um with my black tin boots,say what
Now while you remixing punch lines, I create
How you want to battle me, hah
When you just a feather weight, hey yo
You know how long I've been knocking out heavyweights, its best you chill
Meditate find your space and know your place because
I'm like a disciple,when I appear from the clouds
I gets on stage I get the mic and then I bless the crowd, blow
Me and my soldiers we gon' ride tonight
Get some of the, we gon' get high
Babylon ridin' slowly,ah try fe hold me
Want to prosecute I for my Ganja
Babylon ridin' slowly,ah try fe hold me
Like they don't know,eh,what I'm tellin' ya

It's me a runnin' down in J-A
Twenty thousand pounds of Ses on the ship headin' straight for the bay, yo
Well I'm a check the rice around the weed
And all vibes have got me jealous and I meditate, hey
Now probably I hit the airways
I'm burnin' live 'till I'm back in the M-I-A, yeah
I say my soldiers from around the way
I call up shortly for the party we be doin' this everyday

It seems so very real to leave

With scheming ideas to excuse

Deserted from love they used to hang on

Into forbidden gardens

Your tellin' me that this is home

If it wasn't for the problems would you still be with me
If she wanted to start over would you get up and leave
If you had an option more would you be
With someone, someone, someone else

Please be honest
Be straight up
Just let me know
Was I your rebound on a low
A crutch a step a stool for you
The one to help you get through

If you wanted someone else
Would you be afraid to tell
Would you just stick around
Would things still work out in the end

If it wasn't for the problems would you still be with me
If she wanted to star over would you get up and leave
If you had an option more would you be
With someone, someone, someone else
Is it my imagination or is what I'm feelin true
If you could have your way would it be mine, just me and you
If you had an option more would you be
With someone, someone, someone else

I often think about it
How life would really be
If you would have the choice would you be here with me
Or else would it be over, would you stand by me
Love has no gaurentees but keep it real with me

If it wasn for the problems would you still be with me
If she wanted to start over would you get up and leave
If you had an option more would you be with someone, someone, someone else

Calling your name
When you're not there at all

Please tell me what I did wrong
Why must I hear your voice inside my head
All day and all night long
It's not fair

With these arms
I held you
When u told me u were dying
I had less courage it's true
And u wrote every day
Writing 'bout the things
That we could do
When your pain went away
But all that went away was you

I won't fall for them, 'cause I'll lose
And hold me, to none of my words
I don't mean them, when I'm with you

And the cars streak past with a life inside
Why is my life in your eyes?
And the windows glow with the hearts they've known
Why is my heart never mine?

I'm here trying not to bite your neck,
But it's beautiful and I'm gonna get

So drunk on you and kill your friends.
You'll need me and we can be obsessed.
And I can touch your hair and taste your skin,
The ghosts won't matter 'cause we'll hide in sin.

Baby you have a choice,
'Cause you burn my ears with your magic voice.
I'm a paper doll, you can tear me up,
We'll be the broken lovers with the poison cup.
And we'll draw in breaths like we don't have air,
Oh god, look at me, don't you even care
That I'm dying in the cupboard underneath the stairs?
Steps stamp on above my head.

Baby you're cruel to me,
But you see I love it when you make me plead.
I want a scar that looks just like you,
'Til then I gotta learn to be a wiser fool.

Baby you need to leave,

Because if you don't,

Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screening out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name

That shoots her to the moon without a boom just the tune
She holds in her heart
Watch you’ll be a star

I will watch you fly
Through the cracks in the sky
Till the flowers go dry

In the backyard near the playground there’s a soft sound
That hides inside a tear and it’s clear that she fears
The follies of heart
Come let down your guard

I will watch you fly
Through the cracks in the sky
Till the flowers go dry

I can’t lie you will do more than cry
There’s fear in the clear
Light inside of love

They light up the night so I see the road
The smoke is the cloak that I wear on my back
With darkness before me I smile more freely 
As soon as I strike a match

Have you got the nerve
To say no 
And let them bridges burn
Everybody’s friend is nobody’s friend, no

Where are you going with those greedy hands
I’m playing with powers you can’t understand
And now that I see through your hideous heart
The sweat on my finger produces the danger that 
Burns our worlds apart

Have you got the nerve
To say no 
And let them bridges burn
Everybody’s friend is nobody’s friend, no

Lets be clear here I’m not trying to be mean
But my life was better before you had ever been seen

Have you got some, have you got some
Oh yeah

Have you got the nerve
To say no

Kyle Britton,"The feeling of being wanted runs deeper than being had
Strong words start to stir when I’m a wasted lad
I can change, I can change
It’s a heavy hand I hold at the bottom of my pocket
A burning silver scar that I got from your locket
(I can change)

We’re two souls too bold to be running one another
We’re too hard to hold to the ground
Two souls too bold we’re lost in each other
You’ve got me walking on fire
You've got me walking on fire 

The sins of the sinner shut down the lovely way
Strung out and losing clout I hide inside the day
Can you change, can you change
It’s a poor punished person at the center of my core
A shining silver word that cuts me like a sword
(Can you change), oh change change

We’re two souls too bold to be running one another
We’re too hard to hold to the ground
Two souls too bold we’re lost in each other

Kyle Britton,"Dressed in black he calls her name
Sound can’t move in this place
He chokes on dust and years of lust
He longs to touch her face
In crisp white gloves and thin black lace
A crooked smile across her face
She’s better now than she was back then
The world has swallowed him

Known by so many not wanted by one
A vixen a glutton destruction for fun
Where true love’s a lie so why even try
Who am I

With a frown on his back and one on his face
Living a life two shades from grace
He shoots up love his favorite drug
He’s floating, floating away
Armored in praise she feels no pain
Held so high she controls the rain
He wants to give her more 
There isn’t such a store 
He’s falling, falling

A vixen a glutton destruction for fun
Where true love’s a lie so why even try

It’s a lonely excuse, which leads to abuse, it’s evil in use, don’t be confused

Our hearts have shrunk, the band plays on the noon-day song  and we're dancing with who brung us along, without a backward glance. Every day should end like this one. This night won't expire, but lightly sheds our bated breaths.

The dark draws taut, it's been jerked from both ends. The tension sings, but we're not listening. We've sweat ourselves paper-thin, lost weight we'll never find again.

I'm not happy where I'm going, I'm not glad of where I've been. I'm not happy where I'm going - every day should end like this one.

My mind is startin to burn
With forbidden thoughts

Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinkin' maybe we could
Well...you know

I don't wanna stop just because
People walkin' by are watchin' us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no no no
I want you
All I wanna say is

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.

Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.

Once again I've lost my way

Fall like dust upon my shoes

Turned my heart from higher truths

Take my heart to higher ground

I have walked too long in darkness
I have walked too long alone

I would trade the wealth of ages
For a warmer hand to hold
Though the path of life is narrow
But it leads the streets of gold

So take my hand and lift me higher
Be my love and my desire
Hold me safe, in honor bound

Never sure of what we see

Can you help me, occupy my brain?

I'm so in alone I feel so lonely 
Here on my own I've lost my way
I never dreamt that it could hurt like this, boy 
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss 
Why do I feel this pain
Loves just a dangerous game 

But the feeling still remains
And the embers feed the flame
How I hope you feel the same
So I love will grow again 

It's only you see you have the power
To make or break my day 
I'm getting weaker by the hour
Can't you hear me say
I can't face the world today

I would have flown to you

And now that I'm next to you

No more dreaming about tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow

It's all because of you

To know the purest love, the deepest pain
To be lost and found again, and again, and again

To taste every moment and try everything
To be hailed a hero, branded a fool

You can't give to me
Anything, I couldn't get for myself
I have needs as much as any man
And I understand the feelings well

I can still have a true heart
With a free mind
A good life
With a good time

But what is love
Without the finer feelings
It's just sex
Without the sexual healing
Passion dies
Without some tender meanings
It ain't love
Without the finer feelings

I get passionate, just like you
But I have a little self-control
You just show your selfish attitude
Your emotion leaves me cold

I can still have a true heart
With a free mind
A good life

We may be young
Are you too old to listen
We could be wrong
But that's our decision 
We may not have
Experience or vision
But we can learn
From your mistakes

We may not know 
The question or solution
When I'm calling
For a revolution
We'll learn to fight
All the bitterness and hatred
Ask yourself
Why were we created

[Chorus]
We may not have the future clear
We may not know the answer here
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough

[Bridge 2]
We break the rules
Some rules were meant for breaking
They say we're crazy
'Bout the risk we're taking
We may not see
The consequence of what we're doin'
But that's okay
We just keep on movin'

We could be wrong but that's all right
We may not know the question why
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough

I don't want to hear your reasons
I'm not giving you another chance
In my kindness you saw weakness
Time for me to make a stand

Whenever I hear your music
Singing the same old tune
You're so sure that I can't refuse it
But don't you speak too soon

What kind of fool do you take me for
Don't want to see your face no more
You can say you'll be true, I can trust in you

But baby you were never there
There was a time when I believed you
But now I know you didn't care
Don't want to hear your hard-luck story
It's the same time after time
It's too late to say you're sorry
You'll never change wrong to right

Trapped my very own self 
In the snare of my mind
No more space than a slither
What I'd give for a deep breath inside
Where the chaos has my captive
Where there's no exist sign
Where I fuel the stupid fire 
With these feeling of mine

Lured into this den, it's bitter 
And I want sweetness again
A taste that I agree with
Get me past these perils and to my Eden
Where the silence is a comfort
Where there is no one else
Where I'll be up from under 
Can uncurl my self
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far

Can I smash all of this open
Can I pass the hurt with a little pain
I want to see all of it crumble 
And start afresh all over again

But I can hardly see
Will laughter find a way 
Around these silent tears

You always keep me waiting
Because it's only make believe
And I would come a-running

My heart is close to breaking
And I can't go on faking
The fantasy that you'll be mine

I'm dreaming

What kind of fools are you and I
There would be stars up in the sky

But who's to say that we can't change our mind
My love burns stronger each day
If I'm sure of one thing

One love at a time
How could we throw our love away
When we had so much more than words can say
The darkest clouds would fade away
To bring the light into my day

If loving you is right
Then turn back the hands of time

I'll discover this ain't really real

I'm high above the Universe, losing track of time
And falling free
I can't believe that you are really mine

Down from the heavens and it gave me love
From a man who respects me
Loves my mind as well as my body
No retreat and no surrender
Equal to you regardless of gender
Giving me love that is warm and tender
That's why I gotta tell ya

You and I are of the same mind
It seems to me that we're one of a kind
It's true to say that when love is blind
But then true love is so hard to find
You respect me and the things I do
It was meant to be
I was made for you
Open the door to my heart, it's stopped
And I'm shocked....

What we really need
If the love has gone then you don't want to stay
Then hey baby we can go our separate ways 
Oh la la la la la
Oh la la la la la

I thought that love we had was
Oh so hard to break 
But now I know that it was all give and no take
One sided love affair is
Oh no good to me
I'm a woman and I've got my vanity

[Chorus]

You might assume like everything was going fine
When there was really something 
Deep inside your mind
Let's set it down then maybe we can work it out
There's no need to raise our voices
Scream, or shout
Oh la la la la la
Oh la la la la la

[Chorus]

Oh la la la la la
Oh la la la la la

I've come to terms about the way you really feel
I know the love we have is no longer real

Have I had your love
Is that the best you can do
You can dream of changing my mind
But your wasting your time
'cause if you think you've got me right just watch me

On the dance floor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dance floor
Got my body gonna use it

The best that you never had but now you've lost me
So come on watch me getting over you

Had your chance but baby you blew it
You never loved me and baby you knew it
And every time that you messed with my mind
I still believed in you

'cause I've had enough
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you
Have I had your love

To get down and boogie
All you can do is step back in time
Ball of confusion
When nothing is new, and
There's nothing doin', step back in time

Keep on truckin' along
Riding on a love train
And then we can float on
You'll never go wrong

Where do you end and I begin?
Awoke my senses yet you stopped time
You took me to a deeper high
The essence of my hopes and fears
Creation of my muddled dreams

With a peaceful smile
You are from the temple 
Won't you stay a while

You take me close to far away
And now I find and now I feel
The ordinary is surreal
Peace and terror all in one
My future life has just begun

It's a question of obsession
So drawn to your own reflection
You want someone
Like a personal possession
To shine light on your perfection
 
Call me up a thousand times
You're hanging on the line
Waiting for me to react
But we've been here before
And when I closed the door
I never wanted a second act
 
I saw it all clearly
But you didn't hear me
Thought our love was centre stage
But now that's all gone for us
And you are dangerous
And I can't help that

So drawn to your own reflection
You want someone

Gave my heart a thousand times
And I can't count the nights
That I cried myself to sleep
But now I'm so over you
And I see what you do 
Your sincerity's kinda cheap
 
Remember the mind games
Driving me insane
When my life was not my own
And even though you have gone
It still carries on
And I can't stop it
 
You don't need love
It's a question of obsession
So drawn to your own reflection
You want someone
Like a personal possession

Remember how you promised me, 
That life would always be good, 
You forget the fact you lied to me, 
You locked my heart and threw the key, 

I'm so misunderstood, 
What to say when all the words have gone, 
Promises, promises, 
What to do when all our thoughts have flown

Promises, promises, 
Remember how I gave my heart, 
And all at once we fell 

Apart, Was I supposed to forgive you, 
You forgot the fact you said to me, 
That we were for eternity, 
You're so easy to see through, 
What to say when 

All the words have gone, 
Promises, promises, 
What to do when all our 
Thoughts have flown, 
Promises, promises

Remember that I'm over you, 
And know that I will make it through, 
Hope you never forget it, 
The promises you made to me, 
Were really lies and fantasy, 
Hope you come to regret it

What to say when all the tears have dried, 
Promises, promises, 
What to think when all our love has died, 
Promises, promises, 
The promises we used to keep have gone, 
And with them all the words

That kept us both from seeing what was wrong, 
The rest is silent, 
What to say when all the words have gone, 
Promises, promises, 
What to do when all our thoughts have flown, 
Promises, promises, 
What to say when all the tears have dried, 
Promises, promises, 
What to think when all our love has died,

It wasn't always so
We did it in the darkness
We did it in the cold

Caught in a fairly extraordinary world
It's emotional
Where talking it rarely that necessary
And time doesn't count at all

Bohemian boys and Brazilian girls
Make familiar noise in a familiar world
Its like a million beats in a Parisian heart

Working the west with the girls from the east
Working a sweat from a million beats
Where oblivion stops and oblivion starts
(They're made of glass)

Love makes the world go round
I hold it in my hands
But it slips away
(And I watch it fade)

Love is a mystery
I hear it talk to me
But the words are strange
(Like it knows my name)

Love makes the world go round
I hold it in my hands
But it slips away
(And I watch it fade)

It wasn't always fun

But in the end we're one

Caught in a fairly extraordinary world
It's emotional
Where talking it rarely that necessary
And time doesn't count at all

Love makes the world go round
I hold it in my hands
But it slips away
(And I watch it fade)

Love is a mystery
I hear it talk to me
But the words are strange
(Like it knows my name)

Kylie Minogue,"I know that it's getting too much, baby
But you don't need the words to say
Sometimes you feel you're at the end of the line
But tonight it's gonna fade away

You're looking out from the darkness
Feeling so alone and you need a flare
Well, I've got the light that's gonna treat you right
And illuminate what's already there

Understand I will be there for you
Understand I'm a diamond for you
A white diamond for you

And just like a burning radio I'm on to you
Your spell I'm under
In the silver shadows I will radiate
And glow for you

What you see and what it seems
Are nothing more than dreams within a dream
Like a pure white diamond
I'll shine on and on and on

Where I'm gonna take you now
Every tear will look out of place
Well, I thought about it but it took until now
To crystallize it into a phrase

Understand I will be there for you
Understand I'm a diamond for you
A white diamond for you

And just like a burning radio I'm on to you
Your spell I'm under
In the silver shadows I will radiate
And glow for you

Are nothing more than dreams within a dream

I know you're feeling me
'cause you like it like this

Traded in some sorrow
For some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes
Got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past
Ain't no point in looking back
The future will be

That I found a new direction
And it leads back to me, yeah

Have given me the strength
To really believe
That no matter how I take it
There's no way I'm gonna fake it
'cause it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide
No reason left to fight

Kylie Minogue,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

All the way home I'll be warm

Kylie Minogue,"Got to have it
It's like a shock-wave to my brain
To get it together
I have a head full to explain
It gives me funny feeling
I've gotta find out if it's true
I'll give you the answer, baby
I don't know what we're going through

It's too much 
It's too much 

[Chorus]
It's too much--this kind of love
For the first time
For the first time
It's way too much--this kind of love
Not the last time
Not the last time

When you read my body
Can you touch my mind?
Will we make it happen
Each and every time?

They say it doesn't happen
But lighting struck twice
First one got me hot
The next was cold, but nice

Push me to the brim
And you fill me to the brink
I can't function
I can't think--it's too much

[Chorus: x2]

(Can't say what I feel)

Can't say
Can't say what it is
If I say what I feel, it's too much
Can't say
Can't say what it is

Can't say what it is

He'll be back at Christmas time

Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle
Our hearts were singing
It felt like Christmas time

Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you

'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this years been a busy blur
Don't think i have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left
From last year, ski shopping, counter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
(Most of '81 past along those lines)
So deck those halls and trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back, to spring time, sun again (why?)
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summer time
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him
No this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page
Of course I am excited
Tonight's the night but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go, (I'm sorry)
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

Cool
A and P has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn, guess what I forgot?
So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear?
In the line is that guy
I've been chasing all year
(I'm spending this one alone) he said
(Need a break this year's been crazy)
I said me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale to a very happy ending

Merry Christmas, honey

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Kylie Minogue,"The black is by the fire
The lights are on the tree
Elvis sings Blue Christmas for you and me
Everything is perfect
The candles have it glow
The only thing what's missing is that sub zero

Those things that we should do
There's people we should see
Don't wanna move an inch
Don't need no company
Just wanna be beside you
Just like it was last year
When all the lights were frozen
Could we move from here?

Oh, it's got me praying for snow
To start falling

Baby, baby, do you remember
That crazy Christmas with the crazy weather
And spend a weekend and closer and closer
I wanna do it one time over

Baby all we need is snow from somewhere
To lock the door so we can go nowhere
Getting back to you and me together
Now every year I'm wishing for the white December

We cuddled on the couch
We drank a lot of wine
Sang along to Fairytail of New York until we cried
Everything was perfect
Your kisses and Chablis
We unwrapped all the presents
Then you unwrapped me

Oh, just got me praying for snow
To start falling

Baby, baby, do you remember
That crazy Christmas with the crazy weather
And spend a weekend and closer and closer
I wanna do it one time over

Baby all we need is snow from somewhere
To lock the door so we can go nowhere
Getting back to you and me together
Now every year I'm wishing for the white December

With you
Just you
With you",White December
Kylie Minogue,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a Santa clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
'Till the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling?
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a Santa clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
'Till the other kiddies knock him down

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking, while we were talking
While we were walking in a winter wonderland",Winter Wonderland
Kylie Minogue,"Last December when we were together
I remember praying it was forever 
Didn't know, like the snow
Our love would melt away

Spring went by and then the summer started
Mid-July, I was still broken-hearted
Autumn leaves have left the trees
But these feelings still remain

Seems I'm not forgetting you as quickly as I wanted to
Now winter's on its way

Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy, but for me it's bittersweet

At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be, c'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

I know moving on is never easy
Wish my heart could change like the seasons
Someone send a happy end
To my winter's tale

Now I'm building me a great big snowman
When I hold him we'll be two hearts frozen
All alone, I'll keep him cold
To make sure that he stays

I am doing my very best but now I face the hardest test
As I've no festive cheer

Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy, but for me it's bittersweet

At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be, c'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at

Can't help but think about you when I'm all alone
Each time I hear Sinatra on my radio
I'd be in Christmas heaven
If only you were present
Maybe you're somewhere out there on your way to me

Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy, but for me it's bittersweet

No need for talking
Its by your side

I watch the sun fill up the room
The world it flowers begin to bloom

I need the rest of my life to get over you

Here comes heaven now before you
I was feeling lost inside
Here comes heaven now you've touched me
I can't feel, I can't breathe, I can't love, I can't fly.

Honey pours into the jar
Shepherd moods hug every star
You hold me close and feel me like a glove
I see your name in skies above

Water melts into the sand
My bodies shaking in your hand
To hear you say that I'm your destiny girl
Spend the rest of your life
Rocking my world

Here comes heaven now before you
I was feeling lost inside
Here comes heaven now you touch me
I can't feel, I can't breathe, I can't fly.

And when you smile that way
A simple word you say
It hits me every time
I can't believe you're mine
My loneliness is just a memory
Its only in your arms I wanna be

You're moving like the world a lover could do
I take the rest of my life and spend it with you

Here comes heaven now before you

Like armies have intent
Turning me to face someone
Who looks a million loving nights

lay off my back and look at stars
Think of all the love we gave
He writes it down for me
But I've already turned the page
And I feel the ground beneath me give
Close around my eyes and I am sleepy

where in my life did this begin
What happens now
If I admit

I'm tempted by your touch
I'm tempted by your moves
I don't know where to look
Don't wanna have to choose
Coz I'm tempted and I know
Where this is leading to

and promises and memories
All dance before my eyes

De l'écho (oh oh, oh oh) au sommeil de l'eau (oh oh, oh oh)
J'ai encore le goût des nuits blanches sur mes lèvres (oh oh, oh oh)
J'ai encore le goût des nuits blanches sur mes lèvres

Un canon sur la tempe

Nos joues qui se glacent quand on prend la pose
Nos doigts qui s'écorchent à la couleur des roses
Et tes jambes qui s'écartent à la chaleur d'un autre

Nos yeux qui se cachent sous les ecchymoses
Nos voix qui s'écharpent dans ce qui les opposent
Moi j'ai cherché l'écharde, l'origine des maux
Mais ton lit restera mon dernier tombeau

On se tourne, tourne, tourne autour
Moi je tends, tends, l'autre joue
Il n'y a pas de magie ici il n'y a pas de poésie mais
Il n'y a pas de violence ici quelques pages qu'on a déchirées

De la poussière d'étoile dans la poche gauche
Des peintures de toi enfin quelques ébauches
Je brûlerai mon linge sale avant que tu ne me fauches
Que la fournaise des corps me calme et me réchauffe

Du haut des dunes, objectif lune
Les comètes fusent et se consument, je me consume
Nos corps qui s'effacent à la faveur des ombres
Toi tu viendras m'éteindre dans la clameur du monde

KYO,"Dans la vie il y a les flaques et les éclaboussures
Dans la rue les petites frappes, des lions, des vrais durs
Dans la musique il y a des farces et les graines du futur
Et si souvent des coups d'État, parfois des investitures
Il y a des notes d'espoir, des images qui saturent
Il y a ceux qu'on ne voit pas et il y a les statues
Il y a ceux qui aboient et quelques vraies statures
Il y a ceux qui ont la foi et il y a les postures

Les épreuves, l'apprentissage et les coups de ceinture
Il y a des cœurs des réceptacles et il y a les ordures
On voit des bras qui se cassent dans la sueur et la sciure
Il y a ceux que l'on écrase et ceux qui exultent
Il y a les pièges, les arnaques, quelques âmes encore pures
Il y a parfois des comebacks parfois des ruptures
Entre ma conscience et moi, deux poids deux mesures
Il y a le temps des grands soirs et le temps des blessures

300 lésions et les rideaux se ferment
21 grammes pris dans l'atmosphère
Et tu me verras sourire du seul endroit où je brille
J'ai l'impression d'être là où il faut être
Sur ma photo un trou de cigarette
Et tu me verras sans peine un soir où la lune est pleine

Dans la vie il y a les claques et le côté obscur
Et dans mon cahier tant de pages remplies de ratures
Les pieds collés au tarmac on ne voit que l'azur
Il y a le point de contact et le point de rupture
Et dans la rue le manque de tact et il y a les injures
Et j'avais la larme à la barre, du sang dans ma cellule
Un océan de vagues à l'âme quand j'ai cru t'avoir perdue
Et dans mon cœur c'est la débâcle, j'aime tant la vie, ça me tue

C'est juste un jour de plus
Entre l'enfer et le ciel

Dans les bras de Vénus
Même l'amour est schizophrène

Avec le rimmel des exils.

Le rêve des dealers de banlieue,

Aux néons des hôtels miteux.

De tes vieilles idylles,
Quand elles mendient tes yeux
D’un battement de cils,

Que tu tenais ma main

Mes doigts sur tes yeux enfoncés, 
Car je les sentais exploser, 
Tes yeux, au creux de ta pensée.

Rêvait, quand ses lèvres ont pris feu, 
Elles brûlaient pour le réveillon

Top Sear, pass the beer, last to see a raj
(?) be beamed up behind the stove askin' how Maria pop Leer
Cursed style near, burst out a purse with the gods you jeer
From Star's Pizzeria, police hate the veer
Especially when the shots ring off in slow motion, when yo' head hit the
meter
You lost two leaders, at the same case speeder
Peter Slim Duch shook 'em down for his reefer
James chased the recent with a hatchet on Easter
Two murders in the 'hood, we call it double ?faeces?
Watch how I eat this, freak the best teacher
At the prayer with the preacher, I get (?) in the bleachers
And your girl, I might eat her
I'm a lover, not a biter (well, yeah)
I still catch her for a piece

L,"Our song used to be my lullaby
Now it's just a tune from days gone by
Now it only haunts me in my sleep
And i soak my pillow when i weep
I drop my tears
I drop my tears.

I remember when we danced
Then world fell away but my heart held to you.
I remember when we fell in love
I close my eyes. i can still believe you're here.
I remember when you left.
I cried as i prayed i would soon forget you.
I never will. i never will.

With loneliness, i wonder 'round in shame
As memories of you run down like rain.
Asleep at night i still call out your name.
As the storm clouds beat a cold refrain
Against my window pane.

[chorus]
I know that life is simpler now
But is it even worthwhile?
I said was it all worth it, baby?

I know that he's the safer bet
But i'm the best you had yet.
There ain't no denying
I ain't even tryin' to get over my baby
No, no, no....

L,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

*Talking till the End*",Intro
L,"Just cause this is the end 
Don't mean it gotta be over 
Shoot we friends now, partna 
Ooh based on a true story 
You can say you really know me 
Hope you feel what I go through 
Cause I'm just like you 
Home girls and relationships 
(All day) 
Can not forget the kids 
(Every day) 
Beginning to the end 
I gave you my life 
My heart, my story, my everything to all of you 
Is all of me, my story, my everything 
My life, my heart, my story 
My everything to all of you 
Is all of me, my story, my everything",Outro
L'Skadrille,"Une femme enceinte, jusqu'ici l'histoire est belle
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle accouche et foute son rejeton à la poubelle
Un véto avec des chiens morts plein son jardin
Au foot en salle, une grosse bagarre qui éclate dans les gradins
Pas des gue-din c'est juste ma ville et sa jumelle Fontenay
J'te fais qu'un triste constat de nos ruelles
Un mec surprend sa meuf en plein adultère, son coeur devient une pierre
Il l'étrangle sans faire de commentaire
Le directeur de la MJ a besoin de fric, c'est super simple
Il hésite pas à détourner quelques briques
Un pédophile échappe de justesse au lynchage
C'est normal y'a qu'en famille qu'on peut laver son ligne sale
Un adjoint au Maire, non un gros sadique
Surpris dans le train en train d'astiquer sa trique
Pourtant c'est pas le Bronx, c'est juste Saint-Cyr
Écoute mes histoires cousin, c'est le bitume qu'elles transpirent

C'est la folie de ceux qui marchent debout et marchent sur les autres
Y'a de l'être humain dans l'air
Y'a du danger dans l'air
C'est les actes de quelques fous qui veulent rendre fous les autres
Y'a du sauvageon dans l'air
Y'a du fait divers dans l'air
Y'a qu'un fou pour reconnaître un fou on reconnaît les nôtres
Y'a de l'Skadrille dans l'air

80% de ceux de chez oim ont déjà goûté à la calèche
Mel ou Tar, pourquoi ? Alèche
Souvent la fraîche vit comme en majoritaire dans ma tess'
Surprenant ils ont pété un petit indou dans la cess'
Et comme partout ça fait aussi tourner la fesse
Mals quand même arrête ! celle d'une trisomique
En tous cas y'a eu un hic et des convoc' chez les flics
Venu en costard pour un civil à l'hôpital
Ou un parpaing dans la nuque d'un îlotier, comment tu parles ?
Les vieilles laissées pour mortes à l'époque des arrachages
Les fêtes de la musique qui se transforment en carnage
Les retournages de poitrail au glock 9
Pointés sur leurs propres reufs
16 shit, scorpio B38 carotteur en fuite en tous cas rentre vite
Mais négro je t'arrête vite chez moi c'est Soweto
C'est juste une rue parisienne entre 2 métros


C'est la folie de ceux qui marchent debout et marchent sur les autres
Y'a de l'être humain dans l'air
Y'a du danger dans l'air
C'est les actes de quelques fous qui veulent rendre fous les autres
Y'a du sauvageon dans l'air
Y'a du fait divers dans l'air
Y'a qu'un fou pour reconnaître un fou on reconnaît les nôtres
Y'a de l'Skadrille dans l'air



Pas les plus à plaindre cousin, nos hlm sont rénovés cousin
Ce qui laisse de la place pour penser qu'à te faire lever cousin
On n'est pas beaucoup, juste une bande d'énervés
C'est assez suffisant pour te faire minerver
Des gros nambos qu'on dira trop vaillants
C'est à Saint-Cyr qu'on a retrouvé le type
Des reportages avec des R9 plein de came
C'est déjà pas mal pour une ville dite de haut de gamme

Laisse-nous tranquille ou à défaut car on te kill
Ceux qui la glorifient la regarde moi j'ai ma rue sous l'arcade
Un gros crochet du droit que j'ai pas pu éviter
C'est le cercle vicieux, ça me rappelle qu'il faut pas hésiter
Mais sa mère, ici ou ailleurs on survit
Comme poto Traf-ticent et ses 9 coups de lame
Beaucoup de sang et beaucoup de larmes
Comme à l'époque où sifflaient les coups de latte


C'est la folie de ceux qui marchent debout et marchent sur les autres
Y'a de l'être humain dans l'air
Y'a du danger dans l'air
C'est les actes de quelques fous qui veulent rendre fous les autres

L'Skadrille,"De la banlieue ou de Paris, toujours vif quand il s'agit de cash
Tous anti shérif, y'a des taffeurs et des apaches
Des équipes de 10, 11, rien que des bicos et des blacks
Aussi quelques gitans, asiat, indous dans le même sac
Pour ceux qui crient haut-les-mains, mais qui ont le coeur sur la main
Ceux qui veulent sortir de là pour la femme et les gamins
Aujourd'hui c'est demain, donc demain c'est aujourd'hui
HLM style, un gros danger donc un gros produit

Les jours sont souvent les mêmes, dans un hlm
Merde, petit reste plus en bas à fumer de l'herbe
Ou tu taf ou t'en tires une et tu gerbes
Chaque ruelle n'est pas faite que pour aller pisser
De taille, est la nature de l'homme, qui aime être en plan dans un h 2 l m
Habitation avec un loyer loin d'être modéré c'est frais
Car dehors on est debout et chez nous trop serrés
Mais sans 24 frères et 12 soeurs on n'a pas de toit qui coûte pas cher
Sors en douce même pour rien faire
Car si tu restes tu vas encore faire chiper la matère, énerver le pater
Qui te demande à quoi on sert
Assis comme des connards dans une banlieue quelque part
Ou dans une rue parisienne comme celle des 4 ou guel-far
Paix aux poulettes avec Extazik sur leurs débardeurs
Au gang members et ceux dont la barbe pousse en 4 heures

Aujourd'hui c'est demain, donc demain c'est aujourd'hui
HLM style, un gros danger donc un gros produit

Ça crèche au pied du lit, les anciens écoutent toujours OPP
On est toujours OP mais le petit frère dort quand même dans le canapé
On peut te kidnapper pour une barre symbolique
Pour faire du fric, j'ai besoin d'un big, d'un beat et d'un brolique
Chronique meurtrière ma rage est fait divers
Ça dégaine vite à la seconde, 200 grammes et des dizaines de litres
En négoce avec des tanges et des noiches y'a des bolides qui ont la goiche
Conduits par des mecs tous bourraches
La rage de vivre pour les gains et les requins
On est toujours au top même si notre putain de biz fait un flop
On maîtrise les vices, on glisse
Et les CP pour les grosses loc de chez Avis avec la miss
Ce qui compte c'est les chneks et les chèques
Et dans nos quartiers la croissance de l'échec est nette
Des petits étudiants qui te rentrent dedans
Avec des gros renoi à qui il manque les 2 dents de devant

De la banlieue ou de Paris, toujours vif quand il s'agit de cash
Tous anti shérif, y'a des taffeurs et des apaches

Ceux qui veulent sortir de là pour la femme et les gamins
Aujourd'hui c'est demain, donc demain c'est aujourd'hui
HLM style, un gros danger donc un gros produit


HLM style dans notre manière de penser, de danser
De découper et de caler ou bien de couper décaler
Des taffeurs et des brigands qui fricotent et fréquentent
Des taffeuses ou des rhenzettes à la culotte intrigante
Des dégradés aux boules à Z intermittentes
Et ceux qui laissent pousser pour camoufler leur tête piquante
Ça fait selon le tiek-son et les tunes
D'après elles, on assure un max
Et d'après nous on est tous bien sapés goss-bax
Fashion, à l'ancienne, classique, classe ou new-yorkais
Tous on s'appelle ma gueule ou ma couille, ok

J'ai déterré la hache et la colombe s'est fait graille au KFC
Et les tapins ont les lèvres gercées à force de sucer
Moi il me faut juste un foret de 13 pour percer
Un micro pour Bercy et puis la foule va crier merci
Si t'as poucave, à poil tu vas danser
Ça se paye comme un coup bas ou t'asseoir sur une bouteille de Coca
Des hommes d'affaires comme Babani Sissoko
Des escrocs mythos qui, après lynchage, finissent aux hôpitaux
Vas-y bouge si t'as rien à faire ici
T'es un peu comme un mec agin dans une putain de rave party
Mantes, les Mureaux, Trappes, Saint-Cyr, Plaisir
Fontenay, Chanteloup, écoute mon 13 coups, j'suis toujours dans le coup


De la banlieue ou de Paris, toujours vif quand il s'agit de cash

L'Algérino,"Je chante pour ceux qui n'ont pas vu le jour depuis qu'ils sont nés
frappés par le stress, trop de stress, coeur assomé
Frère l'heure a sonné on va faire l'effort de ce relever
Hey les derniers seront les premiers. 

A part dériver des fonctions, calculer des intégrales
ma fonction vitale c'est rapper, poser ma voie sur un beat lourd
aussi lourd que l'air qui nous écrase; cracher ce que m'exprime ce béton chaque jour
Partout le même stress nous éprouve
la vie est faite d'épreuves et les braves se montrent comme ils peuvent
trop facile de basculer mal et bien; bien et mal
mi-démon, mi-ange se mélangent tant bien que mal
Hélas combien de frères boivent la tasse?
La tentation attire trop ici, dans les favelas
paralysés par le manque de fric
L'Etat nous endort et nous laisse consommer du shit
J'ai vu l'autre coté de la barrière en étudiant mais la réalité frappe quand je rejoins mon clan
Vos clans, ce que vous avez vous même construit
parqués dans des HLM entre hache et haine
Peu de reconnaissance, nos pères ont reconstruit la France
ils l'ont même délivrée pendant qu'elle collaborait
1945 on va pas refaire l'histoire, maintenant en quarantaine dans des cités-dortoirs

Certains attendent qu'on cède à la haine, ça leurs feraient trop plaisir
Combattre le feu par le feu, battre en retraite
qu'on ait pas une flamme dans les yeux, une lame entre les dents
Les dissidents voudraient nous planter des couteaux dans le dos
L'Etat est organisé, le bordel ne l'est pas
Des voix s'élèveront -D'où ça sort?

Toutes sortes d'états qui te mettent hors de toi
M'as tu vu manger des pierres des creux dans l'estomac?
Pourtant loin d'être pauvre mais l'homme
S'rassasie que lorsqu'il bouffe un autre homme
Est-ce que tu m'as vu?
Pleurer, lâcher des larmes lorsque j'avais mal et après me relever
Le combat continue, donc j'me relève en paix
Est-ce que tu m'as vu?
Les tripes et les douleurs au corps
Ma rage tripler, mon coeur, la couche de pensées rageuses
Qu'en sextuplés, ça vexe
S'appeler Samir c'est dur même quand on est bien sapé
Que penser de mon pays? Sensé s'occuper d'moi
Mais ils n'font que décréter des lois et se trompent de combats
S'ils savaient c'qu'on ressent à force de nous tasser sans emploi

Est-ce que tu m'as vu m'taire quand ce prof me disait mon ptit t'iras pas loin
Et est-ce que tu m'as vu revenir avec le sourire
Dire à ma mère j'ai eu un Bac S, mon père et mes frères fiers
Maman c'est fou y'en à qui me croient pas
Est-ce que tu m'as vu étudier pendant qu'certains festoyaient
Remettre tout sur moi même pendant que certains sont en train de briller
Est-ce que tu m'as vu prier, tête baissée, recherchant c'que les gens ont perdu: l'humilité
Est-ce que tu m'as vu demander pardon, me laver de mes péchés
Mais le courant m'emporte et mes bonnes actions sont effacées
Trop de fiction dispersent, est-ce que tu m'as vu bercer mon petit frère, pourvu qu'il perce

Un seul coeur, un seul corps, une seule douleur
Une seule âme, une seule flamme, j'ai vu le jour un beau matin
Et une seule façon de se tenir: droit, si seulement tu m'avais vu sourire
Un seul coeur, un seul corps, une seule douleur, une seule âme, une seule flamme
J'ai vu le jour un beau matin, et une seule façon de se tenir
Droit, si seulement tu m'avais vu souffrir

Est-ce que tu m'as vu faire la manche?
Pour réclamer l'aumône, non trop fière j'préfères faire ma vision du monde
Sans mentir aux mômes, leur dire qu'la vie n'est pas qu'jolie
Mais c'est pas la merde non plus quand les liens familiaux n'sont pas rompus
Est-ce que tu m'as vu insulter un juif en Shaba
Vu qu'c'est pas sa faute c'qui s'est passé à Sabra et Chatila
Est-ce que tu m'as vu sombrer dans la parano?
J'ai l'impression que tout le monde m'en veut alors qu'c'est moi qui me renferme tout seul
Est-ce que tu m'as vu? Petit gars timide, tchatcheur fébrile
Qui tremble quand une fille l'regarde, est-ce que tu m'as vu rêver
Garçon ambitieux avant de me réveiller à 20 ans
Tombé dans une flaque de contentieux, est-ce que tu m'as vu trimer?
M'sentir opprimé ? Soi-disant poète, en attendant qu'la vie me donne ce que je souhaite
Le temps de la gloire, m'asseoir sur la célébrité, mais tout ça rime avec fébrilité
Est-ce que tu m'as vu révolté du système, quand j'allume la télé personne ne me ressemble
Au parlement personne ne me représente, quand on parle de mes semblables c'est que des braqueurs
On ferme les yeux sur eux quand ils sont professeurs

Un seul coeur, un seul corps, une seule douleur

Loin de toutes tractations

Rester droit telle est ma direction

et si peu de mots si bien que tout se mélange dans ma tête
le désordre est proclamé la folie se mêle à ma raison
et là je me lâche je me sens bien ouais, on marchera fier sans sombrer dans l’orgueil
la vanité et le plus cérébral abnégation courage
comme monture on prendra la place du Calife L’Algerino 

On m’prendra sûrement pour un fou un mec qui n’avait rien d’autre à foutre
que d’noircir ses feuilles blanches raconter son vécu de merde

et de shit histoire de faire du chiffre 
Le pactole et les hits, bastos pour la frime que je mets un gilet pare-balle
peur de me faire allumer dans la rue

Dédié au friqué qui pense au pauvre 
Et au pauvre solidaire que la misère aurait pu diviser 
Unis dans la merde unis dans la richesse unis dans nos différences de teint, de classe sociale 
Le tout est de respecter son prochain aveuglé par le matos
on se marche dessus nargué par Lucifère le malin 
On reste les mêmes, survêt Lacoste et Air Max, de temps en temps une veste en cuir pour briller 
On soigne notre langage pour pas se faire remarquer a la télé 
Jeune ambitieux qui veut s’en sortir 
Tous les moyens sont bons sauf les mauvais 
Un vrai, s’éloigner du faux, tous frères malgré la différence de peau 
La vérité n’a pas d’étendard, ni de drapeau certains se repositionnent et d’autres s’égarent 
Pour se réveiller il sera jamais trop tard 
Et si j’échoue c’est juste que j’ai eu tort d’avoir eu raison trop tôt,

L'Algérino,"Je m'appelle Abdel Krim, j'habite à Alger, là-bas la blanche s'assombrit
Et tout a son prix, exorbitant tous les jours je prie
Dieu de me changer de cette vie routinière où tu restes ignare
Chaque jour est un poignard en plein cagnard
Illusion solaire sur la caseba, wallah sur la homa
Mais je sens rien kho je suis comme dans un coma, trop mal
Le chômage et les promesses de ces présidents
Qui ne restent que quelques temps, juste pour ces belles résidences
Yema je t'aime, je veux faire de toi une poupée Barbie
Marre de tenir ses potos à des heures tardives
La zone pétrolière attaque, brasse des millions
Pendant que le peuple reçoit des coûts de matraque par milliers
C'est la loi du taillon, j'suis diplômé, bac +6
Mais ici y a qu'des débouchés dans l'armée, ou dans la police
L'Algérie c'est un pays d'avenir, mais vois ce qu'a fait de nous l'armée
Un peuple islamique armée né pour mourir précocement
Méhlich tous doucement, je vais faire de toi une princesse
Que dieu exauce mon vœux, je connais un pays qui s'appelle la France
Il paraît qu'il respecte les droits de l'homme
J'pars pour t'élever sur un trône

Yema, je vais faire de toi une princesse
Je vais faire de toi une femme étincelante et pince moi si je rêve trop
Yema, je pars, je laisse mon cœur, mon corps part
Mais ma conscience demeure, j'ai espoir pour demain
Yema, embrasse mes frères et mes sœurs de ma part
Dis leurs que je pars mais que je reviendrai riche
Et que je les sortirai de cette friche
Embrasse papa, merci pour la bonté que je sens en toi
Pardon pour les soucis que je sème en toi

Je prends mes jambes à mon cou
J'embarque clandestinement dans un cargo
Je me sens libre comme un pays qui sort d'un embargo
Les larmes ruissellent le long de mes paupières
Pour aller s'écraser sur le sol poussiéreux
A mesure que je quitte mes terres
J'ai quelques fringues et les cigarettes que m'a passé ami hacli
En attendant un miracle éclot j'en allume une
Éclate mes souvenirs en cette pleine lune
Ma mère hante mes pensées, la mer chante mes pensées
Tant de souvenirs à relater, bons et mauvais
Mais garde le sourire même avec cette mauvaise mine en ce mois de Mai
Je me vois à Marseille faire mes affaires, satisfaire ma famille
Fort de mon vécu, je ferai l'effort de faire des écus
Je me réfugie dans un bateau de sauvetage
Et j'entends qu'un passager clandestin est mort de froid dans une cale
Des frissons dans le dos, mais le courage j'ai
J'ai, dit à ma mère que j'avais des projets

Yema, je vais faire de toi une princesse
Je vais faire de toi une femme étincelante et pince moi si je rêve trop

Embrasse papa, merci pour la bonté que je sens en toi
Pardon pour les soucis que je sème en toi

J'observe le soleil se lever, j'ai quitté le pays du soleil couchant
Je me retrouve dans ce pays représentant l'occident
C'est donc ça ? Le pays où y'a du boulot
Le pays où rare sont les gens au bout du rouleau
On débarque sur les ports de la Joliette
Atmosphère musicale, chant des vagues et chant des mouettes
Je souhaite faire ma vie ici a dire
Ici la vie était d'or, c'est ce que j'ai entendu dire dehors
C'est vrai le soleil est radieux
Hamdoulilah je débarque saint et sauf et ce grâce à dieu
J'évite les douaniers et la police, m'introduit dans la ville phocéenne
Une envie de croquer monte soudaine
Mais quelque chose m'intrigue, on me regarde bizarrement
Quand je parle on se moque de mon accent
Et c'est quelque part un peu vexant
J'aperçois un de mes semblables en sanglot
J'ai compris que la vie en France était loin de ce que j'imaginais la haut

Yema, je vais faire de toi une princesse
Je vais faire de toi une femme étincelante et pince moi si je rêve trop
Yema, je pars, je laisse mon cœur, mon corps part
Mais ma conscience demeure, j'ai espoir pour demain
Yema, embrasse mes frères et mes sœurs de ma part

L'Algérino,"J'reste froid, de marbre, gilet pare-balles
j'entends un cri, c'est rien ce n'est qu'le mal
chacun sa merde j'vais pas changer le monde
sourd, aveugle, muet c'est l'homme 

J'ai trop voulu être franc, mais la plupart des gens sont malentendants
trop de vérités, poussent à être sourd
le coeur palpitant mais rien ne répond
non, personne ne répond, dehors y’a personne
retentissent des cris s'évadant, tout le monde se voit
tout, le monde s'entend, mais tout le monde est sourd et muet
la loi d'l'aveugle d'antan, hypocrisie, chacun pour soi
Dieu pour tout l'monde, tu connais l'dicton
tu connais la loi, une femme violée crie, on en entend que les gémissements
c'est rien, ça lui passera c'est c'qu'on se dit
putain si c'était ta fille, tu buterais père et mère
t'ouvrirais tes oreilles ce ne seront plus des cris tacites
à force de regarder on ne voit plus
comprends la douleur des gens trop de cris mais personne ne les entend

chacun sa merde j'vais pas changer le monde
sourd, aveugle, muet c'est l'homme

Douleur intérieure, on remet tout sur nous même
on aimerait une oreille extérieure pour évacuer c’qui nous fait mal
peur d'l'incompréhension, on parle peu et ça implose à l'intérieur
la plus tragique des hémorragies
un môme de 13 ans porte le poids de 7 ans d'attouchements
il attend un signe mais personne ne l'entend
il se retrouve seul lui et lui et l'image de son ravisseur
dans la conscience trop de poids dur à porter et nous sommes là statiques
ce môme ne fait qu'une victime de plus de pédophilie dans les statistiques
rien nous touche si ça ne touche pas nos familles
égoïste dans l'âme témoin muet quel drame!
Cœur glacé notre souci c'est le compte en banque, l'amour n'a plus la côte ici
planqué à l'abri des cris, j'décris c'que j'vois tant qu'je suis pas aveugle
ma pierre à l'édifice et j'nargue toutes ces comédies

J'reste froid, de marbre, gilet pare-balles
j'entends un cri, c'est rien ce n'est qu'le mal
chacun sa merde j'vais pas changer le monde

chacun sa merde j'vais pas changer le monde
sourd, aveugle, muet c'est l'homme

Et si c'que j'dis choque c'est la triste réalité
dans ce monde chaque jour des hommes se font décapiter
l'oreille faut la tendre, la main faut la tendre, j'fais pas la morale
le premier concerné c'est moi, à force de regarder on ne voit plus
la loi d'l'aveugle est roi chez moi on à tous une mauvaise vue
ouvre les yeux on est ici pour quelque chose, ma cause
s'donner à fond sans compter, décharger ma prose

L'Algérino,"La rue je la vénère pas
Elle m'a causé plus de tort que de bien mais j'l'aime quand même
Car j'oublie pas d'où je viens
Je représente les voyous au grand cœur et les gens biens Chacun ses défauts
J'regarde que les qualités de mes frangins
Dédié à ceux qui m'apprécient
À ceux qui me détestent
Dieu m'éprouve et me teste
J'suis un homme et j'encaisse
Je m'fais un plaisir de chanter pour ceux qui m'aime fort
Les traîtres je les baise ce qui ne tue pas rend plus fort
J'parle la vrai rue les p'tits qu'ont rien à rayave
Les smicards dépressifs et les darons qui prient dans les caves
Monte le son dans le poste
Si ça te touche c'est que tu as du cœur, on a tous les mêmes galères, les mêmes épreuves
Moi j'fais ça avec le cœur sans négliger mon disque
Pour les frères sont dans les ténèbres et partout le vice
Tournent les sœurs dans le tourment recherche le prince charmant
Victimes de leur faiblesse certaines finissent dans des tournantes
Les mains sales comme Le Rat on va se les laver
Les frontières qui nous séparent du bien on va les braver
Les taver, écule des clichés qu'on va bouleverser
Seul mon père j'y crois fort dis-moi si je suis en train de rêver

C'est le chant de ceux qui lèvent la tête ceux qu'on oublie trop vite
Qui ont des rêves et qui attendent pas qu'on tende la perche
Ceux qui s'accrochent à l'espoir malgré les tourments
Ceux qui gardent le moral et qui guettent le bonheur au tournant
Pour toutes les femmes seules qui élèvent leurs gosses avec courage
Et ceux qui restent fort enfermés dans une cage
C'est le chant des braves
On verra le soleil après l'orage

Rien à foutre de c'que les gens diront
Quand j'étais seul y'avait personne à part mon sang
J'ai puisé la force chez les miens
Mes faiblesses, j'les ai puisé chez les autres
À m'attacher bêtement à des putes qui ne valent pas grand-chose
Prend pas cette rage pour de la haine j'ai d'l'amour à vendre
Des amis et des frères à aimer
Des ennemis à pendre
J'ai gaspillé d'l'amour à le donner à n'importe qui
Gaspiller d'l'amitié parce qu'en fait j'savais pas quiller
Ma voix dans les baffes, j'décompresse un max
Comment faire confiance aux gens, ils t'baisent pour une paire d'Air Max
Nos pas ont pas de paix
Je mène ma guerre pour le baise
L'amour s'achète cher les putes en vitrines à Bucarest
L'autre trace des liasses et je fais la sieste
Il serait temps que je me bouge que j'aille à la conquête des cents
Ils veulent tuer mes rêves mais ils savent pas la rage qui m'habite
Si la misère me drague ouais je lui sortirai ma bite
Les grosses liasses, tout ça me fascine
Mon penchant pour ceux qui brillent fait de moi une proie facile
Lève ton verre à ma santé
Je m'régale à chanter ma vie de merde qui n'intéresse que les clebs
Je rêve de lingots d'or
On a cru à l'or
Mais la merde dans les yeux je m'suis réveillé à l'aube
Ils veulent que je plaise aux mômes j'suis pas là pour vendre du rêve mon pote
Encore moins pour vendre aux pauvres

C'est le chant de ceux qui lèvent la tête ceux qu'on oublie trop vite
Qui ont des rêves et qui attendent pas qu'on tende la perche
Ceux qui s'accrochent à l'espoir malgré les tourments
Ceux qui gardent le moral et qui guettent le bonheur au tournant
Pour toutes les femmes seules qui élèvent leurs gosses avec courage
Et ceux qui restent fort enfermés dans une cage
C'est le chant des braves

Je passe la première et j'avance
J'prend l'autoroute de la vie à pleine vitesseet je pence
J'sais pas ou sa me menera une chose et sure jprend le volant
Attendant l'heure ou mon âme s'envolera
J'aperçoit un auto-stoppeur , c'est une femme
Je m’arrête sur la bande d'arrêt d'urgence et je me calme
""Que fait, tu la toute seule? Qui tu es? Ou tu vas?""
Chez pas pourquoi je m’arrête je ressens un truc au fond de moi
Elle me répond: ""Moi je suis ta femme celle qui te cherira toute ta vie
Ensemble on va construire un empire
Je te doit le respect comme toi tu me le dois
On va fondé un foyer fait moi confiance tu verras!""
Vas y grimpe, et je continu mon chemin je sais pas y a quelque chose qui a
Changé, je me sens bien prêt a croquer la vie a pleine dents
Derrière chaque grand homme se cache une femme peut-être aice la mère de mes enfants
Jroule et j'aperçoit des gosses au loin
Leur visage me rapel quelqu'un
Je ralentie, je m'arrête
Peut-être qui ont besoin d'aide: ""qui vous-êtes?""
""Nous ont est tes enfants, ta déssendance, tes dignes héritiers, ta fierté ont est ton sang, prend nous dans tes bras
Serre nous contre toi, ont dit que la vie et dure on ve faire de la route avec toi! ""
""Allez-y grimper mes ptits et mettez votre ceinture le ch'min est parsemé d'embuches c'est vrai que la vie et dure

Votre mère vous couvera son amour sera une toitûre! ""
Plus j'avance plus j'ai l'impression de prendre de l'âge
Jm'arrête a chaque péage
Des rides sur mon visage j'ai une Femme et deux gosses dans la ture
Des panneaux apparaissent et mfont signes de ralentirs,j'lève le pied de l'accelérateur
Jle fait surtout quand je vois le reflet de mes gosses sur le rétro-viseur intérieur 
Faut que jl'ai assumes,que je subvienne a leur besoin
Bon dieu j'ai besoin d'aide faite qu'il ne manque de rien

J'allume une clope et un signal clignote sur le tableau de bord
J'ai presque plus d'essence
Il me reste peut d'argent
Il faut du carburant
Il y a une station à quelque bornes
J'prend le voie de ralentissement
Je déccélère j'freine doucement
Vu que la chaussée est glissante
J'arrive a la station j'met le plein de carburant
Jm'aprête a monter dans mon break
Quand un gars pose sa main sur mon épaule et me dit : "" attend ""
Veut que j'lui accorde un instant
Il etait sapper classe, costard cravate
Attacher caisse , le regard traversant ses lunettes noires, il me dit : "" moi je suis le tollard, en simple j'suis toute les richesses que se bas-monde comporte,tous ce que je touche devient de l'or tu n'auras plus de soucis d'argent,tu railloneras au zenith comme un diamant
Regarde toi, t'en a pas marre de cette vie ?

L'humeur et joviale, tout le monde et souriant
Mais bisarement, je s'stress et j'm'enerve bêtement,jm'enbrouille avec ma femme,ce type à l'air ravi..
A cet instant précis j'ai compris qu'il me manquer un truk dans ma vie
La route s'assombri
Mon regard se noircis
Un nuage noir au-dessus d'ma tête
J'enchaine les cigarettes
Enfet j'suis à coté du diable
Et je le sais même pas
J'vois son regard bisar
Quand une lumière apparait la-bàs
J'me dirige vers cette lueur
Il me dit change de chemin 
Mais jm'accroche au volan fermement avec mes deux mains
Un vieil homme vêtu de blanc se tient sous cette lueur
Jm'arrête curieux dsavoir qui dégage tant de lumière..
Et la je sors de la voiture, jme rapproche du vieil homme et d'un thon calme et rassurant il me dit
""J'suis les principes et les valeurs, sache que le matériel ne contribu jamais au bonheur
Ce type qui se tient à coter de toi est faux et mal-saint, il causera ta perte, il t'égarera en chemin
Moi je conseil le bien et je deconseille le mal, je sens que ton coeur et tacher, que ton âme va mal
On m'appel aussi la foie celle qui calme t'est freyeurs je n'ai pas
D'argent à t'offrir, juste la tranquilité du coeur..""
""C'est bien beau ce que tu racontes mais j'ai
Tout ceux dont j'ai besoin, une femme, des gosses et de l'argent,en gros je manque de rien
T'a l'air d'être quelqu'un de bon mais y'a plus de place dans la tire
J'reviendrais peut-être te chercher mais la je dois partir""
J'remonte dans la caisse avec un semblant de regret
J'accélère, j'accélère
J'suis de plus en plus stresser
J'accélère, j'accélère
Et un coloss me barre la route, je l'évite de justesse
Mais je perd le contrôle de ma caisse
Merde je frappe contre la rembarde de sécurité
Ma tête brise le pare-brise, j'ai le visage ensanglanter
J'entend les sanglots de ma femme et de mes mômes, assomer jsor de la voiture,mais qui est cette homme?
""Moi je suis l'ange de la mort, je suis venu récupérer ton âme
Si ta le vieil homme avec toi, je t'ouvre les portes du paradis, sinon c'est l'enfer
Tu t'es accroché aux choses éphémères et matériels de ce bas-monde

J'sais pas ou sa me menera une chose et sure jprend le volant
Attendant l'heure ou mon âme s'envolera
J'aperçoit un auto-stoppeur , c'est une femme
Je m’arrête sur la bande d'arrêt d'urgence et je me calme
""Que fait, tu la toute seule? Qui tu es? Ou tu vas?""
Chez pas pourquoi je m’arrête je ressens un truc au fond de moi
Elle me répond: ""Moi je suis ta femme celle qui te cherira toute ta vie
Ensemble on va construire un empire
Je te doit le respect comme toi tu me le dois
On va fondé un foyer fait moi confiance tu verras!""
Vas y grimpe, et je continu mon chemin je sais pas y a quelque chose qui a
Changé, je me sens bien prêt a croquer la vie a pleine dents
Derrière chaque grand homme se cache une femme peut-être aice la mère de mes enfants
Jroule et j'aperçoit des gosses au loin

Je ralentie, je m'arrête
Peut-être qui ont besoin d'aide: ""qui vous-êtes?""

J'allume une clope et un signal clignote sur le tableau de bord
J'ai presque plus d'essence
Il me reste peut d'argent
Il faut du carburant
Il y a une station à quelque bornes
J'prend le voie de ralentissement
Je déccélère j'freine doucement
Vu que la chaussée est glissante
J'arrive a la station j'met le plein de carburant
Jm'aprête a monter dans mon break
Quand un gars pose sa main sur mon épaule et me dit : "" attend ""
Veut que j'lui accorde un instant
Il etait sapper classe, costard cravate
Attacher caisse , le regard traversant ses lunettes noires, il me dit : "" moi je suis le tollard, en simple j'suis toute les richesses que se bas-monde comporte,tous ce que je touche devient de l'or tu n'auras plus de soucis d'argent,tu railloneras au zenith comme un diamant
Regarde toi, t'en a pas marre de cette vie ?

J'hésite un peu mais j'ai pas d'autres choix

Mon alliance en argent s'transforme en or 
Ce type avait raison, l'argent contribu au bonheur
L'humeur et joviale, tout le monde et souriant
Mais bisarement, je s'stress et j'm'enerve bêtement,jm'enbrouille avec ma femme,ce type à l'air ravi..
A cet instant précis j'ai compris qu'il me manquer un truk dans ma vie
La route s'assombri
Mon regard se noircis
Un nuage noir au-dessus d'ma tête
J'enchaine les cigarettes
Enfet j'suis à coté du diable
Et je le sais même pas
J'vois son regard bisar
Quand une lumière apparait la-bàs
J'me dirige vers cette lueur
Il me dit change de chemin 
Mais jm'accroche au volan fermement avec mes deux mains
Un vieil homme vêtu de blanc se tient sous cette lueur
Jm'arrête curieux dsavoir qui dégage tant de lumière..
Et la je sors de la voiture, jme rapproche du vieil homme et d'un thon calme et rassurant il me dit
""J'suis les principes et les valeurs, sache que le matériel ne contribu jamais au bonheur
Ce type qui se tient à coter de toi est faux et mal-saint, il causera ta perte, il t'égarera en chemin
Moi je conseil le bien et je deconseille le mal, je sens que ton coeur et tacher, que ton âme va mal
On m'appel aussi la foie celle qui calme t'est freyeurs je n'ai pas
D'argent à t'offrir, juste la tranquilité du coeur..""
""C'est bien beau ce que tu racontes mais j'ai

T'a l'air d'être quelqu'un de bon mais y'a plus de place dans la tire
J'reviendrais peut-être te chercher mais la je dois partir""
J'remonte dans la caisse avec un semblant de regret
J'accélère, j'accélère
J'suis de plus en plus stresser
J'accélère, j'accélère
Et un coloss me barre la route, je l'évite de justesse
Mais je perd le contrôle de ma caisse
Merde je frappe contre la rembarde de sécurité

L'Âme Immortelle,"ItÂ´s time to leave the stage
In this theatre of pain
To let go of all the rage
When all scenes have been played

The final act concluded
The curtain falls for one last time
And outside the crowed still cheers
There'll be no encore this time

Weep away all your tears my friend
We will meet again someday
But this time, there'll be an end
To this play I called my life

Leaving the stage, smash the mask
An actor dead, a human being
On the ground, a final gasp

Outsied is conquered silently
By a soul who's free of pain

And leave nothing behind
Too many live just for the day
And let their time pass by

Too many pictures frameless
Blurred lost memories

Do not search this place for me 
Search for me deep in your heart 
If I haven't built my memorial there 
My life has been in vain

So I must not fear the time 
When the reaper shows its face 
My memorial will shine 
Brighter than the sun 

Let come the night, the final day 
To retreat forever

I have never wanted more

Please forgive me, but I have to leave
Stand up proud and show no grief
In this hour, I will pray
That we'll be joined again some day
Our love is stronger than the sun
And will still shine, when I am gone
I'm so afraid to cross this line

For smashing crowns that I have earned

New possibilities each day
They offer me a different way
To live, to walk or just to be
Or lead me into misery

I am just as small as you
Although I do not want me to

In our small cascades

Into my own reality

Where we can roam eternally

Nothing holds us back tonight

A broken soul, the paper torn

Letters that once made up words
Don`t have a meaning anymore
Carried away by nighttime birds
A blank page left to die

The songs I wrote fade with the wind
As the wheel of ages turns
The muses once upon me grinned
But now they speak no more

Notes that made up melodies
Distort into disharmony
Like a ghost that swiftly flees
And vanishes as daybreak comes",Disharmony
L'Arc-en-Ciel,"""flowers are blooming, flowers of many colours""
If you dream, please, ''cause I'm fainting
""let's make it raining without an end""
But even you after all, when we die we'll be together
Hungry wolves create false love
""come on believe in me""
The unending blaze advances
Awakening too late means ""goodbye""
""let's all bring peaceful love"" ,isn't this words so strange ?
It can't be helped so there's no more future
Fictive story is, yes, truly a wonderful reality
If it is so, immediately, let's go to Mars
The history is a clear profile of strife, so
""come on believe in miracle""
Wishes were reduced into ashes
In this world of endless ruin, to whom you'll devote yourself?
DEVIL's walk in the strawberry fields
The freshly squeezed tears, please eat 'em
""aren't they tasted like honey ?""

L'Arc-en-Ciel,"This clear drop is you, the lovely sound of water
A glissening swaying ripple is the premonition of spring; an awakening spell

Beyond the wall, it was piled up and crumbled
Softly, that day I laughed at it

Strange isn't it, the time, rusted and stopped
Informs even this world of the morning

So I try to stare at it without closing my eyes
If the white snow flower that blossomed in midwinter comes now, I should notice it

The tangled clouds overhead are tearing
The frozen earth quietly changed color
The flapping wings of birds, the singing voice of the people
Start to echo, and my heart burns
And with a gentle smile on the sunken landscape under the eternal sky
The wind blows that you were here

If I top up the broken rail with paint
A clear tomorrow will have come

Life, strange isn't it, is the time, rusted and stopped
That informs even this world of the morning
We walk in the warm snow that poured down
It seems like a blessing, la la lu la la, la la lu la la, la la lu la la

One day I want to show you when
The means for conflict disappear, in the clear days

People won't stop hurting one another in this degenerating world
But since meeting you, I have nothing to fear anymore

L'Ensemble de Cuivres Valaisan,"As down the glen one easter morn to a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men in squadrons passed me by
No pipes did hum no bottle drum, did sounds its loud tatoo
But the Angelus bell o'er the Lifey swell rang out in the foggy dew

Right proudly high in Dublin town they flung out the flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud El Bar
Anf from the plains of Foyal Meath strong men came hurrying through
While Britannia's huns with their great big guns sailed in through the foggy dew

O the night fell black, the rifles crack made ""Perfidious Albion"" real
'Mid the leaden rail, seven tongues of flame did shine O'er the lines of steel
By each shining blade a prayer was said that to Ireland her sons be true
And when morning broke still the war flag shook out its fold in the foggy dew

'Twas England bade our wild Geese go that small nations might be free
But teir lonely graves are by Suvla's waves or the fringe of the great North Sea
O had they died by Pearse's side or had fought with Cathal Brugha
Their names we'd deep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the shroud of the foggy dew.

But the bravest fell and the requiem bell rang mournfully dand clear,
For those who died that watertide in the springtime of the year
While the world did gaze, with deep amaze, at those fearless men but few
Who bore the fight that Freedom's light might shine through the foggy dew.

Ah back to the glen I rode again and my heart with grief was sore dead when you fell in the foggy dew.
For I parted then with valiant men whom I never shall see more
But to and fro in my dreams I go and I'd kneel and pry for you
For slavery fled O glorious

Et y’en a qui t’cachent des choses, et ouais, pour pas te faire mal
Trop d’acteurs, de squatteurs, de bâtards, de gratteurs de biff
Faut des valeurs, le malheur t’arrache la peur de vivre

On avance dans l’Rap avec méfiance car trop sont tricards
En masque depuis la naissance pour mieux rêver d’une vie d’star
Les gens sont tous les mêmes, bébé, ne danse plus
Moi, c’est la transe que j’aime, qui me maintient en stud'

Ils vont boire la tasse car il faudra nager pour percer
Ma carapace, j’arrive au bal masqué armé
De mes paragraphes, là, gars, j’pars à la base, j’kiffais pas la bagarre
Mais t’as pas l’choix à Paname, t’as la poisse si t’es pas à la page
Rien à foutre, j’marche à visage découvert
Et j’me ferais ta fille pendant que ta femme videra mes poubelles
T’as dit voir une explosion mais c’était qu’une flamme
Toi, ton masque de fer qu’tu t’es fait greffé dans le crâne
Ça fait partie du décor comme du rouge à lèvres sur une bouche pulpeuse
Et si un jour j’pue l’buzz, j'habitue mes proches
Car la canicule est proche, remballe ton blablabla contractuel
Ton attitude est moche, c’est une mascarade, on m’a dupé

Quelques gouttes de sueur, lueur au fond des yeux
Une humeur de tueuse si des gus sont des désireux
À peine rentrée dans la soirée, hop, elle voulait vite prendre l’air
Elle en a déjà marre de refouler tous les types bourrés qui s’emmerdent
Elle a des cernes, la coke dans le sac, leggings troué, string panthère
Elle a laissé la mode prendre le pas sur ses goûts vestimentaires
Elle ne pense qu’à s’amuser, elle a sa classe naturelle
Elle a son bal masqué?
Et moi, j’suis seul à la mater comme un goujat
Mais, lassée par la foule, là, elle fout l’camp et me fout l’cafard
Donc j’regarde les poufs?
Il s’prend pour un fêtard, j’suis juste un trou d’balle masqué

On avance dans l’Rap avec méfiance car trop sont tricards

Y'a que dans l'ombre qu'on tranche pour pas finir aux assises
Souvent dans un camouflage vert kaki
L'ambiance est pourave, y'a des? ça vi-ser d'la weed
Ici, tu perds ta vie, on t'nique ta mère à 6
Une bonne paire de Nike Air dans la tête, c'est facile
Le ? est entouré donc on fait ça à notre manière
Bientôt le L est en tournée donc prenez garde à vos arrières
Bitch, et toi, dis moi pourquoi tu causes
On est au festival de Cannes, toi, tu traînes à la Foire du Trône

A l'inverse de la langue française, je n'tolère pas de faux amis
Quand j'entre en scène, j'fais de gros dégâts donc aux abris
Les vrais me reconnaissent
Les autres reconnaissent de beaux habits
Rap, style, magie, c'est l'heure de l'appel des?
Igo la faute à qui si on parie gros la nuit
Un jour un parigot m'a dit, «Ici, on salit trop la vie»
Plus tard, j'ai pu l'voir, on t'crache dessus quand tu perds
On te suce la bite quand tu gagnes
Un billet pour le bagne, telles des disques rayés
Ici les amitiés tournent mal pour le cash
J'crée des chansons, inspiré par le gros shit

On partouze avec des trentenaires mleh, vie de trader
Un verre de jagger et nos coups d'haleine te transpercent
Ça vient du bled ou bien des bas-fonds de la jungle urbaine
Tiens-tu tête, face à l'escadron, tu n'as rien pu faire
Des insurgés qui foncent tête basse quand ça s'bat
On aime pas quand ça parle, grosse baffe dans ta face
Technique KGB, bébé, pour caresser ta carte CB
Faut pas rêver, ?, tu vas apprécier d'être à mes pieds
Y'a des sous à s'faire, la plupart des filles sont séduites par le mal
Fous la merde comme Samy Naceri au Festival de Cannes

Fous la merde dans ta? qui casse des gueules
Comme des keums qui regardent mal
Saleté d'? éclate des keufs et fous la merde
Vas-y, vas-y, vas-y, fous la merde!

Qui te couchent et t'mettent des coups par terre

Tu veux boire un bon coup, j'ai d'la frappe vodka-pêche
Hey, fais pas la belle, j'ai d'autres chattes à fouetter, la miss
Donc c'est pas la peine d'être là à souhaiter que je t'admire
Appelle les keufs, on verra bien c'qui s'passera

L'Entourage,"On est dans l'feu de l'action, testerait bien plein de trucs
Ils ont comme seule passion d'péter un joint d'pure
Mise sur moi, j'te l'rends au quintuple
Pour l'instant, je serre les dents pour éviter d'serrer la ceinture
Ma team me guide de près, j'habite le XIXème
Naïf j'étais jadis, j'ai déjà dit ""Je t'aime""
Désormais, désolé, j'veux de grandes sommes, que les dollars pleuvent
Devenir des Richard Branson ou des Donald Trump
Tous mes zonards gueulent qu'ils veulent de l'oseille (tous)
Mais ne foutent rien et ont peur de leurs problèmes
Jeune poète finira dans un rêve
Ou 'vec une balle dans la tête comme Kurt Cobain
Ils disent qu'il est temps que j'arrête, je m'en tape
Laisse-moi lire mes mangas, rester gosse jusqu'à trente balais
Si t'abandonnes, y'aura jamais personne pour t'ramener
Mais si tu crois en toi alors tu peux monter une armée

C'est pour ma ville, mon équipe et mes fréquentations
Si tu n'fais pas de transaction, évite de taper dans ma cons'
Ce n'sont pas des grands garçons, ils font que parler sans actions
Tu pourras m'suivre sur Twitter mais jamais dans ma tombe
Et si j'veux quitter ce monde, ce sera jamais sans la richesse
Malgré mon teint basané qui m'a aggravé l'fasciès (Yes)
J'veux passer mon temps à errer dans Paris Est
C'était souvent un gros bang qui précédait ma sieste
A chaque soirée une nouvelle embrouille, la vie nous laisse dans l'doute
Même si t'es dans l'move, c'est chiant de vivre tous ses rêves en boucle
Les coups durs arrivent quand j'commence à apprécier la vie
A quoi bon s'marier (Quoi)
Voir ta femme chez des amis et dire ""Fais tes valises""
Non, moi, j'préfère poser des rimes fédératrices
J'ai v'là les textes coffrés, j'estime que j'ai de l'avenir
Et à long terme, être libre c'est ça qu'on aime (Ouais)

Je dois m'jeter à l'eau mais j'redoute chaque cap
24 ans et déjà K.O. Mais j'veux sauver ma peau
Donc si les disques se vendent, laisse-moi vivre ce rêve
Pour l'instant, j'suis bloqué à 19 ans dans Paris XIXème
J'observe Paname la night, ça accapare d'la maille
C'est grave, même le Dalaï Lama fait du Krav-maga
(Ouais) Ici, on vit à l'improviste, mec
J'ai tenté l'impossible et j'ai compris que c'était impossible
Marre d'cette vie morose, on croit que l'argent fait l'bonheur
S'trompe de combat comme des boxeurs en kimono
Moi, j'suis ce parigot qui cogne le micro
Pisse sur la croix celtique, demande du respect comme Alliance Ethnik
Cette vie nous rend sceptique donc on l'ironise fort
Comme dans le club des Hendrix et Jim Morrison's

J'irais braquer, ramener des sacs de liasses pour être bien
Putain, fais couler le bain
Que je réfléchisse à c'que j'ferais au cas où j'mourrais demain
L'amour où la haine, le vice ou la vertu
La faucheuse t'empêchera d'louper le train

J'viens pas jouer l'devin mais je mourrais demain

J'dirais à mes zins, pour moi, d'embrasser leurs familles
J'irais à 'Dam, pèch' du shit de la meilleurs qualit'
J'lancerais un appel sur Twitter pour me faire masser l'dos
J'irais au resto en claquettes claquer un paquet d'love
J'dirais à mon ex que j'la kiffais vraiment
J'viderais dans un rap mon sac et toutes mes idées démentes
J'ferais péter une paire de sneak à 400 boules
Rigolant à l'idée que je l'ai porterai pas dans l'trou
J'dirais à mon frère d'aller au bout d'ses rêves
Un je t'aime à mon père, timide, du bout d'mes lèvres
J'écrirais une lettre d'amour où j'parle d'avenir
Pour ma mère et la sienne, les deux femmes de ma vie

Je voudrais une vag' mobile, des grosses armes et des rêves d'idiot
Un 4x4 avec un soda sous l'soleil d'Rio
Un tas d'cash ? tour du monde
J'veux des meufs douces qui m'pompent
Mon cohiba est splendidos (C'est ça)
Laisser un bon souvenir à ma mère, moi, j'aurais conquis la planète
Là, j'baiserais une dernière pute et j'jeterais mon pénis à la mer
J'embrasserais ma mif pour une dernière fois, je laisserais derrière moi
Un bel avenir, mes amis et ma 'teille de Sky
J'veux pas d'une image de vermine, ma petite life s'éternise
Et tous ceux qui comptaient sur moi enfin, j'les prendrais dans mes bras
Avant de tomber dans cette boite et qu'mon cigare se termine

J'penserais qu'à damer mes plats d'la baraque
Voir l'Amérique mais j'crois que c'est cuit, j'aurais qu'une life banale
J'me serais fait des stars et des femmes flics
J'aurais incrusté les stades pour faire des dingueries
Passer ma soirée avec mes proches
Se raconter des choses drôles de l'époque
Avouer toutes mes entourloupes, j'mens toujours
Ter-ma mon film préféré avant que j'rentre dans l'goufre
Mais j'ai eu du bol dans ma vie
J'rêve d'une mort entouré par ma famille

Si je mourrais demain, j'ferais la même chose qu'hier
Allumerais un petit stick suivi d'une grosse bière
Posé dans le coin d'rue, rigolant de la vie
Exposant mon point d'vue puis m'isolant dans la nuit
Rejoignant mon abri, embrassant la solitude
Assis, réfléchissant, pensant à mon avenir
Demain, j'serai dans l'brouillard, serais-je avec Marcelo
Et les autres ou plongé dans un grand trou noir?
J'aimerais qu'ça danse tout-par
Derrière mon corps frigide posé entre quatre planches en bois
J'te laisserais m'emporter

Une belle paire de fesses pour me divertir
J'suis à propos de ce sex-appeal
Un jour je les aime un jour je les jette je suis versatile
Et si Maman me voyait
Claquer dans des sappes un montant de loyer, je serais renvoyé

Hier j'étais saoul, c'est limite si je rampais
La tise m'empêche de me noyer mais si mon grand-père me voyait
Lui tout ce qu'il veut c'est voir ses petits-fils vivre en paix
Et quand j'me fait cramer j'rectifie le tir d'emblée
Mes parents ne voient que la partie émergée de l'iceberg
On me parlait de blasphème quand j'émiettais de la zeb
J'ai merdé je l'admets mais c'est pas ce que ma mère croit
J'préfère mentir plutôt que de la décevoir

Si mes parents voyaient, à quoi je m'employais

Tard le soir, tôt le matin, côtoie les extrêmes
Donc souvent j'vous mens quand j'dis que j'vous mens pas

Elle doit se questionner nuit et jour
Comment j'fais pour graille, où j'dors et avec qui
Mais laisse tomber j'fuis ses coups d'fils et ça déteint
Sur son moral, c'est dommage, le cool-al et les coups d'vices ça m'plaît bien
C'est ma vie de galérien
J'lui fais croire que j'suis à l'hôtel en vrai j'dors sur un parking aérien

S'ils m'avaient vu perdu dans la rue j'aurai ressenti leur peur
Si j'avais acheté puis revendu j'aurai menti dans l'heure
S'ils m'voyaient maltraitant mes sœurs j'goûterais les cris et les coups
Ils m'ont vu sécher deux trois cours, golri sur mes professeurs
S'ils m'avaient vu au parloir j'aurai aperçu des pleurs
S'ils m'avaient vu veine sous rasoir c'est qu'j'aurais fais une erreur

Nigga, it's you better go find your zone
For each it's on I'ma keep it strong
Nigga, I'm never gon' buckle every man for they hustle
Nigga, don't make me show you my muscle, and throw these knuckles
It's a must that I bust any mic or gun that you handed me
And I plan to be that rich little nigga
that's reppin' that Mo Thug family
Can you stand heat? 
If you can't, get your ass outta the kitchen
I'ma blast up out my mission, nigga can't stand all of this trippin'
Time is tickin', it ain't waitin' on none of us (not me)

So, none of y'all fake niggas better not ask me shit
Tryin' to comment on my flashy shit
Hate 'cause i'm on some classy shit 
I'm still down to earth whatever it's worth

Undefeated in the game called life

Ain't worried about seein' the day they die 
Lil' Lay won't lie
I'ma tell the truth, even though the truth can hurt ya
If it don't concern ya better mind your business
It can end in murder 
In the crossfire, another nigga gone
He at the crossroads, his time expired 
Ain't nobody knows why he ran with lost souls
It was bad news
I guess that nigga was walkin' in bad shoes
If cash rules everything around you
Nigga, you's a fool
I'ma stay in the Lord's light
And outta you busta niggas way
Got sick, got gauges in the cage
Ready to spray this ain't no tour fight
In the last days
Where time has elapsed and the world is collapsin'
I'ma continue to smash and steadily blastin' for my satisfaction

Better be lucky this mothafuckin rap pays 
What'cho gonna do when it come for you?

Reason why a mothafucka had to get checked 
Nigga, when I step on the set 
Then i'll be willing to bet 
It's going down in the name of threat 
This isn't a promise 
I'm the bombest mothafuckin' nigga that you gotta compete with

Keep this raw, uncut for the streets shit 
Peep this game from the nigga from Cleveland 
Been around the globe 
Did a few shows, and I fucked a few ho's 
Made a lotta dough, and I'm itchin' for mo' 
So, too many niggas be envious 
want to hate on the nigga with the benjamins 
Tryin' to plot on another nigga dividends 
Though the life we live gets strenuous 
And we gettin' it how me and my niggas 
We outrang hustlas, thug by nature

Gotta keep moving, gotta let go

Till I've seen the world, when I cry
Get in my spaceship, watch me fly

Don't need no one to tell me

Left 8:01 from Gate 17
Victims of a war they never knew existed
Hell looked them in the eye
And still they resisted

Lost brave souls your courage we remember
Sacrificed young lives last September
We still hear your battle cry
Are you ready, okay, let's roll
Are you ready, okay, let's roll

So began the massacre at twenty thousand feet
Red devils leap in charge, pulled captain from his seat
They watched them cut and slash, and anyone left standing
We knew deep in our hearts, this plane would not be landing

Never once were they ever in control
Lives were lost, but they never took our soul
We still hear your battle cry
Are you ready, okay, let's roll
Are you ready, okay, let's roll

Skies of Pennsylvania became a battle ground
Two hundred miles away, the towers had come down
One last chance to say goodbye, he called her on his phone
Said he knew what must be done, ""I am not coming home.""

L.V.,"Once upon a time a good friend of mine
Told me to tell y'all what I say today
Do the things that keep a smile on her face
Say the words that make her feel better ev'ry day
You bet you better keep on you Ps and Qs
If you don't the woman you can easily lose
Oh, I had a love, a true love and I lost it
No one seems to understand about the pain that it cost me

Woman's got to have it
I believe that I should know
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to make her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
Think it over

Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard
Oh, I had a love, it was a true love and I lost it
Now I'm suffering all this pain that the true love cost me

A woman's got to have it
I believe
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to let her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground

So if you've got a love
And maybe you've got eyes to keep her
You've got to give her what she wants when she wants it
Where she wants it (all right)
How she wants it
And every doggone time she thinks she needs it

Your woman needs it
The same as mine
A woman got to have it
From time to time

Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all

Changing movement into the light

It can come or pass you by
It's push, shove world but there's always a chance
