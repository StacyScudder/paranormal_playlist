AuDen,"J’ai pour horizon d’oublier
Les questions à mes trousses
J’ai pour raison de saboter
Le bon sens de la cause
A chaque lune tout me rappelle
Au combien je me tue
Entre silence et décibels
L’écho résonne et me susurre

Tout n’est que songes et regrets

Je fuis le jour où mes secrets
Se seront dévoilés
Je crains les nuits et le sommeil
Qui souvent séquestrent mes pensées
A chaque lune tout me rappelle
Au combien je me tue
Quand le sillon de mes séquelles
Bordent la plaine de sigue

Je ne suis rien du tout
Je ne fuis rien de plus
J’arrive au terminus
Je suis au bout du tout
Je ne suis rien du tout
Je ne fuis rien de plus
J’arrive au terminus
Je suis au bout du tout

Je suis de ceux qui se souviennent
Des allées et venues
Du temps qui passe et me ramène
L’illusion d’une issue
Du temps mais ceux qu’on ne relaissent
Moi qui n’en avait plus
Puisque la route enfin s’achève
Puisque mes mots sont entendus

Je ne suis rien du tout
Je ne fuis rien de plus
J’arrive au terminus
Je suis au bout du tout
Je ne suis rien du tout
Je ne fuis rien de plus
J’arrive au terminus
Je suis au bout du tout

Je ne suis rien du tout
Je ne fuis rien de plus
J’arrive au terminus
Je ne suis rien 
Je ne suis rien du tout
Je ne fuis rien de plus
J’arrive au terminus
Je suis au bout du tout

Je ne fuis rien du tout
Je ne fuis rien de plus
J’arrive au terminus
Je suis au bout du tout

Je ne suis rien du tout
Je ne fuis rien de plus
J’arrive au terminus
Je suis au bout du tout",Le  bout du tout
AuDen,"La nuit je marche à reculons
Si loin, je ne vois plus le fond
Tout ça pour oublier
Tout ça pour m’oublier
De ces vapeurs naît le poison
Au doux parfum de déraison
Tu t’en vas m’oublier
Je m’en vais m’oublier
Puisque qu’à chacun son élixir
Pour qui désire l’amnésie
S’il faut atteindre l’anesthésie
Je trinque aux folles hérésies

J’oublie mais me rappelle
Quand poussé par l’ivresse
Ailleurs sans doute, combien me coûte
Les portes par lesquelles
De long en large, j’essaie, de trouver le sommeil
A contre-jour, quand mon cœur se plaît à prendre l’air

Et la nuit trouble mes visions
De doux visages sans noms
Que je dois oublier
Qui doivent m’oublier
De certitudes en illusions
Quand tout se prête à confusion
Saurai-je oublier
Si je dois m’oublier
Puisqu’à chacun son élixir
Pour qui désire l’amnésie
S’il faut atteindre l’anesthésie
Je trinque aux folles hérésies

J’oublie mais me rappelle
Quand poussé par l’ivresse
Ailleurs sans doute, combien me coûte
Les portes par lesquelles
De long en large, j’essaie, de trouver le sommeil
A contre-jour, quand mon cœur se plaît à prendre l’air

Le piano bar joue des chansons
Le jour se lève à l’horizon
Demain, ouais, j’aurai tout oublié",Douces vapeurs
AuDen,"Éphémère mais sûr, 
Incertain et fier, 
Je lance mes pierres, 
Des éclats de lune

Des lumières obscures 
Sous les astres éclairent
De nocturnes et de fièvres
Étourdi j'ai vu passer mes rêves

A qui donc sommes-nous
Qui nous a, qui nous mène? 
Qui nous lie aux lanternes solaires?

Laissons, laissons venir 
Laissons venir la fièvre
Laissons, laissons venir,
Laissons venir la fièvre

L'univers est sourd
Des cimes au dessus des mers
Je vis en dessous de l'air 
Parmi les poussières du jour

Le réel est flou, 
Le néant si clair
De nocturnes et de fièvres
Étourdi j'ai vu passer mes rêves
Ou s'égare l'homme fou
vit il encore de sève
Croit il encore au soleil qui se lève?

A qui donc sommes-nous?
Qui nous a, qui nous mène?
Mais qui nous lie aux lanternes solaires?

Laissons, laissons venir 
Laissons venir la fièvre 
Laissons, laissons venir,
Laissons venir la fièvre 

(Laissons, laissons venir 
Laissons venir la fièvre 
Laissons, laissons venir,
Laissons venir la fièvre)",Etourdi
AuDen,"Comme le vent souffle fort
Sur nos esprits ternes
Comme souvent tous nos efforts
Gisent et prennent l’air
Qui sans rage pourrait y échapper
Qui prend le large, tutoie les noyés

Tant que l’on chante sous le décor
De la vie western
Tant que l’on danse sur les accords
De la tristesse même
L’orage nous verra s’éloigner
Bien vivants nous sommeillerons entiers

On peut viser loin, plus loin
Ici ou là je vais
Puisqu’ici-bas je sais
Tenter demain, sûr de rien
Ici ou là je vais
Puisqu’ici-bas je sais

Comme le temps qui s’évapore
Sur nos hémisphères
Sans que le sens nous donne alors
La clé du mystère
Qui s’échine encore à la chercher
Mais qui vit d’espoirs abandonnés

Combien sont-ils
Combien se meurent d’être seuls en scène
Combien sont-ils
Comptant les heures qui manquent à l’appel
Si d’avance nous sommes dépassés
Où va l’homme après son arrivée

On peut viser loin, plus loin
Ici ou là je vais
Puisqu’ici-bas je sais
Tenter demain, sûr de rien
Ici ou là je vais
Puisqu’ici-bas je sais

On peut viser loin, plus loin
Ici ou là je vais
Puisqu’ici-bas je sais
Tenter demain, sûr de rien
Ici ou là je vais
Puisqu’ici-bas je sais

On peut viser loin, plus loin

AuDen,"Et tu prends le large
Et moi, depuis la rive
Je te regarde t’éloigner
Peu à peu, tu te retires
Des terres orageuses
A l’océan silencieux
Il n’est qu’un pas
Qu’on se le dise

Qui d’autre que moi pour crier
Si le brouillard vient effacer
Oh garde toi de m’oublier
Si nos amours perdus
Sont tombés par-dessus bord
Tombés par-dessus bord
Par-dessus
Combien tu m’aimes",Le  large
AuDen,"Les amours mortes sont nées trop vite
A peine élancées qu'elles dérivent
Pour se jeter aux océans

Voyant l'eau trouble et insipide
Noyant le pont qui les nourrit
Pour nous rejeter au néant

Des vagues l'écume ne me laisse
Pour seule épave de nos ivresses
Ce goût amer qu'est le présent

Sans phare et sans feu de détresse
Viennent s'échouer et se délaissent
Nos amours aux sables mouvants
Nos amours aux sables mouvants

Les amours mortes sont nées trop vite
A peine élancées qu'elles dérivent
Les amours mortes sont nées trop vite
A peine élancées qu'elles dérivent

Les amours mortes ont lâché prise
Comme noyées par une eau vive
A la merci de ces méandres

Puis elles chavirent dans l'infini
Avant de sombrer dans l'oubli
Là où personne ne les attend

Pas sûr que mon ombre s'éternise
Pas sûr que l'espoir nous épuise
Parait-il que tournent les vents

Ne dit-on pas que les abysses
Reviennent les amours déesses
Je naviguerai les océans
Je naviguerai les océans

Les amours mortes sont nées trop vite
A peine élancées qu'elles dérivent
Les amours mortes sont nées trop vite
A peine élancées qu'elles dérivent",Les amours mortes
AuDen,"On soupire nos espoirs à pertes de vue,
On s’écrit dans l’histoire des chapitres perdus
On nous vendrait l’enfer pour unique horizon
On nous rendrait l’envers à l’endroit des raisons
On nous prive d’un instant que l’on compte à rebours
On reprend les devants d’un aller sans retour
Le temps de ce mettre au parfum
On refait les printemps

On s’envisage et on s’oublie
On tourne des pages blanches sans prendre le temps d’écrire
Si tous les mots que l’on se dit
On s’envisage et on s’oublie

Quand ivre je vais
Quand libre je viens
Quand vivre revient
A nous suivre que des règles (pas sur !)
Poursuivre des rêves au delà du trop loin
Comprendre aujourd’hui
Comme hier pour demain
Le temps de ce mettre au parfum
On refait les printemps

On s’envisage et on s’oublie
On tourne des pages blanches sans prendre le temps d’écrire
Si tous les mots que l’on se dit
On s’envisage et on s’oublie

Nous sommes l’air de jasmin
L’or entre nos mains
Les plus à leurs portés
Si l’on nous prouve qu’on est en vie
Si l’on nous prouve qu’on est,
On pourrait tout dire

On s’envisage et on s’oublie
On tourne des pages blanches sans prendre le temps d’écrire
Si tous les mots que l’on se dit
On s’envisage et on s’oublie

On s’envisage et on s’oublie

AuDen,"Je vole à ton secours
Tes détresses en tambour
N'ont jamais fait surface
Dans tes yeux de velours
Quand devant moi la grâce
Si légère tu dansais
Tu cadençais tes valses
D'un adieu, jamais

Et l'ombre qui t'entoure est un mystère
Que je ne saurais découvrir
De ton profond coma, de ton enfer

Audible,"Everything is rising again
The things I thought were dead
The past is trying to breath
To tear apart this life

Everything is dying away
Against my dying will
Against my dying cries
The world is turning red

I see no pain
I feel no pain
Until the end
To wake beneath the rain

I know nothing lasts so long
My patience waits
I feel no remorse
I know no pain

Beneath this, beneath this there once was hope
There once was warmth
Just one word, just one prayer is all I need
To save me from myself




",Beneath
Audien,"It's hard to give a damn about the sticks or stones
When all my bones been shook so long
And the ghost inside my head it keeps a floating on
And all night long I pray him gone

Like ooh ooh
Think I've forgotten how to sleep
Oooh ooh
Think I've forgotten how to sleep

Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
'Cause I just wanna stay alive
I'm fighting with the beast inside
Cause I don't wanna close my eyes

Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
'Cause I just wanna stay alive
I'm fighting with the beast inside
And I don't wanna close my eyes

Been dancing in the gallows just to lose myself
I've come undone I need some help
And I'm sick of throwing pennies in the wishing well
Cause everyone goes straight to hell

Like ooh ooh
Think I've forgotten how to sleep
Ooh ooh
Think I've forgotten how to sleep

Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
Cause I just wanna stay alive
I'm fighting with the beast inside
Cause I don't wanna close my eyes

Cause I just wanna stay alive
I'm fighting with the beast inside
Cause I don't wanna close my eyes

If I cross the oceans, would you be there?

A stranger's eyes that somehow look familiar
I know that when it's you, I'll remember
Remember

So wait for me, I swear I'll find you
Climbing every wall that hides you
I know we were meant for something better
So wait for me, the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I were meant for something better
Better, oh

Audience,"The night was plagued by storms
People came in swarms
Trying to keep warm
All to the house of the Overlord

Through the night they came
Came for food and game
The poor, weak, the lame
All to the house of the Overlord

All through the year they would work and they'd sweat
And wait for the time of the year
Wait for the time when the man from the mansion

You cracked your head!

There's hope for all mankind
Just give it to him
And you can't find life more abundantly
And that's the only reason for life!

Audio Adrenaline,"To define revolution just look at the word
Dance around the globe yo haven't you heard
About changes the walls tumble down
And the people rearrange it
They're not satisfied with the state they're in
So they take their world and they give it a spin
They take what's up and they turn it down
A revolution spinning round
Out with the old and in with the new

We try to teach old dogs brand new tricks
And if you're an old dog you best not resist the call
To live a Godly life, yo
Grab a sword because it's like a war
On moral pollution
Bang bang! It's a revolution

Calling for a revolution
Of the body mind and soul
Calling for a revolution
To end the sin and let love flow

Back some years in history
We fought and won the victory
Freedom for the red white and blue
We stood for the church and the Godly truths
But these days its all turned around
A revolutions coming down
'Cause the Lord ain't Lord of the land of the free
It's time to bring the Lord back from history
And right now it comes to you
And you know what you gotta do
A call to arms
Against the ruler of this dark world
He'll try to school ya
Time to drop the bomb on the ugly thing
You got almighty power in Jesus name
To end the war on moral pollution
Bang bang! It's a revolution

Of the body mind and soul
Calling for a revolution

Wrapped in Your majesty

Then they will be brave and free
Shout your name in victory
When we love when we love the least of these
When we love the least of these

Break our hearts once again
Help us to remember when
We were only children hoping for a friend
Won’t you look around these are the lives that the world has forgotten
Waiting for doors of our hearts and our homes to open

Wrapped in Your majesty
When we love, when we love the least of these

If not us tell me who will be like Jesus

Audio Bullys,"Not too long ago in a land called London 
I was feeling low and my life came undone
I didn't even have a penny to my name, 
My minutes in the hours were just floatin' down the drain
So I started to think with the drink in the pub, 
That I could be pursuing other stuff
'Cause I told you take the rough with the smooth, now listen to the groove

Time gets past it, the feeling lasted, 
Music blasted but nothing past its stone, 
Gonna get my own, now we're in the zone
Everything's a mist to me and everything's a mystery
The things in life you wish to be
We're leaving it to history
Better catch this life 'cause its floatin' past, 

We're in the game and we're in to last, 
No one knows when fate gets past, 
If I'm gonna go I'm goin' out with a blast
Gotta sort it out but your shit 
Just turned away, just turned away girl, just turned away
Tryna' sort my problems out from day-to-day,
From day to day girl, from day to day

Then there were the days went no where at all 
But then I started sprayin' on the trains and the walls
Got a girl and my life got better, 
Left a few men feelin 'bit better
So pretty and her eyes were green, 
Felt proud to bring her out on the scene
About a year I was with her for 

And when we broke it left me quite sore
So I clicked my heels and kept walking, 
Seen another that I like, now we're talking
Well if there's a boat to the sun, I tell you every one wants on
If life for you has just begun, there's summer at the end of the run
So when the summer days blaze on, 
Sip a beer and look to the sun and keep it ninety-eight percent fun, 

Be glad when your life times done, one
Gotta sort it out but your shit just turned away, 
Just turned away girl, just turned away
Tryna' sort my problems out from day-to-day, 
From day to day girl, from day to day
Wake up early and my eyes are glazed, 
Reminiscing all them old school days

When I spent every day in a haze, 
Looking out for your loved ones pays
New Era, new serial number,
When I wake from slumber, hear the thunder rumble, 
Don't tumble, Frank's in the jungle
Grey cells automatically tell tails, 
From Ireland to Wales, wind in my sails

Sun on my face and when I'm gone there won't be no trace
Captivate, demonstrate, its about time to castrate
The truth from the fiction, feel the friction burns
As we learn to take turns, now listen to my terms, 
'Cause every single one in the world gotta turn
We're leaving you third degree burns, as the wheel of fortune turns

Gotta sort it out but your shit just turned away, 
Just turned away girl, just turned away.
Tryna' sort my problems out from day-to-day, 
From day to day girl, from day to day
Gotta sort it out but your shit just turned away, 
Just turned away girl, just turned away.
Tryna' sort my problems out from day-to-day, 

From day to day girl, from day to day
If shit gets bad you're gonna pull out of it, 
Think twice if you've got any doubts with it
'Cause it's not about pain in this life we live in
Let the chapter begin

Then a coach ride to the station
""My lord, the carriage awaiteth!""

Kneeling on the parquet
Whatever has gone wrong?
The fear and feeling hopelessness
I don't want to belong

I dreamt I was back in uniform
And a candidate for examination
History, someone had blundered
And a voice rapped ""knuckle under!""

Since the day I've spoken
My home was broken to
When the door was open
I was out and smokin'
I didn't look for trouble
Trouble looked for me
But that'd be a lie you'd see
Me and trouble got along just fine
Out getting pissed on the beer and the wine
It didn't take long before I met people just like me
Feel plot and foxy
We made a little team, if you know what I mean
Checked a few scenes
Seen a few fiends
Sprayed a few trains
Played a few games
Hung around with faces and names
Went out with pretty young dames
Young love and young flames

It's alright, just keep on moving

Wasn't nothing but sorrow in the house
I wasn't there
I went out
With the boys just hanging about
Playing round and acting like louts
In them days overcoming our doubts
Serving up just to keep a little clout
Ploty introduced me to stealing
I knew ol' mothers words now had lost their meaning
Just stole paint to put up my name
Pretty soon it all seemed the same
So this was my brand new game
Stone island, and Ralph Lauren
That's what we were wearing then
I loved them days so I look back again
The club scene was banging at the time
House and garish, pills and white lines
Kurosawa little strain on the mind

We were fine

Tommy d was the next man's name

But we didn't make that for fame
We made a few tracks for mankind to pay (play)
And that's true, what more can I say
I'm not in the game to play
I'm just in the game to say
Everything's gonna be okay
Don't stress cos there's always a way
Doesn't matter if your jeans get frayed

Wear you away
Pacing holes in linoleum
Stuck in a rut
Still love him too much
Hard to believe
How far down you have come

Bottle to glass
Glass to your mouth
A ritual you've grown
Accustomed to these days
Windows no lights
Alone in a room
The afternoon sun abandons you

You're frozen stuck in the past
'cause nothing good seems to last
You broke down somewhere along
'Cause nothing good lasts very long.

Your children all raised
No one to tend
You burned all the bridges
With all of your friends who
Stood by your side
In sorrow and hate
You've driven them
Driven them all away

You're frozen stuck in the past
'Cause nothing good seems to last
Afraid you'll fade till you're gone
'Cause nothing good lasts very long

You make the worst
Of everything you
Childhood dreams that never came
Still can't accept
He up and left you
Wedding vows still remember the day

Your children raised
No one to listen
Pull the drapes shutting out the sun
You pour yourself - yourself another
While the out - the outside world
Moves on leaving you behind

Looping it inside your head
'til it becomes frayed
Stuck in a rut
Minutes turn hours into days

And I blame you

This goes out to

Was just too far out of reach
And though I want it still
Not sure it ever will

God how I miss you
Another seven weeks until
I called you on the phone
But you weren't at home

Pulling out your photograph
So many things
I wish I'd said

I passed through my home town
One of the few that made it out
Nothing has changed
It stayed the same

I ran into an ex-friend
We never had made amends
And after all these years
Things still are weird

There wasn't much - much to say
Friendships often fade away

Been trying to write
This letter to you
Disjointed thoughts
Just can't seem to
Get them to display back
What I want them to
Crumpled failures
Litter the room



",The Dream
Audio Learning Center,"I've got my own religion
I make it up as I go along
I've got this friend
Who says he's been born again
And if he's right
We don't have long

My doctor gave me a prescription
With unlimited refills
Supposed to make all my days
Exactly the same
I'm in perfect health
With my pink pill

They tell me I'm doing better now
I'm no longer a danger to myself
Besides the occasional side-effect
They tell me that I should
Do pretty well

They've informed me that
I'm being released
And soon I'll be free to go home
Though they know
I've got no place to go
New budget cuts just won't allow

They tell me I'm doing better now
It's a game of think but do not tell
As long as I take my medicine
They tell me that I should
Do pretty well.

Once I finish writing out
These thoughts to you
I'm gonna pack up all my personals
And go back to where we used
I wonder if you're
Around there anymore

The voices in my head
The bad thoughts that I used to get
An occasional side effect
As long as I take my medicine

I'm doing
They say I'm doing well

My doctor gave me a prescription

But it was feelin pretty good so what, the heck
The hickey went on, and I went home
I tried to brush it off then I used a comb
The comb didn't work it got bigger, and redder
Giz said, ""Yo Milk man you shouldn'ta let her""
But I did Giz, and now I gotta get it off
I tried lotion but it just got soft
The hours went on, and on, and on
Man - I wish the hickey was gone
But it wasn't, and, my girl was comin over
I needed a plan, to try to get over
So I called King of Chill I said, ""What's up man?
Got a hickey on my neck, I need a plan""
He said, ""Yo Milk why don't you bust a turtleneck?""
I said that's wack but what, the heck
I ran to my room but I couldn't find one
Then like Star Trek, _The Search_ begun
I ran through my house from the bottom to the top
I got a bright idea, I'll ask pop
I ran to dad, I said, ""What's up D?
I need a turtleneck, to cover this hickey""
He said, ""Oh son that just won't work;
you'll feel real hot and you'll look like a jerk""
I said, ""Okay - then what's your advice?""
He said, ""Go into the freezer, and get a piece of ice""
I said a piece of ice, to put on my neck?
It sounds real cold but what, the heck
I went into the freezer, and did what he said
I hope it would 'ork, or else I'd be dead
I put the ice on and I waited, and waited
The hickey was gone - it faded, it faded
The time was then for my girl to appear
At the count of three, what did I hear?

One
Two
Three

It was the bell, as you can tell
As I opened the door, my eyes did swell
As I, saw somethin' I thought I never would see

I punched her in the mouth her lip I did wreck

Yo, my name is Milk, when Milk is on the mic
I say all the rhymes you MC's hate
I really don't care what you think or say
I gotta bust a rhyme in my own special way
Giz is my brother, mom is my mother
Dee is my father, you say why bother?
Because they put me here on this earth
Lyte is on my side and she is worth
more to me than you, forget your crew
It doesn't matter what you say, or what you do
I'll keep on rockin, I roll too quick
All you groupies make me sick
The King is my boy cause he's down with us
First Priority's the label, that we trust
I really don't care if you're big and bad
I'm makin more money than you wish you had
Girls step up if they know what time it is
The left to Milk, the right to Giz
I never throw a mic cause I have respect
And when I come, I come correct
To my left to my right I have bodyguards
And in my wallet, credit cards
In my pockets, hundreds, and more
I give it to your mother, cause your mother's - a stunt
I really don't care if you're gettin mad
I call you son, son, you call me dad
I never take drugs, I like to drink
milk, it helps me grow and think
like a champ, suckers I vamp
Soggy MC's will always stay damp
In my presence, and in my residence
I keep keys to my car, I go real far
to pick up my money
I think it's dope, you think it's fun-ny

(*sample of Milk saying ""I don't care"" repeats w/ variations*)

[Milk]
But, you, never ever bothered a brother like me
I have too much personality
When I produce, you say it's def
I'll pan it right then I'll pan it left
If I want I keep it right in the middle
You look puzzled, it isn't a riddle
It's, a rhyme, one, of mine
One of a kind, girls say we're fine
What's on your mind, you said I'm through?
You must be stupid, the Audio Two
is here to stay, every day
It doesn't matter what you think or what you say
We'll keep on rockin, keep on shockin
You'll keep lookin, starin, and mockin
Milk style, my brother
You're, a fighter, I'm, a lover
And when I'm at a jam I'm always undercover
Unless I get paid then I do, a show
When I'm finished, I always go
I got speakers, the size of your girl
Boomin the room an', shakin your world
Bigfoot feet are very big
If you're a sucker he'll help you dig
your grave, or maybe he'll save your life
Mike shot the sherriff, I took your wife
Yeah you look mean but it don't mean nuttin
You got dissed with the push of a button
You paid your quarter but the game didn't start
It broke your money and it broke your heart
I stepped up and the game, begins
In this situation I surely win
I am the Milk like the milk you drink
I don't care what you say or what you think
I'll keep on movin, keep on slayin
Groovin MC's that think I'm playin
On, the mic, my style, you like
If you don't then leave..
And I'll end this jam with time to breathe, boy!

Fraget eure Mitmenschen nie nach ihrem Sternzeichen
Und erkläret nicht, was diese für sie heißen

Weiß wie er als Stier auf Krebs und auf Fische wirkt (Jesus)

Doch willst ja keinen von denen seine Arbeit nehmen
Davon gibt es nie genug, nicht da wo's Menschen gut geht
Und wenn dir das nicht zusteht, heißt das, dass du nicht dazu zählst
Frauen hätten Angst, also noch mehr als sonst
Zumindest auf die Idee, könnte man selbst kommen
Also ab nach Hause am Besten zu Fuß
Sonst zahlt am Ende auch noch irgendwer für deinen Flug

Until the day was gone
And I sat in regret
Of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed
And all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death
I will wander on

Gathering the flock
And getting there with no directions

It turned into a march

To lay your burden down
And leave you where you stood
And you believed I could
You'd seen it done before
I could read your thoughts
Tell you what you saw
And never say a word
Now all that is gone
Over with and done, never to return

I can tell you why
People die alone
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun

Staring at the loss
Looking for a cause
And never really sure
Nothing but a hole
To live without a soul
And nothing to be learned

I can tell you why
People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun

Shapes of every size
Move behind my eyes
Doors inside my head
Bolted from within
Every drop of flame
Lights a candle in
Memory of the one
Who lives inside my skin

I can tell you why
People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come

And inside her shown a young light
From her labor I was saved
Though I've traveled long in darkness
In her harvest I'm embraced

Oh oh when you come down to take me home
Oh oh send my soul away
Oh oh when you come round you'll make me whole
Oh oh send my soul away

Now the spires and gables 
Grow in orchards to the sky
And the blessings on the table
Multiply and divide
Oh oh when you come down to take me home
Oh oh send my soul away
Oh oh when you come round you'll make me whole
Oh oh send my soul away

More than luck
More than fiction

Out and on, thought I'd set this room a light
Left alone forever and for crimes unclear
With my patience gone, someone take me far from here

Yeah, burn that gasoline

New day only another day in solitude
Houses honest, clearly more than I can bare
Drag me off before I set my world on fire
I am gone, the sun will never set tonight

Yeah, burn that gasoline
Yeah, burn that gasoline

No more forests, only a can on red
Says 'Danger' on it, I have found another way

Burn that gasoline
Yeah, burn that gasoline

Burn it all away
Burn it all away

To feel this way?
How could the moment pass?
Unfelt?
Ignored?
Where was the blinding flash,
Where was the crashing chord?
When did I fall in love?
I can't recall,
Not that it matters at all.
It doesn't matter when
Or why
Or how,
As long as I love him now.

When did respect first become affection?
When did affection suddenly soar?
What a strange and beautiful touch
That I love him so much
When I didn't before

When did I fall in love?
What night?
What day?
When did I first begin 
To feel this way?
How could the moment pass?
Unfelt?

Where was the crashing chord?

The quick toboggan when you reach the heights

The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me, sir, I much prefer

Diridiri, dirididi Daddy 
Go 

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote 
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY) 
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome 
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy (Oh) 

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal 
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan 
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh yeah) 

Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal 
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más 
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro 

Despacito 
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito 
Deja que te diga cosas al oído 
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo 

Despacito 
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo 
Quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le enseñes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby) 

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido (Diridiri, dirididi Daddy)

(DY) Si te pido un beso ven dámelo 
Yo sé que estás pensándolo 
Llevo tiempo intentándolo 
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo 
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom 
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

Audrey Lavine,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

What was written in the stars shall be
It was written in the skies

And so whether it bring joy
Whether it bring woe
It shall be done
Now suddenly I know

Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You
Audrey Morris,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Audrey Morris,"This town is full of guys
Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

I did once but I'll never ever do it again.
Turn around a little slower, round a little slower, round,
Turn around a little slower, round a little slower, round.

Turn me off
Cause the time I've killed has slowly killed me.
Turn me off
Let the light burn out and finally set me free.

I'm on a plane where my soul used to exist,
Simple demental so my hand closed up like a fist.
Turn around a little slower, round a little slower, round,
Turn around a little slower, round a little slower, round.

Turn me off
Cause the time I've killed has slowly killed me.

Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Hear pain and there fear.

Stuck by the ships,

Mild the bay seems,
Mild in the mist...

And gales gut the shore,

When there was no need of proof,
When lions ate flowers
And your house didn't need a roof.

There is no such place 

Blasted in appearance and 
A composite of fearful minutes 
Frozen in the waking instant 
Longing, things I long for, 
Peaceful nights, 
Strangers at the door, 
O come in, come in, 
You've been here before. 
There is no such place, 
So perhaps we have a reason 
For our long and falling face, 
Above all it would be warm 
But we would keep our heads all 
Clear as Winter, storms would be 
A sight to make us shiver 
But without the chill 
Of thinking all is hither-thither 

Longing, 
Things I long for, 
Peaceful nights, 
Strangers at the door, 
O come in, come through the door, 
You've been here before, 
You've been here before 
There is no such place, 
O yes I have seen it too 
Just a little different from how you do, 
A house upon a hill with no windows 
Just a can upon the sill 
To catch your tears 
To feed your garden.",There Is No Such Place

It's really going down

Now you cannot turn it round

Through a dream of French forests

Augie March,"A Tuesday night in Winter, holed up in the city of ravens, 
The owls in the hills hoo-hooing and eyeing off the field mice down in the cold grey centre, 
Addle Brains lining up with the dead for the soup spoon, 
Addle Brains and the legions of the passed for the bread bag, 
Ladle the soup, pass the rolls, 
Addle Brains and the many not here and loose souls. 

One might fly off to the blank heavens and the lead high halls, 
O the hungry sky aches for blokes without folks and bulges with the bearers of palls. 
Addle Brains would drink for four days and no eats, 
And sleep in the glens of botanical parks, and on the humped bus shelter seats, 
Where it's cold, where it's cold. 

One morning I woke up in a room in the nation's heart, 
And couldn't think for the life of me what I was doing, or where to start, 
Or what rehearsal was required, I was so sad and tired. 

What does a bird want with money? 
Was he made this way? 
Do you have to earn the right to find all of this funny? 
Nothing's funny today. 

Addle Brains mixes his powders with his fateful blues, 
And the wide-eyed bubs of the Parliament couldn't give a hoot, or even two. 
All it takes, it takes, is a kind look and a word, a word, 
Some pretty eyes and skin, from your fine family you were given to win, 
And spill it over into the basin of common sin, 
Just a drop, a drop of the stuff that makes us kin

I daren't dredge it up not while the weather's still cool,
It's a feathered thing, its origins are mixed and untrue,
Once a straw-body, now a lamb-picker, now a clove in a black brew
I think of the peacocks of the gorge and I think of the gryphons they kept in the Tower Zoo,
The unexpected water swept all before it

With all kinds of love, that it aches so

Though I wake from them mouthing
They leave me not able to talk
All these dreams are not nightmares

With my little bag, with my little dog
Who rests on my stomach and barks at the oncoming fog

Like a vampire carry my piece in the earth
To the place of my death to the plots of my birth

I thought I had found my golden September in the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour would lead to my wreck and ruin

Oh but the green-eyed harpy of the song land
She takes into hers my hand
She says, ""Boy I know you're lying
Oh but then, so am I,""
And to that I said ""Oh well""

They put me in a cage full of lions, I learned to speak lion
In fact I know the language well
I picked it up while I was versing myself in the languages 
They speak in hell
That night, the silence gave birth to a baby
They took it away to her silent dismay
And they raised it to be lady
Now she can't keep her mouth shut

For one crowded hour, you were the only one in the room
I sailed around all those bumps in the night to your beacon in the gloom
I thought I had found my golden September in the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour would lead to my wreck and ruin

One crowded hour, you were the only one in the room
Well I played a few songs for those bumps in the night
In fact I played this very tune
You said, ""What is this six-stringed instrument but an adolescent loom?""
And one crowded hour would lead to my wreck and ruin",One Crowded Hour
Augie March,"Some go high and very low
None too different or the same you know
I know 'cos I've seen them come and go

When summer comes the valley hums
With medicine trucks on the sidewalks
Laid out those hands could be holy

Stranger, stranger, hard earned familiar
I've got no jokes
And you hit me up for more than
Just my shrapnel and smokes

Some go high and very low
None too different or the same you know
I know 'cos I've seen them come and go

Stranger, stranger, stranger
Should be listening
Like a river to the end of my curdled song
Nobody knows what madness could come along

Now if you see a being borne into a trap, you free it
They know kindness when they see it
Stranger, strange would it come if you could call it?

Some go high and very low
None too different or the same you know
I know 'cos I've seen them come and go

It's quiet now, the streets are silent
When music out of the arms of community flies, flies

Stranger, stranger, I knew I knew you
Now the bug lights in the bank imbue you
With eyes like decals and a voice like an iron file

Stranger, strange, though the earth be an anvil
I'm not waiting for the hammer to fall
I'm not waiting for anything at all

Stranger, strange, though the earth be an anvil
I'm not waiting for the hammer to fall
I'm not waiting for anything at all

Augie March,"Here on the hill above the settlement, the buildings are talking
A tower to a terrace says the word's on the street, the dead are walking...

The brows are arched of the mews across the street
By a pale ochre light are made out heavy reliefs
Where all your dreams are borrowed all your senses are thieves
And Ned Kelly won't ride past your window despite the freeze on your disbelief

Don't bring 'em up if you can't put 'em down
Thin Captain Crackers bowling naked through the center of the town
The sun won't bake his blue skin brown, he's been too long underground

""I see,"" said a blind builder to his deaf daughter as he picked up his hammer and saw, ""if blood is thicker than water why'd you dress in the dress that you wore?""

The blind are drawn by a blank curiosity
(Don't bring 'em up...)
Drawn on mirrors where windows used to be (if you can't put 'em down)

Some people might say ""My desire's not the captain of me!""
And Red Barry might fly from his pedestal at night to spook the
University...

Don't bring 'em up if you can't put 'em down
Thin Captain Crackers bowling naked through the center of the town
The sun won't bake his blue skin brown, he's been too long underground

O tailor my bones what need new clothes but the lower half loves
What the upper half loathes, I could get around like an intellectual I
Suppose, wearing the highs with the lows
But I'd sooner sing these doleful drones by barcoo dog and
Lagerphones, but my hand don't write when a feather it holds, it hangs like a wren with its neck wrung, as did the bells in my quasi commode where I have to shift my head to see where my pillow goed, some mornings I wake up by the side of the road
Bringing it up for the gutter
After putting it down for the crowd?

I said I would arrive in the capital?
After chuckin' outside the St. Augustine's purple parish hall?
Don't bring 'em up if you can't put 'em down
And you know I can't",Thin Captain Crackers

He's pale and rising,

He started of small couple pills and marihuana
Now he's thinking he should go out on the block

Weather still getting colder, we could change the weather now

But I do what I gotta do
You've been at the bottom, you see the hunger inside of you
Don't say what you won't do

When the going gets tough it'll drive you insane
See I done dodged a couple shots
Served a couple blocks
Hit a couple corners tryna shake a couple cops
A broke a couple rules
Didn't graduate from school
Cus I was busy hustling, man, I thought that shit was cool

See I gotta keep it real with you baby
Cus the shit I used to do is what made me
And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap

Would drop a verse and tell the people how we hurtin'

Niggas got packs, trying to get them racks
X5 I was riding in the back with the brother's' round kicking in the gat in my lap
17 had no dreams, drinking four loco's, Sprite and codeine

I swear nobody told me

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Phone just rang heard a nigga got got
He was over in the East, last thing that he heard six shots
He ain't gettin' no love from the cops, nobody got caught
Real talk when I heard who it was, heart damn near stopped
Somebody done killed my brother, now I gotta get back
Let em know cause a nigga gotta feel that!
Sitting shotgun with the shot gun
When you hear the shots come, nigga don't run!
Already bad, it can only get worse
Hand full of steel cause the shit still hurts
Cut so deep when they put him in the hearse
Never saw 25, had to put him in the dirt

No one told me life would be this way!
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same!
People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Once upon a time down town in a nine (9th ward)
Where they don't mind dying
Sworn to a life of crime, was a youngin' that only stood 5'5
Big money on his mind, clothes ain't wrinkled while his hands on his iron.
Shot six times right in front of my mom
Kind of 32, man, I'm lucky to survive
On that Pac juice real niggas don't die!
Bitch, I'm from A-town, slang crack on the same set
Blood stains there from a homie with his head cracked
O'Gs like A' wacks they'll be doing this shit way back since A track.
And we yell where the gang at
You can get fame there from the way you're going to bang that
Shoot for the head watch how you aim that
Price on your head and we gonna take that
It's about to go down, you ain't about this then you better go now
Sun going down, keep it going down!
Everybody lay down ski mask down!
All you gonna see is my eyes and my frown
Last thing you hear is my gun going pow
It happens every day round my way
This ain't nothing new you grew up downtown

People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
I'm just trying to make a way,
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em",Downtown

August Alsina,"I'm a young nigga who just lived life
I done seen so much shit just from the very bottom

So it was always about just grinding and getting it out tha mud fa me

I just want a nigga to know what I thought

I got an opportunity
It's way bigger than me

'Cause you know God put nigga in a position
For a reason

I was d-block in the street life
Was on my grind so I didn't sleep nights
Used to push rocks out on my block
Saw police lights, I heard the gunshots
I had nowhere to go
At the end of the road
Had to do something fast
Now I ain't running no more

'Cause I found the light at the end of the tunnel
That's why I kept my head high
Instead of selling my faith
Sitting here wishing I would die
Living in hell on earth
Dead last so I couldn't see first
But I knew it wouldn't get worse
So it only got better (better)
And it's getting better
Living in hell on earth
Dead last so I couldn't see first
But I know it wouldn't get worse
So it only got better (better)
And it's getting better

'Cause I knew one day that life would get better
Finally made a way so now it's all better
'Cause I knew one day that life would get better
Finally made a way so now it's all better",Hell on Earth
August Alsina,"You're looking so good right now
And I would if I could, pull you right now
But I know that you're the type to make me crazy
'Cause you've got all my homies trippin' on you lately

I think you put something in the air
Your body's so amazing, and one could even say it's blazing
You're wrapped tight, oh, you've got it going on
'Cause you keep your hair nice
Oh, and I ain't even trippin', cause my homies hit first
'Cause baby when I hold you, I know we can make it work
So let me get your contact and a place I can meet you at
Baby, let me hit that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I know that's super on, and I'm super high
I'm like Superman, 'cause I'm super fly
I need that!
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I know that super on, and I'm super high
I'm like Superman, so baby let me hit that!

Now you look good enough to eat
And every time we kiss it's Swisher Sweet
I feel a spark every time we meet
Yeah, you do things to me

I think you put something in the air

I'm like Superman, so baby let me hit that!

When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is
Wash up, make sure I'm presentable, before I lay one finger tip on you
Every day I'm in the whip with you
Crack them windows, let them look-at-whose come close, get a little whiff of you
My old thing in my newer coupe, ain't nothin' changed
Addicted to that, lifted off that
Every time I hear your name, I'm ready to let that paper flip
I've never been labelled as a trick, but I'll pay for it if I want it
I'm always high, stuck in the moment
Had a convo with one of my homies
Told me 'bout when y'all first met
How viciously you put it on him
I couldn't even get mad about it
I was there, one of my partners got it
Super loud but she's super soft
Softer than a whisper
Ain't no gold digger, but I ain't never seen her 'round no broke niggas
Come smoke with me

Super loud, super strong, super green got me super gone
That super on, I'm super high
I'm like Superman, 'cause I'm super fly
I need that!

And I can't give up
They don't know what I'm going through

Nobody saw the struggle they just see the reward
They focused on the peace but they never saw the war
Homies I started with ain't make it till the end
They used to be my niggas now we ain't friends
Long as I'm putting niggas on it be all good
Soon as I tell them that I can't they the first to go

Now everybody run out with their hand out
Maybe 'cause I stand out, see me in the videos
Thinking that I'm cashing out
They don't see my homies with the notice on their house
They just think I'm eating so they sitting with an open mouth
Playing mac saying I should give 'em this in my amount
I remember back when I was hurting, working selling crack
Where were all these niggas at claiming they my fam
If I lost it all tomorrow I know they won't give a damn

August Alsina,"Started off in the streets
We would take collection from the fiends
People dyin' all around me
So I gave you my testimony
We were down from the beginnin'
When the world wasn't listenin'
Now that I got your attention
Let us in with the benediction

We are gathered here today
Paying our respects to bein' broke, hope he's in a better place
'Cause life out here ain't sweet, oh no
I would close my eyes to sleep but didn't dream no more
So I had to make a way for my home, you know
Now I'm in a place where I ain't gotta scheme no more
The good life, I'm done with the hood life
I did what I could but didn't always do what I should and I was misunderstood
So many nights I tried
To hide how I felt, I would cry inside
And I ran through the streets till my feet got tired
'Cause I ain't wanna have my shoes on them power lines

But I made it, and it made me
I know I did wrong, I prayed to God he forgave me
'Cause I made it, and it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger, I pray to God that you feel me, that you feel me

Our father who art in heaven
I pray you free me from my demons and keep me level
I know you kept my out of prison where I was headin'
When I heard someone killed my brother, one-eighty-seven
I hope he made it to your presence, for me he was a blessin'
At least I know he's restin' and he ain't out here stressin'
Tryna get to the good life, and out of this hood life
I pray that my step-pops stay off that crack pipe
So mama could sleep at night, I know it's been hard on her
I was ripping through the streets, it was hard for her
Now I'm up in hotels on the ocean shore
When I was sleepin' on the floor at the corner store

But I made it, and it made me
I know I did wrong, I prayed to God he would save me
'Cause I made it, it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger, I pray to God that you feel me, that you feel me

Started off in the streets

So I gave you my testimony
We were down from the beginnin'
When the world wasn't listenin'
Now that I got your attention
Let us in with the benediction

Bottle after bottle, snatching Belaire out the bucket
Rightin' all my wrongs for these homies out here thuggin'
Pray for benediction, pretty women on my premise
Condo out in Cabo, screaming ""GABOS"" to my nemesis
Gold around my neck I'm ballin' for these final minutes
Nothing lasts forever, for these sins I seek repentance
Shots fired, another gone, I feel that man's pain
Daddy sat me down and said: ""that came with the game""
Shake my head, roll up the window, turnin' up the music
So much anger in these songs for these soldiers that we losin'
A mastermind is one who's feedin' others off his talent
I owe it to my city but it's time I pay my balance
I'm in Holyfield's estate, I started with a pallet
I made my first tape, I gave that shit to Khaled
Thankful for my supporters, everyone that ever bought us
Grateful for every lesson these by any streets taught us

I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

My cup full I'm laid back, I'm bout mine you know that
I'm rag racing, zoom zoom, in a rush to get all that
Cross my heart, I die hard, come throw your hood in all black
If you real you'd recognize

All I do is grind and pray, riding through the streets all day

First thing when you wake up, before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
'Cause with me you ain't the same, you ain't gotta run no game
Girl 'cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission, I love your ambition
And I know how it is too hit the block and get the gwop
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damn I hope somebody spend some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
'Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money to make, so girl you know that

I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

You work hard for it, it's yours

Girl we got something in common, making money with ballers
See you pussy popping that onyx, keep it clapping at magic
Got them niggas tricking that chalice
Come on making this happen
Girl I love seeing your back bend, they cashing out
And you cash in, they going broke and you working
Back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be, when income is uncertain
Hustling just too make a way, and I know you thinking
Damn I hope somebody spend some money today

We grind together, we shine together
Show the single folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strong make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty, stacked up shawty
And if I ever need it, she the back up for me
Blacked up foree, his and hers 'Cedes
No hoes to the house, just the first lady
So gon' get your money, don't let nobody stop that
Even if you gotta pop that (work-work that body baby it's yours)
We do it big, and no together we about to do it bigger
My little mama hustle harder than a lot of you niggas

I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

Life ain't easy in the Easy, murder capital
Might not make it here tomorrow, like I'm running outta hope

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's not somebody who's seen the light

August Alsina,"I remember wakin' up, being broke
But still it wasn't breakin' us
I remember why I broke the rules,
Cuz I ain't really have nobody to look up to
I remember cuttin' class, bein' bad,
Cuz I ain't have what them other kids had
I remember wishin' that I knew my dad,
Then I remember wishin' I could get him back
For every single night that he told me he was comin' and he didn't,
For every single dollar that my mama 'nem was missin'
For every thing I wanted and was told I couldn't get it,
And that I had to face it that my daddy was addicted (damn)
That's right it wasn't easy growin' up,
Mama was exposin' us to life as she knew it
So we all went through it,
I remember bein' down and out, sleepin', on my homie's couch
In & outta trouble ever since my mama put me out

Damn it's getting real, damn it's getting real
Didn't graduate, I'm thinking damn I gotta deal
So I hit da block, selling rocks just to eat a meal
So I grabbed da Glock, kept it cocked
Peace is being still

In da back of da tracks, my nigga's stayed wit da packs
And if a nigga was schemin', my brotha stayed with tha gat
Yea, yea we stayed in da trap, yea everyday in da trap
These ho's was chasin' da cheese, so we would stay wit da rat's
And we was ridin' down, dippin' low, I stayed in da back
In the X5 stuntin', we ain't know how to act
Spendin' money like it's nothin', cuz we gone get it back
17 never thought that I'd be gettin' dem racks,
Had a dream but I said I wasn't fuckin' wit that
Mel told me I would make it, I ain't fuckin' wit that
But he told me that it wouldn't hurt to give it a try
Hardest thing out in New Orleans never see 25

Right then I woke up, broke out, told my nigga's had to roll out,
Moved to the A and got motivated, that inspiration don't run out
Heard my brother got gunned down and it hurt me to my heart,
So I kept grindin', I kept pushin', he told me to go far
So I can't stop at no crib, can't stop at no car,
Gotta keep going like there ain't no tomorrow
So I'm goin' hard everyday, 'til I got nothin' to say, nothin' can stand in my way,
I gotta stay, to show my nigga's a different way

Imma tell da truth and da whole truth,
Cuz there ain't no need to lie
And I ain't tryna keep it all inside,
So I gotta testify
For you and I, I testify

Imma tell da truth and da whole truth,
Cuz there ain't no need to lie
And I ain't tryna keep it all inside,
So I gotta testify

August Alsina,"Ever since day one
Somebody probably say you wouldn't be nothin'
I bet they told you this over and over again on repeat like a re-run
Nobody ever told you you could live up
To anything you want, don't give up
They rather tell you, you're destined for failure
That's what they tell you
But you just say
What about Martin?
What about Garvey?
What about Rosa?
What about Malcolm?
What if somebody told them they would never be nothin'
And they believed this, think about the outcome
Would we even be the way we are today?
Even if it weren't, could have been a harder way
Even though we lost a lot of people on the way
Had to sacrifice to get us in a better place

I hope you listen to these wizzords
All they want us thinking about is sipping on some sizzurp
And they got us thinking something better we don't deserve
And that you shouldn't try, it's no use
But that couldn't be further from the truth
Don't believe it, that's what they told me too
When I was growing up (They told me)
They told me (That I wouldn't make it too far)
And when I battle it'll hold up
(They told me) They told me, yeah
(That I wouldn't be anything)

That's what they tell, what they tell, what they tell
When we were little ones
That's what they tell, what they tell, what they tell
They supposed to be kings and queens
That's what they tell, what they tell, what they tell
When we don't believe them
That's what they tell, what they tell, what they tell

They say the ballers is celebrities 
As a reminder of the people they would never be
Jealousy got 'em sick without a remedy
Thinking when I die nobody's gonna remember me
I was told that nobody care
So the dreams that I had turned to nightmares
Is this thing called life really fair
Need help but it ain't there
So you know it's really hard to stay dedicated
When the ballers screaming they was never educated
On the corner getting high just to medicate it
'Cause the teachers just told him he would never make it
Now he feeling like he made it 'cause he stackin' paper
But probably won't let him spend the money later
Nobody ever told us we could be greater
To everybody on the grind and the paper chasers

I hope you listen to these wizzords

August Alsina,"Every day that I'm alive, I try to life it to the fullest
Keep my pistol and believe me I'll pull it
If a nigga tryna kill me, I know what I gotta do
Hope somebody feel me 'cause you know that I done seen a lot
Just a young nigga grinding for the block, tryna reach the top
Being broke would turn the bitches off, now they pussy pop
Tryna get the cash I got, now found love
'Cause all these bitches ass got shots and they so proud
But I ain't judging, if you thought I was, I wasn't
'Cause I don't wanna hit it once and I ain't cuffing
Young, wild niggas on here, can't tell me nothing
'Cause I remember when a nigga ain't had nothing
Now I came up, I got a lil something, tryna turn a lil bit to a lot
Like when lovers turning cocaine to pot
I went through the soda straight out the box
Hoping when this shit drop it will rock, hoping when my shit drop it will rock

'Cause ain't shit changed even since my nigga Pac got banged
Some of the players switched up and it's the same old game
I see no change, so I guess I gotta be that change
I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Showing young niggas how to make it through
'Cause I had to get it out the muscle, I can never loose the hustle
'Cause I represent the struggle a change
Guess now you can see there's a better way
So when we there, we'll make it to a better place
Guess it's looking like this shit will change
I'm hoping I can be that change

We could be that change
We could be that change
We could be that change
Make the whole world change
We could be that change
We could be that change
We could be that change

So many people outchea with nowhere to go
Mother's loosing their children for reasons nobody know
Places with no suns and nothing can grow
And people in poverty wishing they could be more
Making brand new kicks can make you rich
I rather be in brand new whips than pay our rent
Single momma's got 4 kids the income's fixed
Baby daddy's out on bond, still ain't shit
Never took the time to notice
The person in the reflection is the real focus
If we could change with them then I'll notice
Historically ain't nobody looking out for us
all they ever had was doubt for us

Cause ain't shit changed even since my nigga Pac got banged
Some of the players switched up and it's the same old game
I see no change, so I guess I gotta be that change

Yeah I'm guilty of daydreamin'
That I could change the world
You can laugh all you want 
But you can't blame a man for dreamin' 
And I seen so many people life go downhill, because they
Gave up they stopped believin'
They just stopped dreamin'",Change

Look at how far I've come and I'm here, y'all
If you think nobody feels you, best believe I know
Look, I can't turn back now when they've killed y'all
And I can't pay all these bills, y'all, better know one thing for sure
Look at how far I've come, even though I'm outchea stressing
Still I gotta do my best and let it go
So I know I can't look back now
I gotta keep pressing on, 'til I make it, somehow

I know some days you feel like giving up
Feel like time is running out and all you have is doubt
Tryna keep your head up, but you fed up, tryna stack your bread up
Like how come the outcome of my income isn't dough comin'?
No one is helpin', they just out for they-self
Outchea tryna make a way, hoping there's a better day
And when you think that you're done
And the storm is raging
Look through the clouds and you can see the sun
Sometimes I know it's hard and life can have you stressing
But you should count your blessings, and every single lesson you've learned
It takes hard work in getting it out the dirt
But how could you know pleasure, if you never knew hurt?
We all go through our share of pain, ups and downs
For reasons that I can't explain
But when it's all said and done
And you think you've run as far as you can run

Look at how far I've come and I'm here, y'all
If you think nobody feels you, best believe I know
Look, I can't turn back now when they've killed y'all
And I can't pay all these bills, y'all, better know one thing for sure
Look at how far I've come, even though I'm outchea stressing
Still I gotta do my best and let it go
So I know I can't look back now
I gotta keep pressing on, 'til I make it, somehow

'Til I make it, somehow, I'm gonna make it, somehow
'Til I make it, somehow, 'til I make it
So I know I can't look back know
I gotta keep pressing on, 'til I make it, somehow",Look at How Far I've Come
August Alsina,"As the days go by
I remember we was sitting on the aisle
Wish I could take it back to the days we lost
But it's easier said then done, someone had to pay the cost
I know nothing lasts forever, no nothing at all
Sometimes you don't ever get up after you fall
Every day's a gamble
I know you can't win 'em all
But that don't stop the hurt at all

One time for my fallen soldiers that were lost in war
Two times for my gangstas who ain't here with us no more
Three times for them fathers that ain't tryna do for they kids
Never thought that missing you would ever feel like this

I hope I see you on the other side
So we can kick it like we did before
I hope you leave a little room on the other side
So I know I got somewhere that I can go
I hope I'm not banging at the door saying let me in
And I pray that I'm forgiven for my sins
And I see you on the other side
Hope I see you on the other side

Real niggas don't cry 'til I seen real niggas who died
I ain't gon' lie, I had real tears in these eyes
Made me feel something inside, seem like I'm gon' lose myself
If I knew somebody else, I'm gon' need somebody else

It's so sad 'cause we can't go back

I'm always thinking my brain always gone in a blank, is God my friend or does God love me?

No fuck that, no it don't
More money more mother fucking problems, who put me here?
What's with this shit about we supposed to survive, right?
Where do I go next, what's next, that's something to think about
What's this shit really about, how did I even get here?
Why you don't wanna see a nigga eat?

I be damned if a nigga kill me, you win some you lose some

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might""
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His Mother Mary kneeling down
Unto the Lord did pray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises

And with true love and brotherhood

When is it enough?

Somewhere, anywhere, a place to hide

Waiting for this page to turn
I can't even bear the silence
Where is the ringing in my ears to sing me to sleep?
Where are those who feel what I feel?
Why can't I see the lights shining down on me?
Home will always be where my heart lives
But this is, this is my way out

This is our home away from home
Pouring our hearts across the stage

My future’s finally found me, figured me out
It’s painful, it's tough, I never saw it coming
Come as it may, because all of this life is a lesson
I’d rather learn than end up in a cold covered up dark grave

These are the words of a man who finally let go
These are the goals of a man who’s laid it all down,
Losing it all made me realize

I am the victim, the culprit, the casualty, and the 'cause
Losing it all led me to you, to you
Losing it all led me to you, I’m sick
I need sight, I need help, I need you, and I’m not getting any better

I am the deceiver, I’m not getting any better
I’m the thief, the whore, the murderer
It’s times like these, It’s times like these
you forget to remember who you are
The way up is down, truth is found when life throws you out
And kicks you to the curb
I’m just as much the problem as the man behind bars
He did with his business what I do in my heart
You wronged me, you crossed me, I’ll never let it ruin me
Lessons are learned deep down within my heart, in my heart
The worst men make the best stories come true
The past is a part of me
But not who I am

I realize my identity is not in
What I've seen but in what I believe to be true
I know what I need now
All that was lost is not lost
Even the worst of mankind can’t disrupt sovereignty

It appeared for a few minutes just after two

Maybe that was enough

My claim to fame
Won't come in the shape
Of hearts and flowers

What will it take
Everything that I know
And all the things that I've learned
To overcome what's next around each turn

How come I've been walkin' in circles
Believin' that the things that I love
They will always be perfect and around

How come I've been needing a purpose
Assuming that the world even cares

I'm really just lookin' for ways
That we could all be makin' a change
Fly together like one in the same
Ride together like a charm and chain
But that won't happen 'cause we're d-d-deranged
So addicted to watchin' you laid
Dark ass wanna be strange
Like me live only days
Like we best of friends

And I guess I learned a lesson
From the test that I was given
Just like all the rest is nothin'

Two kids told each other simple little things that would warm their hearts

Two kids broke the rules said they needed time, both packed their bags and waited for their ship to arrive
Two kids went their way found another life, filled that void with a curious state of mind
Two kids fell in love for another time and they wondered if this is right

I wonder what you're doing
I wonder why you never cry

And we never ever seemed alive
I sung about you once now

So go on and tear it up
Black and cold with the dust
Cause I believed in the lord
And he don't show up anymore

If you can't trust the wind who can you trust?
If you cant love sin who can you love?
If I begin will you let me finish up?
If I fell down would you pick me up?
If I don't drink from a silver cup, like you
Would you say, ""so long, farewell, good luck""

If the sun don't rise would the moon be out of reach

The fool in me
It's like a dream, you see
But if the world is right
I'll drive all night
And meet you there someday

Six in the morning, never felt so sweet
Just put on Lucinda baby, and dance with me
I know I'm hard to count on
Forget half what I'm told
You probably only know my voice from
A goddamn microphone

It's a waste

And the sun would shine every night
And I'll come meet you there someday",Meet You There

With a cold gun, in your wrong hand,
Get it right this time, get it off your mind,
Let the summer rain bring you rest
And shame and love

Carve your name in a black stone,
Swear to god we won't let go,
If you cant love babe, then you cant hurt,
We take the good times, with the worst,
Take your time honey, take your time.

Down a road that's leading me nowhere

The place where I am free?
Cause in my mind I need it
But you're nowhere near to me

Move to New York City
Take your woman by the hand
Leave her there with your things on the doorstep
And there's no way around it
Could this be our last dance?
So fall asleep with the t.v. darling
I'll be back again

Do you want to see it
The place where I am free?
Cause in my mind I've been there
And there's no one here but me

In the morning it'll find you
Let the light shine away

I'm backing down, you're starting over

Wouldn't stop the world from turning over
We've had a lot, I've had enough

Keep runnin' down a one way track

I'll be the one to take the hit for you

If I had a heart, I'd break it open

You'll be the one to break my heart in two
I'll be the one to take the hit for you

Oh, 
You can't walk away from what your heart knows
Oh, 
I'm holding on 'til you let me go

And all the dreams I had
They were lost along the way
And all the words you said
That you never meant to say
Well, no one else is gonna love you like I do
Come a little closer, honey
I can't live without you
No one else is gonna love you like I do
No one else, no one else

Oh, you can't walk away

Augustana,"It doesn't make the rain fall down
It doesn't make the world go 'round
It doesn't make the loudest sound
It doesn't mean I'm sorrow bound

It doesn't make the wrong things right
It doesn't keep you warm at night
It doesn't help you learn how to fight
It doesn't show the dark from the light

It doesn't take a sign to see
The best things never come for free
And even if it's made to bleed
You know that you can count on me

It doesn't make your plans fall through
It doesn't make your dreams come true
It doesn't make your old ways new
It only means I love you

And it doesn't make the river flow
It doesn't make your flowers grow
It doesn't make you feel alone
It doesn't tell you where to go

And it doesn't make a blind man see
It doesn't make a lost man free
It doesn't fix your broken wings
It means that you were made for me",You Were Made for Me
Augustana,"It's like life imitating life,
Constantly repeating history until it's blind
It's like time only speaks in rhymes
Repeating repetition til you're lost inside your mind

Was I a terminal distraction?
Or just a chemical reaction?

Or is it chance or is it fate?
Was I just standing in your way?

I find it hard to understand
How you love this ordinary man
And so extraordinarily
Maybe it's all unraveling according to plan

It's like life imitating life
Constantly revolving round the tips of sharpened knives
It's like time draws a crooked line
Repeating shapes and patterns til it just can't be defined

Is it a critical invention?
Or just fulfilling it's intention?

Or is it chance or is it fate?
Or are we simply meant to wait?

I find it hard to understand
Yeah that it's all left up to chance
And so arbitrarily
But if she sees something in me

It must be life imitating life
Manipulating varying degrees of wrong and right

I guess it might just possibly
May be all unraveling according to plan",According To Plan
Augustana,"Well this is not a lesson
And this is not a cry for help
And this is not a test
And this is not for someone else

Yeah, this one's for you and everything you do
For every time I said this one's forever
And this one's for me, I'm starting to believe
You and I were born to be together

And I can feel it right now, just where I want to be
I reach out, you're right in front of me
We are unstoppable, we are unbreakable, we are invincible together
And I feel alive with you
And I feel alive with you

Well this is not a battle
And this is not a field of blood
And this is not as easy,
Not as easy as it ever was

And this is not a message
And this is not a double shot

And I can feel it right now, just where I want to be

Augustana,"Am I seeing double, am I withdrawn
Depositing lyrics into a love song
Spider weaving webs for a catch that won't come
Am I pulling roses from a dead bush
A soldier running late for the ambush
Ready in the depth for a stone that's long gone

Is it too late?
It's never ending but nevertheless
I'm the first one to second my guess
And the fire in my heart came from ash and ember

And every I step I take, got the devil to repay
I'll never make it out alive, but I won't surrender
Had to take it day by day, had to learn the hard way
Like a phoenix rising up from ash and ember
Ash and ember

Am I reaching out for something that I can't grab
Something infinitely splitting into two halves
Is there something I forgot that I can't remember
Am I swimming in a river that was manmade
Demolishing a road that was just paved
It's like trying to catch a junebug in late December

Is it too late?
It's never ending but nevertheless
I'm the first one to second my guess
And the fire in my heart came from ash and ember

And every I step I take, got the devil to repay
I'll never make it out alive, but I won't surrender
Had to take it day by day, had to learn the hard way
Like a phoenix rising up from ash and ember
Ash and ember
Ash and ember

Have I climbed the ladder to the last rung
Am I simply gonna finish where I started from
Is the future just the past that I'll never outrun

And every I step I take, got the devil to repay
I'll never make it out alive, but I won't surrender
Had to take it day by day, had to feel the heartbreak
Like a phoenix I was born from ash and ember
Ash and ember
Ash and ember

Am I stealing something I could borrow
Is yesterday just waiting for tomorrow",Ash and Ember
Augustana,"It's cold tonight, hurts to the touch
I'd say it's fine, but I miss you too much
We're still so young, but old enough
To fully grasp the gravity of love

I feel so helpless that I can't control how
Your heart is feeling, but I think I just figured it out
I feel so human that it just might break me down
And bring us back again

Cause we're moving at the same speed
And we're reaching for the same thing
We're like two in one, like the moon and the sun

And life is full of things we can't control
But the beauty lies, in finding someone wonderful
Like a full eclipse perfectly aligned, we just fit together

Sometimes we bleed, sometimes we cry
That's how we know that we're still alive
Stand next to me, lay by my side
We won't play victim to the rising tide",Fit Together
Augustana,"I lit kerosene to sweet memories
They linger and follow wherever I go
Warm ashes, used matches, late mornings 
too many nights in a row

You're never out, never out of my mind

We're a little unsure, we're a little scared
Guess we'll know a little more when we get there

Yeah you had love to spare
And I was barely there
I was a no-show
Things'll be different now
The second time around
I really think so

Dry riverbed, your comeback kid
Slow rising, kicking the dust off the road
Pale winter's spring, remembering
Things about myself I wish that I never had known

You're never out, never out of my mind

We're a little unsure, we're a little scared
Guess we'll know a little more when we get there

Augustana,"Tell the band they'll have to wait
Ain't no time to hesitate
Cause you and I are tied to fate
Whether you like it or not

You don't have to tell me twice
I ain't too proud to take advice
With a heart as cold as ice
You're the sugar to my spice

It's alright if you need a little time
Baby I don't mind, I'll be on the line
It's alright if you get a little scared
Life's unfair, but man I swear I feel love in the air

What is done is in the past
They say the good things never last
But you and I are falling fast
I'd like to test that theory out

We're raising up three children now
Little Mary, Elloise and Townes
Took me a while to figure out
Just how lucky I am

Tell St. Peter at the gate
Yeah you might be running a little late
Old man's gonna have to wait
Cause I ain't done with you yet

Said I'd hold you as the sun goes down
Ain't no need to wander around
Tell the kids to gather round
Man that's as good as it gets",Love in the Air
Augustana,"Hold on, watch your step
You gotta take a breath
No it ain't easy to fly

Get back, lose yourself
Got you and no one else
There ain't no reason to cry

'Cause in my life and times
She is paradise, I know you and I

Gotta little bit of faith in the hard times, oh oh oh
Gotta little bit of shade in the moonlight, oh oh oh
Gotta little bit of right at the wrong time, oh oh oh
Got you and I'm feeling alright
Babe I just need a little sunshine

Lay back, feel the beat
You got a hold on me
It's never easy to change

Try hard not to move
Let me get my hands on you
Don't want you feeling this way

No one's gonna break us
No one's gonna bring us down",Need a Little Sunshine
Augustana,"Will you hear me blowing in the wind?
Will it give you shivers down your skin?
Will you stop and stare, wonder if I'm there?
Will you think about me now and then?

Will you hear me when the stairs creak?
I always sang you what I couldn't speak
Will my voice carry on when your angels gone?
And will you still remember me?

Remember me, please remember me
May your heart be strong
May your fears be weak
And remember me, please remember me
May our love live on for eternity

Will you keep my jackets in the drawer?
And keep the kitchen how it was before?
Will you look to the sky in a cold dark time
And wish we had a little more?

Will you laugh about those little things
That used to piss you off and make you scream?
Will you stay up late reading books you hate
Tryin' not to fall asleep, so you can

Remember me

Will you keep those notes I used to write?
Will you hang em on the fridge at night?
Will you miss my smile every once in a while?
Will you think I was worth your time?

Will you find me somewhere in your dreams?
When you're swimming up against the stream
When the days get long, and you can't go on
Sweetheart just remember me

Remember me, please remember me
May your heart be strong
May your fears be weak
And remember me, please remember me
May our love live on for eternity
May our love live on like a child's dream",Remember Me
Augustana,"My lifeless shaky hands hold onto loves demands
I pray you'd understand, I'm just as scared as you
My hopeless hollow eyes, as empty as the night
I drained your blood and tried trading old lies for truth

Days go slowly, nights feel lonely
Touch me, hold me
You could save me if you'd only

Say you want me, say you want me
I just can't watch you go
Say you love me, love me only
Wait until you know

My shattered broken half is filled with broken glass
From every time I asked too much of you, I knew
One day, things would change
And one day, we could say that
One day, this storm would pass, pass over me and you

Days go slowly

Say you want me, say you want me
I just can't watch you go
Say you love me, love me only
Wait until you know
You can run and be free, if that's what you need
But if you turn back around, would you run to me and
Say you want me, say you want me",Say You Want Me
Augustana,"Saw my reflection in the mirror, didn't recognize myself
I felt more distant and more useless than the dust upon the shelf
I tried to fix it but I only ended up hurting someone else
Oh lover can you hear me, I'm so scared and I need a little help

I've built so many bridges, then I sat and watched them burn
I had so many chances, never took the time to learn
If I could change the past, go back erase what I had done
I'd redo everything, youth is wasted on the young

Yeah, you gotta crawl before you walk
Sometimes you gotta scream before you talk
You can't take back everything you've done
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young

Even the thought of me without you sends a shiver down my spine
I'd spend a lifetime on my knees for just the chance to keep you mine

And like a rocket I shot up and then I crashed and burned
I put the pieces back together as the seasons turned
If I could change the past, go back erase what I had done
Redo most everything, youth is wasted on the young

Yeah, you gotta crawl before you walk
Sometimes you gotta scream before you talk
You can't take back everything you've done
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young

Wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young

As songs are sung for the tender ones

The black thrash attack
Crack of thunder,
At dawn we slumber
In these clumps of flesh

Its the black thrash attack
A rush of agony mixed lust and terror for these
The burden, the flock, the masters and I
And a fairytale was soaked in blood

As remembrance prowled on through the night
A whiff of divinity brought scents of murder to this
The heavens, the masquerade, the winged one and I
And our shades were gracefully enshrined

A sepulchral voice did drain the soakened sky

Is a little bit of faith (yeah, yeah)

If you listen then you'll here the truth
Don't you know that his only son

Share the love that he sends our way
You'll find you've got everything
If you give more than you take (yeah, yeah)

I had the hottest muscle car in my hometown 
I could burn rubber in all four gears, 
But I haven't done that in a million years
Hey, little minivan, we're goin' to the grocery store
She's got an automatic tranny with overdrive, 
and the radio's tuned to Magic 95 
She gets 30 miles on a gallon of gas, 
And I can schlep all the girls to gymnastics class 
She's got her headlights on both night and day, 
She's the most practical value in the USA 
She's got cruise control, ABS & EFI, I keep her Michelins at 32 psi
Hey, little minivan, we're goin' to the children's museum
On icy mornings when I'm feeling my age, 
I'm protected and warm in my steel cage 
Her climate control really pumps out the heat, 
And her dual air bags just can't be beat 
She's rated real high by Consumer Reports 
And her two front seats have got lumbar support 
I've got the good driver rate and comprehensive insurance, 
And she's loaded with electronic theft deterrents 
Step away from the car, step away from the car 
Step away from the car, step away from the car
We're a wild and rowdy bunch when you pass us by 
Bobby's buggin' baby sister and makin' her cry 
If I have to pull over someone's gonna pay 
And it was fun, fun, fun, till Bobby took her teether away 
(fun, fun, fun, fun)
Hey, little minivan, we're goin' to the pediatrician
Now the wife and I hardly ever date 
'cause our baby sitter has to be home by 8 
We hurry through dinner & go out and park, 
with the fold-down seats we can nap till dark 
I dream of Barracudas and souped-up Vettes, 
Crazy games of chicken and drag race bets, 
Then she wakes me up and says, 
""Honey, don't be sad, our van's the classic Woody you never had.""

A red sports car will make me young again

Austin Lounge Lizards,"The curtain of darkness is fallin?
And my friends are all here at my side.
Are those the sweet voices of angels
As I rise on that heavenly tide?

All hearts overflowin? with sadness
And those words left so often unsaid
Then I could hear a voice whispering softly,
?Could I have all your stuff when your dead??

?Could I have your TV and your pickup?
And I?ve always admired your shoes.
Could I have that old dining room table?
And there?s a couple of chairs I could use.?

?Well, you know that you?re headed to glory,
And like a star, up to heaven you?ll shoot
When they write the last page of your story,
Could I try on that seersucker suit??

It was the voice of my dear brother Thomas.
He was kneelin? down close by my side.
His breath had just come from a funeral
For a mouth full of teeth that had died.

Well, I prayed my last prayer for salvation.
I was feelin? the touch of God?s hand.
But I could still hear the voice of my brother
As they struck up that old angel band.

?Could I have your old ski boots and surf board?
And maybe that four-poster bed?
Would you mind if I took a few records?
Just Nirvana, The Stones, and the Dead.?

Well, you know that you can?t take it with you
To your heavenly home up on high.
When you pass through those gates, and they had you your wings,
Could I have all your stuff when you die?

But the angels consulted St. Peter
And flew me back to my hospital bed.
My life was a new day a-dawning,
And the angels took Tommy instead.

I come down to work where the common folk throng
In my famous blue shirt with its patch that says Len

Leonard Cohen is working a day job they say
For bizarre inspiration and hourly pay
And I swear by the grease in the crease of my hand

I'm your man
I'll beg if I must, 'cause I'm aching to hear
Your story, as I check your brakes front and rear
Can you play a sad waltz on your cheap violin
Did you have a good time in Berlin

If Saint Joan should pull in, in her Charger of white
And ask if it all could be finished tonight
I'd say, ""Let me take a look under your hood
All that smoke doesn't look very good""
I'm on fire

It's part of the price every artist must pay

If you lack something basic in black

Our lone star flag's the waviest, our fried steak's the cream-graviest 
Our rattlesnakes the coiliest, our beaches are the oiliest 
Our politicians most corrupt, our stop signs most abrupt

Our guitars are the twangiest, our guns are the kablangiest
Our cattle the long-horniest, our yodels the forlorniest
Our cookoffs are the chiliest, our Waylon is the Williest
Our sausage is the smokiest, our neighbors are the Okiest

Austin Webb,"Early morning by the riverside
Saw an old man waiting for a bite
We started talking and he took me back in time
He said I was young and thought I'd always be
Then I woke up now I'm 83
There's so much I missed
Oh how I wish I could get back all that time I wasted

I see the tears of a young bride
The morning that we had our first fight
I should've held her tight
And on the day that my momma died
I hung up the phone and never said goodbye
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by

Well he looked up with tears in his eyes
Said I'm not sure if you were looking for advice
There's just something about you
That reminds me of me
It ain't easy always looking back
But it seems these days that it's all I have
And what hurts me the most is knowing what could have been
And if I listen real close sometimes I can

Hear the sound of my little boy saying
Daddy can you come play with me?
But I was too busy
Then one day my baby grew up and went to war
I never thought he'd be gone in the blink of an eye
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by

I shook the old man's hand and I thanked him
And I drove home as fast as I could go
Just to let her know
That I need her
That I love her
That I'm never gonna let another moment like this slip on by
Don't let it slip on by

We're only here for a little while
And God gives us only so much precious time
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by
Don't let it slip on by",Slip On By

Where we used to sit?
All them summer rubber-necks kept coming
To panel-van street
We just yacht club dancing, city girls were rich
I'm going to sneak out my window at four in the morning
Going to meet them on the beach

Steal away, hide away

I just can't wait, I just can't wait

I got a terrific Torana
A green hand going to wave bye-bye
I got a C.B. shuffle and a dashboard muffle
Pilot's twitch my eye
I've seen them from the mallway, supermarket spy
From the frozen goods section, the delicatessen
I've seen them racing by

They're going to wallow in the shallows
Great puce hippo
Bar-be-que and blubber
Please don't show, please don't show
They're going to steal my sand space
Out where the comperes go
You shoulda seen 'em bathers!

Going cruising for a nude?

In some countries even today police officers may search a person's home or office for evidence of wrongdoing and arrest him whenever they see fit.

In the United States on the other hand the Fourth Amendment protects the individual and his property from unreasonable search and seizure by officers of the law.

Double Jeopardy, the Fifth Amendment also guarantees the individual that he will not be tried before a federal court more than once for the same crime.

A knock at the door whether by day or night, as a prelude to a search without authority of law but solely on the authority of police, is inconsistent with the conception of human rights, enshrined in the history of basic constitutional documents of English speaking peoples.

Although the sanctity of ones privacy against illegal intrusion is one of the most important basic rights in our Constitution, experiences show that such intrusions occur at the hands of overzealous police officers.

Freedom of speech and freedom of press; the right to speak his mind is close to the heart of every American, the constitution prohibits most forms of censorship over the press and speechmakers. The argument against censorship is clear: no government official should be permitted to dictate what ideas or beliefs we are entitled to hear or believe. Both good and evil should be averted by more speech and not enforced silence.
Similarly while a person is free to make speeches on public streets he may be prevented from doing so when he uses a loud or raucous amplifier, which disturbs the public tranquility.

My bones are rot

See that I wont stop

The warm flesh, blood running down my throat
And face, relishing the bits of skin stuck
Between my teeth, drinking all the blood my
Young friend had to offer

I ripped the throat out of the infant I stole,
Holding the thing over me and letting the sweet
Blood rain upon my face, lifeblood gushing from
The gaping hole - the one I created, momentarily
Quenching my thirst

I lacerated the juggular vein of the prom king
With my filed teeth and quickly pressed my lips
To the gaping wound, supping on the thick fluid
Spewing from the virgin throat

With a thirst for blood
I sup on the life of only the young

Autumn,"And in the morning
After years have passed
It seems
Oh even now to overwhelm me
And in the stillness
After life has passed
It seems
Even now to grow like cancer
And in the fallout
After war days have passed
It seems
Even now to keep from dying
And there you are, going deep into and through me
And there you are, keeping distant all who knew me
And filling me with a new kind of life
But it's one I never wanted, one I never imagined
And even now, you send me reeling
For you and I have been together much too long
And though I drink my mind will not grow numb
'cause it's one I never wanted, one I never imagined
And even now, you know I'm reeling
For you and I have been together much to long
Much too long, don't you know
Oh and here we are, and here it goes again
I know I've waited much too long
I have weighed it all, delayed the fall

",Even Now
Autumn,"Seconds
Once ignored - now cherished 
As they begin to tick away 
Panting, like a dog in the wind 
Throat constricted 
Swelling as a tumor - I can scarcely breathe 
My eyes stand in the way 
To the world I need to see 
Hazy melting images coated in glue 
Begin sliding from my view 
And I trample on top of them 
Now a blind fool 
Now a blind fool 
Oh my heavy, heavy aching legs 
Cannot do the work of ten men 
To lift my feet of stone 
Clumsy, my arms 
Long and leaden - they drag behind me 
Carving deep trenches in the rotting earth 
Oh so tightened 
Stretched beyond belief 
My skin cracks 
With the weight of my dying body 
And the rage in my head 
Blood trickles down from my burning eyes 
And stings my charred lips 
Oh dear god - if you would but save me
So much as a finger on my hand 
Surely I could find the strength to climb 
Atop a cloud in your sky 
And echo your praises 
Into the light of a new day 
But my words are lost 
As my bones 
Snap suddenly 
And I am left to lie upon the burning remnants of my life 
Seconds 
Eternity 
The clock ceases inside of me 
Oh this silence, this emptiness inside 
For the grinding of my teeth at the searing pain 
Of my flesh and the stench which infiltrates my every pore 
Silence 
Eternity 
Might as well relax 
It's much too late 
To cancel 
All my reservations in hell",Seconds

Your back was turned
Curled like an embryo
Take another face
You will be blessed again
I was cold as I mouthed the words
And crawled across the mirror
I wait
Await the next breath

Like ice into my heart

A shallow grave
A monument for the ruined age
Ice in my eyes
And eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon

Like ice into my heart

Can no one save you?
Everything as cold as silence
And you will never say a word

And sickness, our foe, still blows
I noticed your fragile thoughts and stars that changed their colours
We sat together so far away...so far away
Yesterday I sang a melody of autumn
In your hearse we'll rest tonight

Affiliated with this army,and TRU be my click. 
Tattoes, all up on me,cause I'll die for this shit. 

My definition of a TRU nigga.I represent it. 
Is a soldier ready to ride for No Limit,and win it. 
And if I lose another tank dogg,he's always in my memory. 
I put you in a song and you become a part of history. 

To all my real niggas:don?t let the ghetto take you under. 
If you travel the streets,make moves,in large numbers. 
A couple guns,some extra clips,don't make you bigger. 
You need some niggas watchin yo back,you need some TRU niggas. 

[Chorus]

You have the right to be paranoid 
You standing in front of the Southern's finest. 
Bein broke and livin slow is some bullshit behind us. 
Million dollar dreams of gettin rich. 
 
Smokin my weed and drinking hennesey down by the pitcher. 
Ain't no slippin because my click is fuckin airtight. 
So playa hater get yo shit right. 
I annihilate you niggas I think is gonna bother me. 

No greater love then bringin myself on my enemies. 
So lord forgive me for thinking materialistic. 
But society?s full of bullshit. 
I done sold my soul,so you can label me a paid nigga. 

It feels good to be a TRU nigga. 

[Chorus]

Picture me with TRU records 
A made nigga.Immortal.
Us niggas never die.We multiply

Ava Cherry,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Ava Cherry,"Crazy Janey and her mission man
Were back in the alley tradin' hands
'Long came Wild Billy with his friend G-Man
All duded up for Saturday night
Well, Billy slammed on his coaster brakes
And said, ""Anybody want to go on up to Greasy Lake?
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of rosé so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're build like light
And they dance like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Stand up right now and let them shoot through you""

Well now, Wild Billy was a crazy cat
And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, ""Trust some of this, it'll show you where you're at
Or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her 'cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt."" She said, ""Honey, let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right, like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice
Just as soft as a spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Janey don't know what she do to you
Spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me

Now, the night was bright and the stars threw light
On Billy and Davy dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now, Hazy Davy got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and his shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt
Singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row
Felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)...

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

From some enchanted land.

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,

Comes on the darkest night
Only takes a moment to make us right
We can believe in love
We can be free at the speed of light

Is in the power that you acquire

There is darkness surrounding you
I hear you pray that you could see the sun

Always Have, Always Will

Part of me is the prodigal
Part of me is the other brother
But I think the heart of me
Is really somewhere between them
Some days I'm running wild
Some days we're reconciled
But I wonder all the while
Why You put up with me, when...
 
I wrestle most days
To find ways to do as I please
 
I always have, I always will
You saved me once, You save me still
My longing heart, Your love alone can fill
You always have, You always will
 
I was born with a  wayward heart
Still I live with a restless spirit
My soul is so well worn
You'd think I'd have arrived by now
I'm caught in the trappings of
My search for lasting love 
I've made mistakes enough
To last me a lifetime
 
I still slip, I still fall
But I'll always run back to You
 
I'm gonna keep trusting You
I see what You've seen me through
I'm goin' where You have gone
I'm letting You lead me on
All my days...always and forever
Never far...never leave me never
Here I'll stay...ever love me ever

I'll always love You","Always Have, Always Will"
Avalon,"I could live life alone
And never fill the longings of my heart
The healing warmth of someone's arms
And I could live without dreams
And never know the thrill of what could be
With every star so far and out of reach
I could live without many things
And I could carry on, but

I couldn't face my life tomorrow
Without Your hope in my heart I know
I can't live a day without You
Lord, there's no night and there's no morning
Without Your loving arms to hold me
You're the heartbeat of all I do
I can't live a day without You

I could travel the world
See all the wonders beautiful and new
They'd only make me think of You
And I could have all life offers
Riches that were far beyond compare
To grant my every wish without a care
Oh, I could do anything, oh yes
But if You weren't in it all

A child who sought to win his Father's heart.

Now here I am, a son so far from home.

Tell me, when did I lose my first Love?
Where did the fire and passion go?
Burn in me Your holy fire, give me back my lost desire,
And restore in me the love I felt for You.

Can I remember how it felt, when they looked into my face,
and they saw the love of Jesus in my eyes?
When I look back on my life, and question where I've been,
Can I really say, I've done my best for you?

Oh where did I go? (I've lost my way, I've lost my way)
Oh I'm lost and I'm alone.
Oh help me please, Lord lead me home!

Lead me back to You, where my life began,
Revive in me the yearning that has died!

Where can I hide, oh, oh? 
Where can I hide, oh, oh? 
Where can I hide, oh, oh? 

I will hide my soul in Jesus
I will rest my heart in Him

I will not let them in 

There will be no pain in heaven

I will hide my soul in Jesus

I find that He is leading us out into the world
Into the middle of fallen saints and sinners
Where a little grace is needed most

Come take the Light to darker parts
Share His truth with hardened hearts
We are not like the world, but we can love it
Come bring the hope to hopeless men

Until the lost are found in Him
He came to save the world so let us be
In it, not of it
Wait a minute

If we say we love them, why are we not in it
Why we run and hide
Entertain a stranger
Maybe entertain an angel

We need to be advised

All who are wounded by sin
And just as we are, we can fall in His arms
Rest and find shelter in Him

With burdens and struggles to face
Only in our losing
Do we really see how much we've gained

Open to how He moves
As His Spirit is poured
He will do so much more
Than we dreamed He could do

Some people are dying
How many people are asking for love

To give a little love every day

some can look so hard and miss the truth? (yeah)
Some will stumble over it a hundered times

Well, there's a kind of love the world can never deny
Let everybody see it in our lives.

(chorus:)
The world will wonder why when you and I
will shine His light.
Let hearts discover light when we decide
to let ours go.
We've got to give it up and live the love that opened our eyes.
Live your life.
The world will wonder why.

Why, why someone try and tell me why
We would want it any other way.
A heart can change before our very eyes.
Well, I've seen the difference that love can make.
Where is the kind of love the world can never explain
It's time to let the gospel put us straight.

(Repeat chorus)

'Cause we are livin' with a passion
What would be the reaction?
I know a single heart can change the world.
If we are lovin' with a strong love,
then their eyes will see and the world would believe.

The world will wonder why  (repeat twice)
Yeah!

Avalon,"I grew up in Sunday school
I memorized the golden rule
And how Jesus came to set the sinner free
I know the story inside out
And I can tell you all about
The path that led Him up to Calvary

And I don't know what to say
But I'll never be the same
Because He changed my life
When He became

More than words on a page of history

The water I thirst for
And the ground beneath my feet
He's everything
Everything to me.

We're living in uncertain times
And more and more I find that I'm
Aware of just how fragile life can be
I want to tell the world I've found
A love that turned my life around
They need to know that they can taste and see
Now every day I'm praying 
Just to give my heart away
I want to live for Jesus
So someone else might say
That He is

We run before Your throne of mercy

Avalon,"I've been so long in midnight 
Praying for the light of dawn
And hope;s been my companion 
In the dark to keep me strong 
But there's something awesome 
Shining out through the ebony 
And now my soul can finally see

There is glory in the night
So beautiful and bright
A glimpse of You
Coming from the other side
You are reaching through the stars
And You're speaking to my heart
I know it's You
Calling from the other side

How could I not have realized
You've been here all along
So constant and so faithful 
Through the darkness and beyond
It's unthinkable, undreamable
There's peace when I look up 
'Cause I see the evidence of love

The other side tonight

I am dancing through the night
Knowing things will be all right
Because of You 
I'll make it to the other side
You are reaching through the stars
And You're speaking to my heart
I know it's You
Calling from the other side",The Other Side

Maybe I'm too far gone
I'm not looking for sympathy
But I know something's gotta be wrong

Remind me now what it means to kneel
Get me out of the way
I'm learning still that your love is real
You've proven it's not a charade

I don't know how much I can take
Mighty fences are slipping away

You slowly break me down
You slowly turn me around
I'm learning how to live, I'm learning how to love
Now that you're here slowly showing me how

How do you say the things you say?
Do you really think I can change?
You love me with so much abandon
And you move in me with such grace

I am finally coming awake
Mighty fences are fading away

You slowly break me down
You slowly turn me around
I'm learning how to live, I'm learning how to love

What I would be if I am giving up my skin

I don't know where it ends
I look up to the heavens
Where do they begin?
From way down here
My feet stuck on the ground
And the wonders in and around me
Can it be?

You who made the moon
You who made the stars
I cannot express the sum of who you are
You who spoke the word
Living in my heart
I cannot explain it but some how you are
Somehow You are

Peering out my window, feeling pretty small
A perfect cosmic light show
And I know you made it all
It makes it all the harder to wrap my
Mind around
How you gave up heaven to be with me
Can it be?

Nothing high or low, above, below
Not anything
Can take that away, away from me
Take that away from me",Somehow You Are
Avalon,"Sometimes it's hard for me to understand
Why we pull away from each other so easily
Even though we're all walking the same road
Yet we build dividing walls between our brothers and ourselves

But I, I don't care what label you may wear
If you believe in Jesus you belong with me
The bond we share is all I care to see
And we can change this world forever
If you will join with me, join and sing

Oh you're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

The day will come when we will be as one
And with a mighty voice together
We will proclaim that Jesus, Jesus is King
And it will echo through the earth
It will shake the nations and the world will see, see that

You're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

To take a stand, to make a vow
I won't let go, you're not alone
Now and forever we'll sing together

So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us

Avalon,"For every soul there is a midnight
When it's silent in the room but loud inside
You lie awake what seems like forever
And you wrestle with the big stuff that can
Not be denied
All of life
Has led you to this moment

When the time comes
And the games are finally over
There's no more pretending
All charades are done
And the time comes
When the soul is finally ready
You know the truth and
This time you don't run
God is waiting there, you'll find
When the time comes

For every soul this is a dawning
When we see there's more it life than

Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured

Sometimes I can hardly wait for that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away to another time and another place

I've grown tired of earthly things
They promise peace but furnish pain
All of life's sweetest joys combined
Could never match those in another time, oh

And felt His spirit move in my life
I know it's truly just a taste
Of His glory in another place, oh, oh

Avalon,"We’ve turned the page for a new day has dawned
We’ve rearranged what is right and what’s wrong
Somehow we’ve drifted so far from the truth
That we can’t get back home

And where are the virtues that once gave us light
And where are the morals that governed our lives
Someday we all will awake and look back
Just to find what we’ve lost, yeah

We need to get back to the basics of life
A heart that is pure and a love that is blind
A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ
The hope that endures for all times
You see these are the basics, we need to get back to the basics of life

The newest rage is to reason it out
Oh, just meditate and you can overcome every doubt
After all man is a God
They say God is no longer alive

I still believe in the old rugged cross
And I still believe there is hope for the lost
And I know the rock of all ages will stand
Through the changes of time, through the changes of time

We need to get back to the basics of life

A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ
The hope that endures for all times

We’ve got to turn the tide, yeah
Oh and we need the passion that burned long ago
To come and open our eyes
There’s no room for compromise

Avalon,"Nobody stood and applauded them
So they knew from the start this road would not lead to fame
All they really knew for sure was Jesus had called to them
He said, “Come, follow me”, and they came
With reckless abandon they came

Empty nets lying there at the water's edge
Told a story that few could believe and none could explain
How some crazy fishermen agreed to go where Jesus led
With no thought for what they would gain
For Jesus had called them by name and they answered

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die for the sake of the call

Drawn like rivers are drawn to the sea
There's no turning back for the water cannot help but flow
Once we hear the Savior's call we'll follow wherever He leads
Because of the love He has shown
And because He has called us to go we will answer

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die for the sake of the call

Not for the sake of a creed or a cause
Not for a dream or a promise
Simply because it is Jesus who calls
And if we believe we'll obey

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call

And who will dry the tears that no one's seen?

And peace, beyond the reaches of your soul
Comes blowing through you, for love has made you whole

Avant,"Hm yeah, yeah.
I back again, in this town, to find a girl that i used to know.
I bumped into, a friend of mine, and she told me where to go.
She said go right down, the 56th street, make a left at the corner store.
There'll be a house in the alley way,
Hope she didn't move away.
I pray she's still around, 
But somebody came to the door that I didn't know,
And I knew to let it go,
Is it over, all over.
I let a good girl get away

[Chorus]
How could I ever let her get away?
Today is not a happy day,
So many words that I had to say,
And baby I miss you and I need you your love,
How could i ever let her get away?
Today is not a happy day,
It could've been our anniversary,
I'd do anything to have you right here in my arms.

Remember when, we talked about,
All the things that we planned to do.
Our wedding day, our house in the valley,
Maybe a kid or two.
We could've had it all babe,
But somehow it all fell apart.
I agree to take the blame, 
See I'm feeling so ashamed.
I never should've lied.

I'd give anything (I'd do anything baby)
To see your pretty face again.
Hold you, to feel you,
Heaven give me one more chance.

How could I ever let her get away?
Today is not a happy day,
So many words that I had to say,
And baby I miss you and I need you your love,
How could i ever let her get away?
Today is not a happy day,
It could've been our anniversary,
I'd do anything to have you right here in my arms.

If only it were possible, 
For me to turn back the hands of time.
I'd do anything, give anything, 
Just to make her mine,
I can't live without your love babe,
I can't go on another day.
Where did she go?
I gotta know.
I let a good girl get away

How could I ever let her get away?
Today is not a happy day,
So many words that I had to say,
And baby I miss you and I need you your love,
How could i ever let her get away?
Today is not a happy day,
It could've been our anniversary,

Girl you taste so damn sweet (yes you do, you got me)

There's a reason why I'm feeling this way about you girl
You got me going crazy, naw you just don't understand

your gown got you slippin'
your rollers and your hair piece
your flowers and your pillow
your lotion and your perfume
the way we used to celebrate
the times that you would make me wait
the joy you brought to my home
but now everything is gone

Your my water (Girl your love flow through me)
Like my money (And I can't keep my hands off you)
Your my suga' (Girl you taste so damn sweet you got me)

You got me, you got me, whoa
Your my water (Girl your love flow through me)

Pardon me if I'm talking fast and stumbling all over my words
I heard you were leavin' town I thought I'd be the one to know first
If you have a minute let me talk to you and see what's going on
Don't say it's nothing when it's something that's gone wrong
Now let me explain but I don't know what to say
Cause I don't know what the hell happened
I come in the house to try to work it out
And all you're doing is packing
Close your suitcase let me think straight
Damn what could be the reason?
Baby talk me I'm almost outta time

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do to prove to you that I'm gonna do anything
Only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay and show you that I done change
Cause in 4 minutes I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man
For no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

Who are these people I don't know in my house and they scratching my floors
Takin' furniture outside and the U-Haul pull up to my door
What's the reason that I get this feelin that you can't keep it real with me
Is it cause of the prime relationships I had off in the streets?
Never mind that this is your conscience speaking and you need to get your girl back
You gotta find a way to try to get to her heart
I'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson
Think conscience you're my last lifeline
I'm down to my last second

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do to prove to you that I'm gonna do anything
I only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay and show you that I done change
(I'm a changed man)
Cause in 4 minutes I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man (I'll be all alone)
For no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

(I've done) I've done things in my past
I thought this love would last
But I can't let you go baby
You're my everything lady
The reason I smile and the reason I talk baby
The reason I breathe, the only one for me, yea
You can't go through with this
If you left me my life wouldn't exist
Cause I'm still in love with you
And that's my word I don't give a damn what you heard
Oh, baby I'll be true

I only got 4 minutes
And I'm running out of time
I only got 4 minutes

If you would stop, stop running from whats real

Pulling your hair out
Losing sleep

Every time I look in your eyes (makes me remember, I still
Remember)
Takin' that flight out west,
Just down in LAX (it was December, the end of winter)
Stopped at the shoppin' malls, just for you I had to ball
Givin' you everything
You showed me things that I never knew and I thank you 

Okay okay lemme clear my mind (lotta things goin' on in my head)
You know the truth, you can never be mine (still trip off of all
The things that you said)
That you loved me and you need me (yes  you do)

I'll have to chuck it up but it'll hurt me so much (whoa whoa whoa)
Whoa whoa whoa (I really want you)
Hey God knows that I dont know what I should do (tell me what should I do)
Cause I'm still in love with you

Travelin' from here to there, only so much I can bare (I wanna
See you, but I cant see you)
Knowin' this from the start, didn't really wanna break no hearts
(but my emotions are still takin' me over)
Knowing you used to call, constantly my phone was off and I knew
This day would come
You would go and find somebody new

When I had time off, we could get that all
But you know I been werkin' for certain and I know that hurts you 
Someone else is fillin' my shoes but I'm not mad at you

Its getting deep
We don't need to rent nothing, we'll make our own movies

We don't need a videotape or a camera
To make this ghetto love scene
Who
I wanna welcome everybody here tonight (uh)
Its such a beautiful occasion (yes)
I wanna tell you the way I feel (you know)
This is for the ladies
I wanna take you to a place you've never been before (take you there)
Sit back and enjoy this ride

Our love exploding in the air
Like the works on the 4th of July
Or like the sun how it sits upon the earth
Shine through clouds in the sky
I might never get as much air time
As a pilot would get
But I'm sure right to do things
That we both haven't tried yet
Take a trip to the moon
Just me and you
And we'll shine on the earth
I'll show the world what you're worth

Did ya like that
Tell me
Did ya like that
I just wanna, I just wanna show
So many ways I
Wanna show you what
Take our love to another level
So many ways I
Wanna go to a new paradise
Just one blink of an eye
So many ways I can
And I'll never let you go

Cause this
This message of love is what I'm sending to you
I love you so much there's nothing I wouldn't do
For you, for you
Let me be the reason you come from the floor with nothing but love
Like an orphan at Christmas
Who gets a million toys
There's no words to explain how it felt when we met
But I
I'll try with this song and see how far I can get
It feels like Heaven
When you're wrapped in my arms, that's what comes over me
It feels like Heaven

I just wanna, I just wanna
So many ways I
Wanna show you what
Take our love to another level
So many ways I
Wanna go to a new paradise
Just one blink of an eye
So many ways I can
And I'll never let you go

Take you to a place far away from here
Go somewhere to erase your fears
And feel free about life, no worries, in your life
Take you to a place far away from here
Go somewhere to erase your fears
Grass is greener on the other side
Just sit back and enjoy this ride

So many ways I (lets go)
Wanna show you what
Take our love to another level (far away)
So many ways I (take a car ride)
Wanna go to a new paradise
Just one blink of an eye (just me and you)
So many ways I can (so many ways)
And I'll never let you go

With my girl beside me feeling naughty
Just watching her lay there
Such a sexy atmosphere
She hand on the pillow
Got me feeling to myself
Here we go

[Chorus]
I know I should go back to sleep
But I can't help it you have taken it girl
I'm not a but I can be if you let me
Touch it, harder
So many things that I wanna do that involves you
But first I need you
To make love
I know that you feel that
Wake up
I can tell by the way your arching your back and look me like that
Wake up it's early in the morning
But that ain't mean I don't wanna a piece of you
Wake up

When I came with the fellows at 12
All day got me tired as hell
But it don't matter cause I wanna get at you
I'm right there behind you thinking my...

Avant,"I thought that I figured out a woman, but what I learned it don't amount to nothing
Did everything I knew by the book, but it just didn't work
I figured happily ever after wasn't, wasn't in the plans for me
Had just about given up on love until you came around and showed me exactly what it was

I finally found someone, a girl I can lover forever never thought it would happen for me
Feels like I'm walking on water walking on water
When I'm with you impossible it's easy to do
Never thought it would happen for me
With you I'm walking on water walking on water

Nothing seemed to matter much without ya
But life has changed another song about ya, and even if I try to go back no it just wouldn't work ooh
Waking up beside you we am I dream it feels so unreal to me
Just like the heaven open up it took a while but I got my angel from above

I finally found someone, a girl I can lover forever never thought it would happen for me
Feels like I'm walking on water walking on water
When I'm with you impossible it's easy to do
Never thought it would happen for me
With you I'm walking on water Walking on water

Never knew true love could be what I always heard of
The closet thing to perfection you gave me a reason to believe that I can do anything cause

I finally found someone yes, a girl I can lover forever never thought it would happen for me
Feels like I'm (walking on water) walking on water (on water)

Whats next?
In this digital world

So much going on
When we eat we don't speak at the table
Its falling apart it's too unstable
It's just a shame I'm going insane trying remain continue to flame
But I need to know
Where did we go

When I did try everything in my heart for us to get through this
How would I know
That you would just walk away and leave me with these words you said
Its hard for me to handle it I don't feel relevant anymore
I'm feeling like I'm losing it I don't want to deal with this anymore
Where did we go?

Stress it reflects it in our faces hearts beat a different paces
I'm losing stability and wheres the humility that we once had
Hey
Laying here looking up at the ceiling
Thinking what happened to all of our feelings
Affection is gone direction is going house is full but no one is home
Where did we go?

How did you fell out of love with me babe
And wouldn't throw away the time we put in
Why does it feel like its going away
Love is on a rope and its slippin'
The first time that you caught my eye
You was something that I couldn't pass by
Never wanted you to leave my eye
All I wanna know is
Where did we go?

Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold 
And I feel a chill 
Staring eyes, while I hear the cries 
From out of the blood, the wine in the cup 

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony 
Welcome to Avantasia 
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony 
Welcome to Avantasia 

No way out, we got to run to the gate 
No way out , for some of the souls it's too late 
Jakob are you free 

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony 
Welcome to Avantasia 
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony

Avantasia,"Coming from the wastelands
Full of reason, common sense
Where their principles are blocking minds
And you don't understand

Giving you belief,
You never touch, you never see
But if you dare to try to grip it
You're accused for heresy

Here I stand to find the truth
And for ought I know
You're the one to show me
You can tell my spirit how to grow

No, the more I try
The more confusion on my mind,
And no matter how I try
I feel my eyes seem to stay blind

No use in analysing, forget about alchemy
Because the secret of all truth
Is the quest for - and you'll feel

When you knock right on the door
""Forever locked"" they say
A little man will let you in,
For you have always tried, to get inside

You're in quest for more to find the core
Your journey still ain't over
Your quest is your purpose, go on
You're in quest for more to find the core,
It will be never over
Your quest is your purpose, go on

Why did Vandroiy have to die, why 

Dreamers come and go 
But a dreamÂ´s forever 
Freedom for all minds 
Let us go together 
Neverending ways 
Got to roam forever 
Always carry on 

Walking down a misty road into the unknown 
Heavy winds may blow into our faces 
You canÂ´t kill the dream in killing the dreamer 
CanÂ´t tear it down 
Always carry on

Avantasia,"Drawn by the sound of that wild raving pound
No one has told me
I gotta know all about hell and below
They never told me
The quest for nexus
In your life and for all that's beyond

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more
That I want to know
I know what I'll never know

From far away, from the state of decay
You've come to wisdom
Many've been led, into madness instead
Toll of my kingdom
The quest for nexus has brought
Many men of genius to insanity

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees

Then you're asking for more, and the more that
You want to know
You know what you'll never know

As long as you long for the whole
You can't get a part of at all
How proud would the buildings of Rome
Look without a single stone

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more
That I want to know
I know what I'll never know",The Looking Glass
Avantasia,"Oh, I dare not to sleep anymore
Cause I see her face in every nightmare
In all the windows of my haunted house
And when I dream a dream of flowers
I wake up in my hand a bloody rose

'Blood shall come upon you'
So she spoke to me
Never knew she'd come back
Now she's on my dream

From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory
As foretold in their prediction
From the faces in my dream
They are coming back for me
As it was told in their prediction
Is it just a dream
Or just a wicked memory... Oh

Now I see her coming on her besom
The smell of brimstone
And the mark of the beast
From the open window
Is it just a dream
As she's pulling out the dagger to stab
A thousand times into my hurting breast

Wake up from the nightmare
Screaming when I see her stand
With the face of Jakob
A bloody dagger in her hand

From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory
As foretold in their prediction
From the faces in my dream
They are coming back for me
As it was told in their prediction
Is it just a dream

Maybe his conscience
Will send him a dream in his dreams
If I only knew, oh Anna -
If his soul also came free
Or maybe if Jakob
Would talk to the bayliff for you
I can't come for you,
I don't know how many souls were set free
To start a rebellion, don't know if I'll still have to flee

Oh that faces in my dream...
From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory...",Memory
Avantasia,"Caught in neverland, no purpose to be seen
There's no point of destination
Neverending wastelands, such a wicked odyssey
Don't know what we have done wrong
Lead us back to Rome to follow you again
Bring you power, get salvation
I know less than all but more
Than many who know less
I know it's keeping us strong

And while they are pulling strings
While they are in command
They're hanging on strings
And fate they do commend into another hand

Caught in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice
Tney call nether world what we call a paradise
Caught in neverland and their spirits cannot rise
From the nether world, they can't see a paradise

And the Roman whores, the masters and the slaves
Raging on without they don't know
Good intentions on their minds
Can't ask for why they bow down

Lead us to Eden, judge those who bite of more
Than they can chew to serve, without they ask
Or call in doubt the task

Caught in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice
Tney call nether world what we call a paradise
Caught in neverland and their spirits cannot rise
From the nether world, they can't see a paradise

Caught in neverland in the place of many eyes

Avantasia,"Mental vigour's been right on the edge
To a 'stupefying' hole of no return
Now we dance a holy war is won
But there must be more we got to learn

Don't you know now that I'm here I must go
Into the morning light, illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side, the Gnosis

No return, I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return, I must know all that I never could ask
No return

No I still can't leave the world in here
Soon I feel that I am gonna get her free
But I've smelled at and I long for more
Take me in, oh I beg, philosophy

Oh I got to know, more now so I must go on
Into the morning light, illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side, the Gnosis

No return, I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return, I must know all that I never could ask

No return, maybe you must pay
Many've been in quest for truth
Insanity has swallowed away
No return, but I wish you all the best
Go and face the tree of knowledge and be free

Avantasia,"I'm just a loser in the game of love
I'm just an stray boy in the shade
And how I wish to know what love is like
To find someone to contemplate

There's a voice in a million answers
To the questions I don't ask
A demon - I've got to contain
When I'm walking through the fen
Getting deep into the black
There are whispers that I can't restrain

Don't give in

Rise to fame - time will come
Make your claim - time has come
For the crow to fly away

So you're an angel meant to walk down here
And you believe it's all divine
And you don't play by all those temporal rules
You watch the world begin to die

Alright - when the lamb's been torn to pieces
I've been crashing from the sky
The fallen to care for the prey
They put a spoke right in your wheel
I'm the one to dare the weak
To push you all over the pain

you give in, oh

Rise to fame - time will come
Make your claim - time has come
For the crow to fly away

I close my eyes
And I see what's coming my way
He's got treasure in his eyes
That he's gonna turn to clay

Hm, I'm a stranger, I'm a changer
And I'm danger... maybe...

Fallen Angel - waiting for the prey
The devil has come to take a maimed away
Penetration of the twisted mind
The evil is out for the weaked blind

I can feel it in your voice
Ever so sweet, no
Do I really have a choice, no no no

Oh, you burn your feet on unholy ground
You roam the barren wickd plains abound
In evil lies and evil speak
Abound in all you evil freaks

When you say it's all divine
And meant be
What about your flesh and blood
And defiers like me?

Their evil eyes are looking down on you
And those who don't are losing sight of you
Facing the rage to chase away
The specter of disgrace and shame

withered roses dying on the ledge
A withered dreamer standing on the edge
You dream of love but you wake up to pain
You're better off to join in my game

Then she'll be better off to cry contrite tears
One day she'll wonder why
She had to let you disappear oh dear

Rise to fame - Your time has come
Time will come - To take the sun
Make your claim - You're drawn to the sound
Time has come - You're leaving ground

Rise to fame - the flight of the crow
Time will come - Cross the line
Time has come - For the crow to fly away
It's a flight to hell
Can you hear the bell
The devil has come
To take your soul away
A flight to hell - Alright

I'm a changer
And I'm danger
