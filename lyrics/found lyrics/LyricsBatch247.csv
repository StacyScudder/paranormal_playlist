Kidz Bop Kids,"Funny how I find myself
In love with you
If I could buy my reasoning
I'd pay to lose

One half won't do

I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself?

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends
(It never ends)

Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
If I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose

I'd tell myself
What good you do
Convince myself

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends
(It never ends)

I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself?

It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends

It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends

Kidz Bop Kids,"Everybody's talking
But they don't say a thing
They look at me with sad eyes
But I don't want their sympathy
It's cool you didn't want me
Sometimes you can't go back
By why'd you have to go
And make a mess like that
Well I just have to say before I let go

Have you ever been low
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know
Were you left out in the cold
'Cause what you did was low

No I don't need your number
There's nothing left to say
'Cept I never thought it'd
Hurt this much to be saved
My friends are outside waiting
I've gotta go

Have you ever been low
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know
Were you left out in the cold
'Cause what you did was low
What you did was low
What you did was low
What you did was low

I walk out of this darkness
With no sense of regret
And I go with a clear conscience
We both know that you can't say that
This to show for all the time I loved you so

Have you ever been low
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know
Were you left out in the cold
'Cause what you did was low

Have you ever been low
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know
Were you left out in the cold
'Cause what you did was low

Hey Britney, are you ready, uh-huh, are you?

It's whipping my hair
It's pulling my waist

Kidz Bop Kids,"Made a wrong turn once or twice
Dug my way out of the fire
Bad decisions, that’s alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss “no way it's all good”
It didn’t slow me down
Mistaken always second guessing
Underestimated
Look I'm still around

Pretty pretty please
Don’t you ever ever feel
Like your less then
Less then perfect
Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like your nothing
You are perfect to me

You're so mean (you’re so mean)
When you talk (when you talk)
About yourself you were wrong
Change the voices (change the voices)
In your head (in your head)
Make them like you instead

So complicated
Look how big youll make it
Filled with so much hatred
Such a tired game
It’s enough
I’ve done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons
Seen you do the same

Pretty pretty please
Don’t you ever ever feel
Like your less then
Less then perfect
Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like your nothing
You are perfect to me

The world’s scared so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be thinking is to be sincere
So cool in lying and we try try try
But we try to hard it’s a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics 'cause they're everywhere
They don’t like my genes they don’t get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that
Why do I do that
Why do I do that?
Yeah yeah yeah oh
Oh pretty pretty pretty

Don’t you ever ever feel

Words can't bring me down

Yes words can't bring me down
Oh no
So don't you bring me down today

So consumed
In all your doom, ooh
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone
Left the puzzle undone
Ain't that the way it is

You're beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring you down
Oh no

No matter what we do (no matter what we do)
No matter what we say (no matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (yeah, oh yeah)
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (the sun will always, always, shine)
And tomorrow we might awake
On the other side

We're beautiful
No matter what they say
Yes words won't bring us down
Oh no

In every single way
Yes words can't bring us down

Kidz Bop Kids,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street

It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, 'cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theatre set to ill
Buggin' , cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, yo, that was def!
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street

It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12 30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool to quench my thirst
I thought to myself, Yo! This heat is the worst
But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone, but the TV was on
I thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button, and I then almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind, it said
""You are my favorite rapper, but now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke inside my drawers and screamed, so long 'cause!
Got halfway up the block, I calmed down and stopped screamin'
And thought, Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin'
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I'm thinkin' since this is a dream, I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the big, bad, Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do. We've got a lotta work here, me and you
The souls of your friends, you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brains.""

I said, yo, Fred. I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work
The girls won't be yours, Fred, your face is all burnt
Fred got mad and his head started steamin'
But I thought what the hell, I'm only dreamin'
I said, please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep
But gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week
I pat him on the shoulder, say, ""Thanks for stoppin' by.
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care, guy!""
He got mad, threw back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, Hold up, that hurt

It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, Freddy, uh, uh, there's been an awful mistake here.
No further words, and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head and said
Oh please, do somethin' with Fred!
He jumped on my bed and threw the covers with his claws
Tried to get me but my alarm went off. and then
Silence
It was a whole new day, I thought
Heh, I wasn't scared of him, anyway
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

And hope that this is just imagination

Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood

Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rots inside a corpse's shell

The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb

What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you?

Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind,
I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way,
You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say,
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career,
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone,
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin',
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses,
For while you're not around, and feeling so useless,
It seems one thing has been true all along,
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone,
I guess I've had it with you and your career,
When you come back I won't be here and you'll can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,

Kidz Bop Kids,"I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place
I was lookin' for somethin' I couldn't replace
I was runnin' away from the only thing I've ever known

And like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, now I ain't lookin' back
And the seeds I've sown, savin' dimes
Spendin' too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left, I want to go
Who says you can't go home? It's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million mile of memories on that road

Every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, who says you can't go home?

I've been there, done that, now I ain't lookin' back
It's been a long, long road, feels like I've never left
That's how the story goes

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go

Kidz Bop Kids,"(Ooh, ooh, sweet love, yeah)

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please

This clock never seemed so alive

On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat

Fifty miles to go
And she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year, she had a lot on her mind
And she didn't pay attention, she was going way too fast

Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel, take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go, so give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on, Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock

And for the first time in a long time she bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life, I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus take the wheel, take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own

I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

We'll play jacks and uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside

And the sexy lady next to you, you come too

And then it hit me, standin' outside of heaven
Waitin' for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a new comer and too uncool

Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need holiday like lady who sung, ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two ton's too

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphone's
And they wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here, can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, pass the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid

And out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, 'less it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say

'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
The audience ain't fazed, they ain't gonna clap
And they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
'Cause they've been waitin' since ten to see the lights get dim

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they wanna show, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standin' in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't gettin' along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are grown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that""

And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performin' for me
Like, ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphone's
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you are what you say you are",Superstar

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
But I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do, why I do

As I turn out the light I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight 'cause

What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray a lot to justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie, live a lie

And you take your time and you stand in line
Well, you made your bed, I'm in mine

Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar bill

Kidz Bop Kids,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please don't go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause it's trouble if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, please don't go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

Romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes

I mean after all the things we got into
And yo, I know there are some things that you ain't told me
And yo, I did some things, but that's the old me

And now you wanna give me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies

I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted

I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it

Kidz Bop Kids,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?
What if, what if, if today was your last day?

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you're never living twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are

So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

Where the West was all but won
All alone, smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?"" He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you when everything was falling apart?
All my days were spent by the telephone that never rang
And all I needed was a call that never came
To the corner of 1st and Amistad

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late, you found me, you found me

Losing her, the only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not and who I wanna be
No way to know how long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late, you found me, you found me!

The early morning, the city breaks
And I've been calling for years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve taking all I want!

She tags along

But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?

So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight

But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days

Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the hater, what's up, Bobby Ray

So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this hit
So here I stand, and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

Kidz Bop Kids,"You're at your job working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a bunch of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, two thirty pm
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
And you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Kidz Bop Kids,"When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry
And yell at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it

And my momma swore that
She would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

And you're doing your best to avoid me

I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me

Oh I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me

I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side

The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love then fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me

I don't know what to say since a twist of fate

Now, now

That's why they play my songs on so many different dials

We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
No, though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does
I listen to my favorite song
It's playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess

Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

We'd listen every day to radio head
And when it was my birthday you bought me some balloons

Used to eat your favorite ice cream and hang by the pool
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned on one day id be losing you

In another life I would be your girl

Saw you downtown singing the blues
Its time to face the music I'm no longer your muse

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I begged, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Kidz Bop Kids,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you hold my hands and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees, were far too weak
To stand, in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew, all the things you'd say
They were never true, never true and the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire, to the rain
Watched it pour as I, touched your face
Well it burn while I cried 'cause I heard it
Screaming out your name, your name

When I sit, with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever, you and me
Together nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you

They were never true, never true and the games you'd play

Screaming out your name, your name

I set fire, to the rain
And I threw us, into the flames
When I felt something died 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I'd wake up by the door
That heart you hurt must be waiting for ya
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for ya

Kidz Bop Kids,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could cry
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can be addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you passed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low

Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke, inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in it's cage

I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all

To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me

And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a smart girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a smart girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, you need to slow down
Going thirty-eight, man you need to chill out
Mow your own lawn and sit right back down
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to the layers there, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

Oh, downtown, downtown (downtown)
Downtown, downtown
Oh, she has her arms around your waist (oh)
With a balance that could keep her safe (Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
Of the leather seat under your legs
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards

What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl

I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, ooh, somewhere in the corner over here just where I wanna

I ask myself what am I doing here?

And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand
That I'll be here (ooh)
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends

His hands are in my hair, he looks across the room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall, and handsome as well
He's so good but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (ah ah) (ah ah)

Hanging out with you all night
Turning it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories (follow) follow you around

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven hanging out and thinking we were slicker
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old
Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life
I hope I have children for me?
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me

Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while, he said
Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely
Ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

Run, run, lost boy, they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand and ever since that day

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose 
And two eyes made out of coal 
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day 

There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found 
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around 

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me 

Thumpetty thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go 
Thumpetty thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow 

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun 
Now before I melt away"" 
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square 
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

Frosty the snowman, frosty the snowman

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop 
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler ""Stop!"" 

Frosty the snow man had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying, ""Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day""

Kidzup,"El camino que lleva a Belén
Baja hasta el valle que la nieve cubrió
Los pastorcillos quieren ver a su Rey,
Le traen regalos en su humilde zurrón

Yo quisiera poner a tu pies
Algún presente que te agrade Señor,
Más tú ya sabes que soy pobre también,
Y no poseo más que un viejo tambor

Back in your grace where I belong
Tonight I'm sleeping in my own bed
With my blue tick feather pillow underneath my head

I feel the wheels on sixty five 
I don't know when, felt so alive
Eight more miles 
Eight more miles and I'll be home

Since I've been gone everything's changed
There's been two weeks of steady rain
And the dogwoods bloom, pink and white
And that damp smell of new cut grass is everywhere tonight

Sweet sunny sound, I never knew
Just how much I could miss you
Eight more miles 
Eight more miles and I'll be home

I crossed the Rockies on a silver train
I've walked from Burghan in a pouring rain
I met with strangers I came to love
And I've gotten drunk with Chieftains in a Dublin hotel pub

And I dearly love these memories

Kieran Kane,"His daddy said when he was a baby
He was impossible to hold
He'd fuss and fight and then he'd giggle all night
Terrify the whole household

But he'd listen to his bedtime stories
He believed what he was told
About gypsy camps, saddle tramps
And rainbow gold

He had about a million questions
Liked to drove everybody wild
He'd ask them stuff that was just too tough
They all told him, ""hush up child""

So it came as no surprise
When he left his home so young
Looking for some kind of paradise
I don't know what else he could have done

He was a scholar
Though he never really went to school
He stood amazed at the world's ways
And he followed the golden rule

He knew a little bit about everything
He could pretty much guess the rest
And he always seemed to know what you mean
If you took him in your confidence

Now most people run around in circles
But he ran a real straight line
The only thing wrong was that before too long
He left everyone who loved him behind

So it came as no surprise
When he left his home so young
Looking for some kind of paradise
Looking for something that he hadn't already done

Well he got to be hard to keep track of
Everybody was a little confused
And then one time the old grapevine
Whispered the strangest news

Now maybe he didn't mean to do it
I understand it if you've got your doubts
But I got a good idea that the coast was clear
And he figured he'd just bust on out

Now friends I'm not saying that it was a good thing
I'm not saying that it makes much sense
I just know that he was the kind to cross every line
Jump every single last fence

So it comes as no surprise
That he left his home so young
Still looking for some kind of paradise
The fool thought he had to go all the way to kingdom come

The only thing that I really wonder about now
Keeps running across my mind
If he ever caught his breath between his birth and death

If he ever caught his breath between birth and death
I swear I don't know where he ever found the time

Some kind of paradise",Some Kind of Paradise
Kieran Kane,"I don't want nobody, better off alone
I'm sworn to independence and my heart is made of stone

I've been singing along when I watch the way you walk
I've got to do something 'bout you.

I've got this (place/life) of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard, got no time for you
But I whiskied up my coffee cup
I'm sitting here trying not to call you up
And it's getting to where I don't know what to do
Something 'bout you.
Something about you like distant thunder

I can say I ain't been warned
But there's no shelter to crawl under
That's ever gonna save me from this storm.

There's something 'bout you

Drinking whiskey for the pain just
Another good ol' boy headed home

Seems to take a part of me

Well I cry when I have to
And I lie when I can
But I die a little slower

Got a guitar full of blues
And a one way ticket for my remedy
It's the same ol' lonesome song
I've been singing all night long
Hey, porter, are we out of Tennessee
Well I cry when I have to
And I lie when I can
But I die a little slower

Well every year I take this train
To Alabama in the rain
When I get that lonesome feelin' in my bones
I never get to Birmingham
But gettin' there ain't the plan

We had too misery, too much fun
Back then I guess either one would do
For awhile while I was loving you
The stars were brighter and the river ran deeper
The wind was warmer and the whiskey sweeter
Me, I was learning how
Much a believer can do
For awhile while I was loving you
I loved you tender, I loved you wild
Like a fatherless devil, like a motherless child
Lord when you left me, it felt like you cut me in two
For awhile while I was loving you
When I think of it now it's all like a dream
I lived in a world that was not what it seemed
I was believing that all of my dreams had come true For awhile while I was

"Kierra ""KiKi"" Sheard","Whenever I had the nerve to think that I had outgrown my teacher
Or I was living too good to listen to the preacher
You'd make it so that I would realize my disillusion
Then I'd have to re-evaluate some things, oh I

At one time, I was truly a circumstantial kind of praiser
Only when things were going good, I'd lift my voice in worship
Forgetting when all of the chips were down, who faithfully
Stayed around and helped me out, Lord, I don't know how?

At times I lost sight of my faith
At times I tried but I found it hard to wait on You
Many times I have taken things in my own hands
And messed up bad, so here I am singing

This is me, in my entirety
This is me, a person saved by grace
Humbly, confessing, with You I'm something
But without You I'm nothing, Lord

This is me, so plain and ordinary
This is me, minus everything fancy
Placed simply here to give You praises
And give honor to Your name

Through trials, You mold me I'm forever a work of art in progress
Though I don't always seem to see it, yes, it does manifest
It's just so evidently no one can deny that You're the One
Working through me, so I can be what You called me

With thoughts of faith, I read Your word and boldly claim my blessings
And with my whole heart I will worship You for simply being

At times, I tried but I found it hard to wait on You

This is me, minus everything fancy
Placed simply here to give You praises
And give honor to Your name

I pray that You forgive me for the times I
Couldn't take at Your word, word, Lord
I am willing to give my everything
Everything to please Thee

Lord, Your grace is more than sufficient
And as for Your will for me, I accept it
And who I am in You, I'm confident and I believe
Please hear me, I come to Thee

Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend

We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose

I wish I was an artist, so that I could paint a picture
Of how I feel, how I feel today, today
My love has no walls on either side,
That makes my love whiter than white,
I'm in the middle, no and I can't hide,
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know,
How glad I am

Kiki Dee,"Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that is real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
And if its quite alright
I need you baby

I love you baby
Trust in me when I say its okay

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you

Kiki Dee,"There's lightning's flashing in my mirror,
Thunder's rolling up behind.
Big blue clouds are going to roll in
Full of tears to make me blind.
I can't let his memory catch me.
I can't stop to cry no more.
I'm just running down the highway,

One jump ahead of the storm.
One jump ahead of the crying,
One jump ahead of his cold deceiving arms.
One jump ahead of the lying,
One jump ahead of the storm.
One day I looked on the horizon,

I saw his love just wouldn't last.
Before my mind was torn to pieces.
I had to leave and get out fast.
So I slipped out of his power.
I saw my chance and got me gone
Before the rain could start to falling.

One jump ahead of the storm.
One jump ahead of the crying,
One jump ahead of his cold deceiving arms.
One jump ahead of the lying,
One jump ahead of the storm.
One jump ahead of the storm.

And you really want to get somewhere
And you're thinking nothing's going to get you there
It's important to remember that you're free to go anywhere
Take your chances and let the change take you there
Sometimes it takes one step at a time
When that straight line makes you blind
And sometimes it takes a one step
It's not easy never easy
When you know you're gonna have to change
Your direction find yourself another way
Just remember what you're leaving
It is something that you had to go through
Don't be sorry there's something better waiting for you

And you won't find another way around it

Well it shortens the range of your vision
So you can't even see your hands
And it stands on one leg and just listens -
Don't talk ''cause it understands.

Over the hill, to set you free
You need help, hold on now
Gonna save you if you wait for me.

When it moves it'll make no sound
But you'll know what it is when it hits you

Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the street the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

Nine to five, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by; it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind, and they never give you credi
It's enough to drive you crazy, if you let it

They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn, and it's all gonna roll your way

Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

Nine to five--they've got you where they want you
There's a better life and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his pocket",Nine to Five

Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me, say it
Don't be shy, don't delay it

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
It's hard to say you wanna play but that's okay
Yes, I will stay with you for a little while

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me, say it
Don't be shy, don't delay it

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me

Yes, I will stay with you for a little while

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it

Kill Your Idols,"

At age 41, the king was dead
It wasn't the beginning or the end
Shouting for his freedom
He was silenced again
Maybe for the last time
The government
Just couldn't stand
To see their morals questioned
Another example of non freedom of speech
""he needs to be silenced""
In 1962 he plead guilty
To the lies of the state
After years of urging rebellion
He moved out west
A peaceful existence?
I don't think so
Retreated, lost and beaten
He sunk into depression
Losing battles to bottles
No money for bills
And no will to live
New years 1965 is when he collapsed
And the bottle toook his life
At age 43 he died alone and broke
With nothing but his family
A physical existence can be erased
But true legends never die
And where were his friends
When the end took him away?
No where to be found he gave it
A name and direction ""rock and roll""
End: I hope its true that when we die
We can look back on what we have done
Because I think Alan Freed would be glad to know
That the rebellion still carries on
Whenever someone raises their middle finger
And goes against the norm
I hope he knows that he didn't die in vain
Its not goodbye, just goodnight

The basic instructions before leaving earth
The basic instructions before leaving earth
The basic instructions before leaving earth

Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
I loved doing right but I was trapped in hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears, but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying, plus the praying
I didn't like staying 'cuz of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties

That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up lookin' at loot, butt, and thighs
Durin' the service, he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored, and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon, but never followed men
'Cuz if you do your brain is more hollow than

Space Oblivia, or The Abyss
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave, was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemned the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs

But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a Genie
No hocus pocus 'cuz I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet

Those who sit home, or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide

The basic instructions before leaving earth
Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

I strolled through the books of job to unfold
And open Bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to Heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the Bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take

I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom

Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome

I prophesied to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation, the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin' evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus

Killah Priest,"Guns, shootouts and crack sales
Black males who pack jails, trapped in hell
No peace, cold streets, surrounded by po-lice
This whole week, buildings with no heats
No lights, the gas pipes the snow leaks
Dog fights and lowlife throw dice the whole night
Thieves, creepin
In the midnight evenings, saw through the misty regions
Go to your house, take a vial for the demons
Moon in, the lunar eclipse
Prophets stand in the midst of the seven candlesticks
I can't take it, beauty that was once sacred
Is now gettin facelifts, fake tits, and fake lips
Cold embraces
Memory erases, from the slaveships
My princess, I used to spot her from a distance
Holdin my infant, burnin incense
The moment intent, for her to step into my wife tents
Now we step in pre-sents, for your ebony prince
The small of frankencense once treated like a pharoah
With royal apparel, annointed with myrrh and aloe
We used to wallow, amongst the mallows
We had herd sheep and cattle, now we battle
Used to pass over Brooks of Qe'ron
Towers of Lebanon, the pool of Gechron
We used to sing songs, upon Mount Hebron
How is gold turned to bronze, and shhh
How is gold turned to bronze
We was the wisest and the richest, now we turn to snitches
Women turn to bitches, in the time of harvest
We was the smarteest, worshipped Wisdom like the Goddess
Now we act retarded, forsook the Wisdom of the Fathers
We use to have a thousand flagons of wine
In Palestine there would drink Ballentine
And raise up in the violent mind
We used to have a hundred measures of oil, eighty measures
Of wheat and barley, we live Godly
Listening to Bob Marley, before the devils robbed me
Chasin us through the African safaris

From Then Till Now
What goes up must come down
What goes down comes back around again
Where it all began, began, began, began

What goes up must come down
What goes down comes back around again
Where it all began, began, began, began

Singin holy anthems, lampin with all
My handsome grandsons, hair long as Sampson
Inside my gold mansion, they used to wear purple Pampers
But now we Black Panthers, some are actors and dancers
It's funny how the dollar bill have my seeds holler for meals
Mother swallow a pill, roads seem hollow but still
Grab a bottle to heal, it's like a noose
Of seventh seal over Brownsville
What's the difference between the ghetto and death row?
I'm trapped up with cleptos, the tec blow
I'm left in seft low, where the cries echo
And echo and echo and echo and echoes
From the Crystal City, near Getti
Children used to grow on lillies, now they roll up Phillies
But the pyramids of Cheops, is my weed spot
Sometimes I eavesdrop in the books of Enoch
We went from studying epistles of Paul
Beneath a waterfall, rubbin crystal balls
But now we spray paint initials on the wall
On the wall spray paint initials on the wall

now I roll his dead planet  head bandaged  
sent through the god's commandment  feel me.. 
I move through the dark rages  and won't stop until your ?  
until your bleedin'  until you stop breathin'  
giving careers a severe beatin'  for emceeing  
it's something that I don't take lightly  how the fuck you ever fight 
me, 
to a duel, I drool, before I break through, then I drag emcees, 
beat um' down to their knees, grab their necks and squeeze!, 
till there's no life left, they lifeless, they micless, 
what a crisis, I give them a good nights rest, 
I break they biceps, and triceps, thighs and necks, 
breast area, is the best area, before I bury ya, 
I make sure that you never, ever, ever, ever, try that shit no more, 
know what I'm sayin', (word is bond), no ambition, 
put you in that fucked up condition, leave you with your own 
conviction, 
shit was non-fiction, now you in a state of non-fiction, 
make you beg for mercy, if you ever approach me, I blow your head off, 
when I talk, chop off your arms, and bash your head in, 
you know where this shit is headin', for a dead-end, 
stop your sweatin', like Otis Reading, got your pants wettin', 
snuck up on ya a wedding, at your honeymoon, turn that shit into doom, 
turn your rap cassettes, into your a fucking caskets, you god damn 
bastards, 
lyrics I mastered, rhymes burns like acid..

They made a braid to grave, ceremonies, from religious cults, 
half man and half goat, tomorrow hopes, based on the horoscopes, 
we followed goats, our nose and hella smoke, 
fire breathin' dragons, I rubbed the gold lantern, 
to the see the future, through the crystal ball, 
the triple walls of fisher wants to miss the fall, 
offence, see the coffin, often, fell at the doorstop, 
coughin, I heard the pipe organ (cough), saw some men of a white 
origin, 
I saw Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush, 
bare foot, sucking from the titties of a wolf, 
upon the braisen altar, 6 men offer they only daughter, 
splashing holy water, I ran for the, camcorder, 
now I play with curses, I roam the Earth's surface, 
snatching purses, allergic to catholic churches, 
what's the purpose, religious worship, is worthless, 
I visit ancient sanctuaries, where the saints were married, 
but now they buried 'cause of Satan's fury, I faced the jury, 
held in court, like Christ nailed to a cross, confront my knowledge, 
like Christ in front of Pontius Pilot, days are violent, 
standing in a haunted palace, the government wants my wallet..

Killah Priest,"(Are you trying to tell me that you will fight against me?) 
Oh you will win that too
For if you fail to silence me  you know what I will do

(What will you do physician?) 
I will go among the people  
And try to answer the questions that burn in their hearts 
The questions that I've asked myself  for all my life 
Wherever I've wandered in the world  and which were answered for me 
By a dying man  I will wear the clothes of a slave 

And kick the sandles from my feet, and speak to the wives 
As they fry their fish before their mud huts by the river 
To the porters on the docks, to the smiths by their belows 
To the slaves under the yolks, and I will say",Intro

Curiosity seekers biblical preachers historians
Ritual believers scholars teachers spiritual leaders
High priests generals sergeants and them rude captains
Lieutenants lower your gimmicks I'm the hip-hopper
That'll rock to fill a opera acapella locked cellar
Watch hell-ah, freeze over take you lower break you bold
Constrict to hit you like fingertips in your soul
Put whiskey in your soda or vodka
Chop you with a blade made of copper
Kick your head off like a soccer, brawl
Raw alcohol and it's over, arrest over in October
Punch a hole through your solar plex, and it's over!
I mark X on your chest it's over, and bury the dead
Ain't gonna be no rest

Just pretend, watch me blow like the dust in a gust of wind
Flow with the rush when I adjust the pen take you
Miles and miles and miles leave you at the river of the Nile
Now deliver the vials, fat, found in the pile in the stack
Books that were took, take a look, back
As I take you further high into the sky
Where your eyes like vision surprise then dive back
Vision buildin' the bombs, upon you peons
Knowledge you crazy Knowledge we be goin' off!
Now you lost tossed in confusion, saw an illusion
Of the car that started cruisin'
Actual day mathematics were raised to his attic
What's the weight of a flame, state your name
But he was afraid of the height, glazed at the light
Strayed, couldn't stay for the flight
Ran to his book of rhymes, took up some time
For the brother to hook up a line
As if he had a fishing rod, but my mission is God
Science I be dishin' out be hard
Deep in his eyes, contacts, plus saw beyond that
Saw the brother couldn't respond back
Tried to rhyme after me to hold the weight
But the science done drive dem niggas shoulder blades down
Let's take a trip travel through the mind
And played a trick when he unraveled the rhyme
Bloodthirsty no mercy when I bomb no thinkin' emotions
Sick him with potions that I've developed
To make the body swell up like venom
Once I'm in em then I skin em and skull em
After that I call em, back from the essence
Who the fuck want more lessons? It's over!

Know what I'm sayin'? It's over
The dead bury the dead, it's over
Your career, it's over
All you wack M-C's (finish em up) it's over
Finish em up

The blast, burns back into elements
Development of gas around the mass of the Earth
A hundred and ninty six million
Now a hundred and forty thousand miles are occupied
By people causin' housin'
Over this the mind was just browsin'
Thought I was warm coats, I dispose hope
Of the focus and roast energy toward the enemy
Now in burnin' G's, chemically enforce infinity
Attack, third eye, what occured my, vocal form into a storm
Went blaow burnin' but left him in the crowd wonderin'
Now you wonder on many thoughts you ponder fell asleep
Tryin' to seek the beyonder while I would ponder microphones
Recitin' poems, strikin' domes to your frightening moans, of horror!
Speakin' evil Hebrew from the Torah
Slammed the mic it turned to a serpent, open the curtains
Saw things he couldn't interpret, destroyed the Earth
Fill it with gunpowder, came build sun power
Rebuild it in one hour
Then revealed it through a sunflower shared the shower
Showin' the power of the North Messiah eyes on fire
Water oxygen you can't comprehend to these strange doc-trines
Stop the winds, beyond the orbits of Dionne Warwick
With no broomsticks and magic tricks is this
Return of the Iron Maiden
Stomp your corny ass like the Raven
What's the matter? You frostbitten, you lost your mittens
It seem you wanted to cross to smitten

KP  Killah Priest  Iron Sheek  
These times we gotta take one step.. forward. 
Put one foot in front of the other  my brother.. 
Yo  check this out  

Early natives related to throwns of David  
Captured by some patriots  and thrown on slave ships  
They stripped us naked  while they wives picked they favourite  
Lives were wasted, in the hands of the hated, 
Driven from the garden [garden], now we starvin' in the martyring Sodom, 

They call it Harlem, wordly problems got us at the bottom, 
The Earth crisis, and the righteous grab their ice picks, 
Seekers like us for our rices, I stay in ciphers, 
Our live is, connected to second son of Isaacs, which had a tight grip, 

On the heels of his brother, revealed to his mother, 
The elders who served the younger, words heard in thunder, 
Down from under, rose and fled to grow in hunger, now it's cold in summer, 
To slow your slumbers, behold a number, 600, 6 and 3 score, 

The same as he saw, who ate his heat raw, in the time before, 
They climbed aboard a dinosaur, information held behind the doors, 
We came from the atmosphere, the physical trapped us here, 
Then they gave us crack and beer, in the back of the stairs, 

Please adapt your ears, add or subtract the years, and form the unwise, 
And watch the sunrise from sunset, none-slep, one flesh, one breath.. 

[Chorus] 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 

Devils morale, they caught us playing with the gold marbels, 
We wrote novels, now we live life in the bottle, before the devil sold me, 
To the unholy, because my father told me, 
I lived like a monks of lowly, lowly, but lowly?, 

The president just ordered the navy to hit the borders of Haiti, 
Slaughtered babies from the waters of Ufraeties, 
Maybe they send germs that polluted our sperm, 
And made us live with circumcize in the serpent eyes, 

And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies, 
But in the halls of Farrow the walls are narrow, 
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom, 
Now free them, lets feed um', feed um'... 

They took the first book of Jacob to Jamaica, 
Promised us 40 achers and a mule, treated like an animal, 
Understand the jewel, brought to the 50 states, 
Deuteronomy 28, verse 68, it all relates, 1555 is when we first arrived, 
We tell jokes wish um' get high, and watch the fish fry... 

[Chorus] 

One Step... 
One, One, Step, Step 
One, One, Flesh 
One, One, Step.. 
One, One, Breath... 
One.. Step....

Cops out the precincts, and words was bricks
We buildin' projects to pyramids, evil kid

Stalkin' through this nature, the heaven raise ya

Speak no evil to all I see, tappin into the

Cheddar in error, slave mental death to the treasure

It's about to sign off, some shit you can read in ? block spin?
But make no mistake, devil players, penetrate with your smarts
Redrum mania reincarnate to another shape
Bomb flashes, what can happen, new jack-in
Your rappin' ain't the magnum so when he cought up to half these
Niggaz even stole the soul of the streets in motion

Expand your mind
Seek and you shall find

Walkin through the penile glands, like it was a unfathered man
Knowledge is the key to the mind which is a mysterious doorway
Through a long dark hallway
Use your conscious as a compass to avoid bein' conquered
By nonsense, use your subconscious as a map
Once it's time to head back use your food for thought
And leave bread tracks
Now we can see the third eye, swift as you burn fly
You need common sense as a detour
Up ahead there lies three doors for you to see more
You might have to meditate to the soft melodies from a keyboard
Understandin' is your flashlight
It reflects the windows to your past life
No psychiatric's could raid you from off the mattress
As you fall deeper, and it's hypnotized you better read my lips
Cause that's the guide, out the hallways of negative
Which is always competitive, therefore
You must never let it live

Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind, seek and you shall find
Expand your mind, seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind",Tai Chi
Killah Priest,"Love of my life 
You are the love  of my life 
You are the love in my life  my life 
You are the love in my life  in my life 
You are the love in my life  my life 
With God control  I take a photo of the globe 
Like a space probe  let your tape roll to roll 
My ways of life shine purple rays of light 

Ways that are right take long days and night 
Then I enter wind  there's no interfere 
No sense of care  tense at the prayer 
Then we exalt like ci-ties of Leba-nese 
Drop with heaven-ness, must be heaven sent 
Left with evidence, ever since you left 
Seventh prince, and the pleasant scent of sweet smells 
Exhale, I'm as deep as a well 
Watch Priest prevail by fear and love 
Lifts off through the air like a dove above 
The star circuits, where Allah is perfect 
It lies like an olive tree, woman follow me 

Through the galazies, just acknowledge me 
We'll walk the calorie across the Sea of Galilee 
I give you rubies, for your beauty, you look 
As fine as jewelry, I chose the finest your highness 
I chose the finest your highness 
You see my instructions, are not silver 
In knowledge forever then choice gold 
For wisdom is better than rubies 
And all the things that may be desired 
Are not to be compared to it 
Our wisdom, will dwell with punics 
You're my one and only, during our holy matrimony 

Attract my homies, subtract the phonies 
What it manifold, make a man explode 
Love episode, give me rest when I'm old 
So clear and unbefouled, plus runnin wild 
Caught you as a child, brought you under clouds 
Never earthquakes when I'm home from work late 
Never forget your birthdate, I love you 
Damn your understandin have me hunger like a famine 
Prepare for landin.. for landin.. for landin.. 
Abortin the River Jordan like a RZA recordin

I`m set it off. Yea, yea, ya shitted.
Ya in some shit now, son.

It`s on now, mothafuckas can suck my dick.
I`m back! Fuck that shit!
Ready to eat niggaz up, beat they ass and e`rything, son.
I`m a prove this shit, right here.
Me and my nigga. What!?

[Killah Priest]
The emperor, chief sinister, street minister
guaranteed in two bars to finish ya
React like a cat when he arches back
Give a fake rapper a heart attack, once I start to rap

I`m a vocalist, nigga, supposed to rip
Last Poet`s told me this, hit ya in ya head wit my explosive fist
Then I finish ya off with my tremendous horse-kick
What now, nigga? Look at ya, talk shit

Can`t do it, 'cause you ain`t got no teeth in ya mouth
And I know ya just tired of me, beatin ya out
Ya trained all year, in a karate class
It took one second, to put yo` ass in a body bag

From a shotty blast, I walk up in ya club and ya parties don`t last
I like to pop shit, don`t get me started
I slap y`all mothafuckas like y`all little kids in kindegarten
Squeeze yo` head till yo` kidneys harden

Now watch this, I`ma call my whole mothafuckin squadron
And tell niggaz to just start robbin
'Cause y`all niggaz is fucked up
and Brooklyn niggaz is really ready to get ya

I know how to hit ya, and cut ya open
But don`t worry, 'cause I`ma stitch ya, with a rusty screwdriver

Niggaz bop yo` heads to this, real shit
Call up yo` clicks to this, it`s realness
You feel this in yo` streets and village
Spare that new shit, Priest killed it
why! Niggaz bop yo` heads to this, real shit
Call up yo` clicks to this, it`s realness
You feel this in yo` streets and village
Spare that new shit, `bus killed it

Yo, yo, yo
Yo I`m a Macabeast MC and I possess the ability
To run at top speed without bendin my knees
I destory shit, pin-point asteroids in orbit

Then, hurl niggaz thousands of miles an hour, towards it
Fuckin heathen, wrap my hands around ya neck region
Then I start squeezin `til ya stop breathin
You weaklins is playin tug-of-war wit ya tongues

I knock the teeth out ya gums and suck the breeze out ya lungs
Hit ya wit a blow your physical frame could never sustain
You`ll probably never walk ever again
Nigga, you think you rhyme sick? I leave you lyin stiff

Pull you behind my horse til I break ya spine, bitch
Stop cryin bitch, before I hit ya wit the Iron, bitch
You can`t rhyme bitch, the one triple nine`s mine bitch
The pain`ll make ya voice change octaves

From low-pitched to high-pitched, every hour we kill a hostage
We judge MC`s by they lyrical fitness
And punish DJ`s for puttin corny stickers on they mixes
Smack the stripper bitches for askin for our autograph and pictures

You`ll be scared to leave the club wit us
You scratch my back, I`ll scratch your`s bitch
I`ll eat ya salt-fish, if ya suck my sausage
I got an atomic sub, armed wit a sub-atomic scud

Ready to spill ya crimson-colored blood
The four horsemen on the back of four quadropeds
Puttin four hoof prints on ya foreheads, mothafuckas!

The prophecies of a poor man end on a train
Take his last breath
Slumps over drops his last bit of change
A mother pacing by her window pane

Staring hopeless at the gentle rain
When the messenger returns telling her
That her child was slain
She reaches for his picture frame

Open up the good book read the scriptures
And sighs his name
The skies full of flames
Streets are gothic

Twelve niggaz lay dead in front of their projects
Reminding D`s of a classic mob hit
Bitches gossip, about they men being targets, or suspects
Niggaz in the lab taking golden seal

For tomorrows drug test
Scared niggaz hugging they techs
Don`t want to get plugged next
Outside there`s a bloodfeast

We all product, faced with hard luck
Since the wrath of God struck
Now we like ""Yo Tone let me borrow a buck""
He like ""Yo what the fuck""

Niggaz was born to be skeletons
Or was it the curse of this dark melanin
When I die will I open my eyes in Hell again
With these jealous men

Lord forgive me but I smell a gin
On the lips of winos
Sent a plaque turned `em all into Albinos
With horns coming from their foreheads like Rhinos

Read it in my last testament and my hidden scrolls
See my icon straight faced with a torn robe
A beard and some cornrows
The whole globe hears when I perform my shows


[Chorus: x2]
We go from hard times to part-times
From part-time back to hard times
That`s the start of crime
'Til the day we see the father shine
Light on us, trying to warn us
We play the corners

[Killah Priest]
I visit monasteries
Where dons were buried
Approached the bench with teary eyes
Tryin' to con the jury

Christ said those of you without sin, cast the first stone
Those of you without ends, blast the first chrome
Is it the prophecies of Deuteronomy
That drove us to this poverty?

Trapped with starvin' seeds
Fightin' for sovereignty
Cold nights make the toddler freeze
Blood over my wallabies

Raining mahogany
Here`s a dollar for the trees
We worship weed like idolatry
Silly bitches with conniving thoughts

Sticking knives and folks
Don`t understand what it`s like to be a black man in court
Niggaz up screamin' all night
Complaining that their handcuffs are too tight

Kicking on the cell till they cut out the lights
It`s like a curse
Walk besides white women they start holding they purse
I just ask you for the time bitch

What you got anyway? Some of the Indians turf
The Beauty that once flowed from the Nile
Like the Moses child
The hand that writes is a good as the hand that holds the plow

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
Some say the spirit of a dead angel lies within me
Look in my eyes, they`re empty
Poverty stricken beaten with the rod ol' envy
Lurking through the shadows of death

Dragging my wings, saw the image of a beast
Ram, dragon and queen, heard the bragging of kings
Whose laughter was as bitter as a scorpion sting?
Forced in the ring with idiots so many cliques

Letting out automatic clips
A dead lady combing the hair of a bastard bitch
I spit graphic shit you ain`t hear half of it
From my fucked up marriages

To dealing with miscarriages
From drinking with savages
Driving hazardous
I`m here today to meet the man from Nazareth
Where`s the pastor? Show me where that chapter is

Killah Priest,"When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

I heard a wise man once say, ""Thugs pray""
But still slugs spray from the double barrels
Fallin’ pharoahs over the graves of the sleepin’ prophets
Release the pain from the deepest closet

It's like a secret that we keep in bondage
Mothers weapin’ from they projects
First it be that soul, send to haunt the empty halls
Memories painted on the wall

Like The Lamb's Blood on the doors, of the black Hebrews
Nowadays the same people on subway trains sellin’ street news
A ghetto movie, with no sequels
But I still show you previews

That will free you, from your evil
An old man, cookin’ her-on, over hot tea spoons
Old G's are all evil, usin’ dope needles
Wearin’ fan parafanil's

We live in the black hole, where no one can hear us
The valley of the dry bones, without reflections in the mirrors
The world fearers, first make 'em feel us
Come on

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

The Solomon couldn't say it better
It's all vanity, and sanity
We come from broken families
My own pop's abandoned me, black becomely

The spirits of Lords upon me, I grew up hungry
Now we chase money and live grungy
The fears want me, to bring me to the hills of this country
So they can jump me, feel me up, in land and dump me

Damn right I said it bluntly
I ain't scared of none of y'all monkeys
At school my teachers used to flunk me
Hopin’ one day I turn to junkey

But only God can judge me, words of Makaveli
Black Israeli, hear me? Told you y'all niggas gonna feel me
Killah Priest AK Masada, sincerely yours

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

So check out my darkest secrets, my truest confessions
Come to you as a blessing, parental viewing in this aggression
Is advised, tune in to the wise, zoom in your eyes
Step up closer, to the light, like that child on Poltergeist

Wisdom be ultra right
Explosive to the sight, 3D, virtual reality
Verbal mentality, come with me
Load up your gun with me, run with me
Become one with me, this is channel three

High definition, ghetto TV, DVD
Cable networks, stick your fingers
In the bullet holes in my sweatshirt
Take it out and taste the blood, so you can see that its real
A View From Masada, give kids, chill

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

",When Will We Learn
Killah Priest,"[Killah Priest]
It's time..

I'm tied up in the basement, blindfolded by nine soldiers
With rare paintings and fine sculptures, they spoke blatant
Their nine's loaded, they put a gat to the back of the blind poet
I want to cry but I try and hold it, one of them notice
Crack me over the skull with a crime motive
They made a toast to my death, I rose to my feet
With the heat close to my flesh
May I say these last words to my enemies passing the Earth?
Laughing at my passion and merge, ""Ok, kill me if ya'll wanna""
Slay me and never play the corner, cold winters
You're all gonners, tell your momma call the coroners
You get me, and God gets you, it makes sense don't it?
In the heat of the moment

[Chorus x2: Killah Priest]
In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, ya'll know the deal

[Killah Priest]
After the sunshine there's rain, after the laughter there's pain
After my chapter there's flames, after the rapture the master shall reign
Shockwaves blacken the terrain, and man looks strange
Open the book, see I'm king, read my name, and see thy wings
Believe I changed, I went with the horse, slept at the pastor's door
Heard the whispers through my enemy's walls
Rode the elevator to the thirteenth floor
Console with Gandi, since God placed his hands upon me
I rose up commanding the army, demanding my laundry
Talk to monks, holding a pump, ya'll niggaz wanna roll, what ya'll want?
Shout at satan, shout at the pagans, cats wavin', one of the brave men
Priest

Chorus x2

[Killah Priest]
I know somewhere my assassins await, setting traps at my place
Phones tapped, all my actions are traced
I lay back strapped at the waist
Who's this bitch with a match in my face
I don't know, ""Don't smoke 'em, thank you""
Slipped somethin' in my drink with an ice cube
Nice move, bright jewels, she's with this white dude
She said ""I like you, I'm in the right mood,""
And she comes with a price too, but as the night grew
She saw the black heart, the Archangel Michael
My gats spark vital, her arms show track marks
Close the rival

Killah Priest,"[Intro: Killah Priest]
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to +Priesthood+
If you purchased this album from a store
Or you got a copy from a friend
You about to witness one of hip hop's greatest secrets
That the record industry tried to hide
Due to lack of promotion and scandalous intentions
Priest was forced to take his album underground
And now he will no longer suffer
Reviewing this album, you gotta ask yourself why
Look at every song, and I'mma let you decide
He is one of the greatest MC's, ever to roam this planet

[Killah Priest]
Father forgive me, it's the Henny or Remi
Or maybe it's the many of fame, this world planted in me
When I was just a child, I was misunderstood
Til I saw your finger in the cloud, I was picked from the hood
I was in the myst of a crowd, when shit wasn't good
Til I heard your voice out loud, then I lifted it good
Doctors wouldn't tell me, the teachers would often fail me
And for a grown child, that shit, just wasn't healthy
When the bitches hadn't dealt me, never planned to help me
But now I'm a man, I understand what's really wealthy
It's not about how much tuition you got in your bank
But it's bout how much ammunition that I got in my tank
Yeah, yeah, now y'all scarred 'cause I'm talkin revolution
What ya rather see me dead by a fuckin execution
If y'all probably go to bed, 'cause it's less confusion
All your see in yo head, is my electricution
But I'm comin back, and this time I'm strapped
And fuck +The Law+, 'cause I'm bustin my gat
And I'm wanted by y'all, and my niggas know that
'cause once they fire, my niggas shoot back
And straight up on some real shit, I'm a lyrical jewel
Ask a wall in the air, and pay ya spiritual dues
Fuck the B.A.'s, 'cause nigga suck a dick
And all ya rabbling backstab, I'm not fuckin wit
Aiyo fuck poppi' collars, I'd rather cock the revolver
And have ya momma cryin, while ya sister's watchin them dollars
I'm one of the best, next to 'Face and Jay, Nas, 'Pac and Poppa
You can say Priest or Masada, fasada, motherfucker, +Blackball Me+

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
+Blackball Me+, ya just +Blackball Me+
+Blackball Me+, motherfucker, +Blackball Me+

[Killah Priest]
So, fuck those critics, I ain't got no religious
What ya thought, ya act suspicious, but ya get it
So chill wit it, plus nothin of y'all, ever been in my shoes
Ya probably, play wit a doll, when I payin my dues
That's the type of shit that darkens my heart
Where was y'all motherfuckers when Marcus got shot?
Where was y'all when the guns sparked up my block?
Where was y'all when my sister, was coppin those rocks?
Where was y'all when Pooh fell in my arms?
I had to drag him out the buildin, when them niggas was gone
Where was y'all when that nigga, put a gun to my chest?
Pulled the trigger, but no fuckin bullets was left
What ya figure, that my life was filled wit happiness
Ya wrong, I tell you for real and not the fake stories
Ya can get mad and +Blackball Me+, motherfucker

[Outro: Killah Priest]
+Blackball Me+ (5X)
+Blackball Me+ niggas, +Blackball Me+
Ya know ya bad motherfuckers, +Blackball Me+, +Blackball Me+
+Blackball Me+, +Blackball Me+
I still come back, motherfucker
It's time, motherfucker
Now you left me to judge, fuckin critics
Monkey judge, fuckin wit a muthafuckin prison
'cause at the end I'mma see you redemption
Believe that, why tell the truth to Allah...
+Blackball Me+ motherfuckers...

[Movie Sample]
Many people feel haunted
By what they call evidence of evil forces in the world
They see genocide, senseless violence, plagues
And they blame demons, or the Devil himself
They believe that demonic spirits can actually possess a human body
And that only rituals of exorcism
Can lift the possessed from the darkest regions of the unexplained



",Intro (Blackball Me)
Killah Priest,"Up and down
Didn't I say niggas gotta come ready for more?
Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Ain't nuttin here, ain't nuttin you gotta say to that
Now what you gonna do about it? What you gonna do
about it man?
Bring it any day!

This is madness, niggas runnin up the block, duckin shots
Cop cars swervin, niggas squirtin, the ghetto's burnin
Hell's season, the soul's returnin
We live like crows and a hermit, searchin for a higher learnin
The fire's burnin, lightnin bolts comin down
Hittin both coasts, leavin niggas comatosed
That's why I wear the chrome close
And we'll all meet the omen in the moment of most
Runnin in churches with my gun, I'm nervous
Disrupt the service, ask the pastor, ""Where do I worship?""
My life is worthless, I done seen so many nights and murders
The enemy stuck a knife in Curtis
I wake up in cold sweat, grab my Tec, I'm hopeless
All my homies pullin on roaches of foul coaches
Or loud explosives, return to the hood like the child Moses
A bastard in a basket, my gat spit
Till the palbearers close the casket
And that's it, the end of the chapter
The beginnin of the next one
The resurrection, imperfection, after death come
The black son in the ghetto section
The light protect them from the iron weapon
This is madness

This is madness, this is madness

Mystic night beneath the cherry moon, we rarely move
Peace to the ghetto nation, three million population
Guns poppin Satan, feel our feather wings
Eloheim as we bury kings
Our fathers pumpin' garbage in their blood streams
The novel of Apollo, every thug thing
Blood, money and cancer inside a dope fiend
My hungry team sellin' drugs, Verazine got me feelin' buzzed
Ghetto breed felonies, my niggas face the judge
The witness tryin to place his mug, the D.A. tryin' to taste his blood
And the lawyers is the court employers, showin' fake love
The court system is 33 and 1 third of a mace and club
While niggas is still beefin' and tradin' the slugs
Who's to blame? I hear cats callin my name
Sayin, ""Please, don't fall in this game!""
We're all in a gang
It's like the ghetto, got me trapped with a ball and a chain
To them crack rocks I swallow, absorbed in my vein
Nightmares of bein shot, record in my brain
My neck and soul dropped and fall in the flames
Every night I wanna roll a Dutch, scared to sober up
I'm like a bird in the cobra's clutch
I'm like a bird in the cobra's clutch
This is enough

This is madness, this is madness

You bought this Proverb baby!

Every day I hear violent screams outside my window
I see black hearses followed by limos
On your forehead I see the devil's symbol
3 6's, do the arrhythmic of the witches
And Grand Wizard, can you withstand the blizzard?
I see prophecies unfold that was told by the prophets of old
Looked up, I saw the clouds in Heaven roll
Back like a gigantic scroll
UFO's came down to damage the globe
3 rolls, saw the lamb with blood on his robe
While the beast shove us in stoves
And the government swallow our souls
I'm gettin' drunk of a wild Irish rose
My brain's haunted, roll with much pain and torment
A fire like Elijah that came with the warning
Bodies being carried at the sound of the organ
Saw the skeleton, the rider of the Four Horsemen
Pull out my dick, chop off my foreskin
Take the blood and write down my four sins
On the side of Satan's coffin, I see angel's corpses
I start to gettin' nautious from demonic forces

This is madness, this is madness

Only 14, product of a broken home
Out late, tryin to tell me that you're makin your livin
Tryin to see how much weed you can take in your system
Indeed, take out the seeds, then he finished his sentence
Askin me what I believe, have I ever repented?
Type of shit niggas talk about when they get high
Passed out, hazy eye, lettin days go by
Bullshittin one another with the same old lies
Tryin hard not to show all that pain inside
Saw the clouds turnin black like an angel died
Preacher said you a curse if you don't pay your ties

The revolution, this is rebel music
The other day a young lady threw her baby of the roof an'
Six niggas died from homicide and drug shootins
My homey's mom just went of the loose end 
From drugs abusin, this is thug amusement 
Bloods and Crips, huggin the strips 
Lovin they clips, sittin on dubs in they whips
Folks, GD's and vice lords, when night falls
Black pimps and white whores, from the immortal words of Jeff Thor
To death do us all, the sets I recall, til we rest in the morgue
From the pilgrimage of Larry Huger, to the tribes of Judah

Can't argue 'cause God makes the test

Trying to fight the feeling but I was just like a victim
Caught up in the rhythm of dough I was spendin'
Drinking down venom, the bacardi and lemon
The bartender grinnin', the party's just beginning
And I was sent into it, it was probably endin'
I mean the stars, the cars, the cards that you charge
To the brauds that you meet at the bar, it's all a mirage
I even ignored my true calling from God
Hid like Jonah in the club with bottles of corona
Surrounded by models and owners, and cronic smokers
The ones that you find in a coma, play the corners
Gun holder sprayed the foreigners
But today I'm no longer, much stronger
Witness my song, 'cause

[Chorus x2: Killah Priest (singer)]
My life, money, girls and material things
In my life, it means a lot to a player when he's chasing his dream
My life, it takes a lot to turn a player around
My life, especially in the playa moment when he lays on the ground
(In my life)

[Killah Priest]
Taking straight shots of liquor, leave a spot on my liver
Bustin' shots at my niggaz praying cops come quicker
'cause the life I got, somethin' not to live for
My kid's 4' 5"", and 12, surviving hell
My nigga Boog died in jail, the rest of my niggaz crying bail
Laying in an iron cell, I tried going to church
But it seems like the Pastor keep molding a verse
Until my mom go in her purse
The Lord knowing I search, I needed therapy
My heart's beating heavily, I'm seeking heavenly
For the rest of me, my man says stay weeded, that's the recipe
Until the cops arrested me
My destiny is to leave a legacy, I don't have much
But if the Lord credit me, you'd see the best of me
I found a new life the day within the Bible page
While the popcorn's in the microwave, I hop on a tidal wave
I'm being stress free, I can do it if you let me
If I'm wrong then correct, or it just could be
Or it just could be

[Chorus x2: Killah Priest (singer)]
My life, money, girls and material things
In my life, it means a lot to a player when he's chasing his dream

[Killah Priest]
Since this record is nearly over, bring the song to it's closin'
Jahova, lights that novas over life and cultures
I'm seein' nights turn solar, ultra brightens the globe up
I roll up to niggaz with no luck, slow bucks
Spent, hold up, silly cops coppin' doughnuts from bakeries
Shootouts awaken the seeds, D's chasin' the thieves
In projects hoping to receive large checks
For their children, police and the mayor chillin'
While they're the biggest villians of them all
I'm building with the children by the mall
I hear the rumors saying ""Priest be on some other shit
Trying to unite the bloods and crips""
To show 'em how to overthrow this government
I start spazzin', talking about the mothership
Throwin' off my publicist and start talking about the Hebrew covenant
While I'm still thuggin' it, I keep it real, that's why they lovin' it
In my life...

[Chorus x2: Killah Priest (singer)]

Have you really understood what Priesthood means?
Royal Kings turn fiend chasing hood dreams
Bring it back, it ain't hard as things seem
I speak the facts as the tracks made the hood theme
Have you really understood what Priesthood means?
Royal Kings turn fiend chasing hood dreams

[Killah Priest]
Song of a rose, mass in a tinted window, they play my intro
I walk like I waltz in the road, instrumental
Have a nigga sentimental, statues and monumental
The kind that Ghengis Khan was sent to
Sorta like Islamic temples and castles with demonic symbols
My armors ripped too, Imma spit two
The promise that I give you to the virtue that's on my garment
I'm Godsent, my right hand raised, I'm honest, pay homage
I lay in garbage with the hiphoppers, ya'll think about it

[Killah Priest]
When King Tut closed his eyes, I opened up mine
Felt the pulse in my spine, I choked and I whined
I was sent here by God to bring hope to my kind
First words was a note I spoke in a rhyme
My album'll touch you like the death of Malcom
Comes in CDs, cassettes, internet, and volumes
I was raised by a certain column on my info
I know the CIA got 'em, they want me to stay at the bottom
But I rise to the top, why not? my glock, spies watch
But they can't do me nothing, because we kings
This my theme song, and this is how I sing

Preach the novel, sit upon a seat of marbel, teach the Gospel
Street apostle, found my name engraved deep in fossils
I spray bullets at you, eat your hollows
Make it hard for you to even swallow
You be that way until you reach Diablo
Bet your family's gonna weep tomorrow
Ya'll walk the path that the Reaper follows
Sorta like the cat in Sleepy Hollow
Ya'll get wacked, I pack a burner like the heat and charcoal
Build my castle like the Count Draco'
God forbid when I let the gat blow, my hat low
Despite a belief, the trap door, spinning webs with leads
Ya'll get clapped and that's that, with the rap flow

Yeah, breathe in, Priesthood
Let's do it...

[Killah Priest]
Slug out, never that, young dude, clever cat
Eat shit, smoke spliffs, get high, reminisce
Innocence, bulletproof, any one, pullin' through
Junior High, do it fly, fuck in grade Summer school
Comin' through, get me drunk, blunted too, every month
Hundred shoes, every son, wanted jewels, never front
Got older, hunger grew, watched most the younger fools
Squat out from the guns they usin', not close to the most of them
Quarter rolls, microphones, one, two, revolution
Sons due, evolution, in a rhyme, ghetto music
In the mind, 'cause I'm movin, in time, intwine
Lines all out of ideas, thoughts expose the road
Painted pictures, mask very clear, like a spear
Fallin' from the atmos, my raps soaked in the pages
Kids I play with, different flavors, instant paper
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
I just breathe, the breathe of life in the mics
Feel my notepads with sites, now, guide you like God did to Israelites
I just breathe, the breathe'll in whole tap
Into my cassettes, fate awakin' you, holdin' in like herb in your chest

[Killah Priest]
I'd rather spit it to it right, then a dome
Like a jewel in a throne, microphone, recite a poem
Hypotone, mellow out the ghetto route, track thugs meadow out
Crack blood devil house, gat slugs, here's your addict
Pushers of conceited habits, took us, look and seen me mad it
Cash laws, blast hog, gas talk in the hood
Black boars, burnin' wood, crack walls turnin' good
Nickel bags, crystal mag, blackout, semi' four
Black watch, ready for war, sasquatch, fantastic four
Blood, strength, through the Clan, wear the colors of our black
Love our mothers, love our dads, sister drug out on that glass
You ain't mad when they ain't sell refer, jump out the window, chasin' Jesus
Hunt me in the garbage, told me, he's a prophet
Used to recite scriptures, and dust, now our skin poppin'
Gems drop in '88, baby cake, first born
I'm crazy late, words long, worst one was '91

[Chorus 2X]

[Killah Priest]
Second son, I'm stressin' young, blesses come, record deal
Kept it real, tess my skills, '96, my third born
Word born, vicious like he held him tight, and mellow hobby
I'm the father and the author, change my name to Masada
First rhyme, search mine, first crime, I stole a ring
Sold it, soak in dreams, felt guilty but the feelin' passed
Learned to put, all my feelings in my past
Kids that had a thinking, took my books and bring
Gave you read, all these laws
Blow coasts, smoke spliff, old flicks, focused
Flip cake, chicks scrape, that's me, thick braids
Swift blade, in the pockets, sick days in the projects
Slick way, I'm the stocking cap, I just got in rap
Family, photo albums, gun, drugs, know the outcome
Book, sweater, picture very, wedding flicks, obituraries
Lyrics that be military, haunt you like a cemetery
Hahahah... breathe in

That's it, it's war
Priesthood, Priest
(Mother Earth was pregnant from third thing
Your in lock with it, I have tasted
the maggots of the man, I was no up in this
But I knew I had to rise above it all
Or drown in all shit)

Priest, Proverbs, hahaha
Y'all cats think I was just gonna come off, and I don't get none
Thought y'all wasn't hear from me again, right?
That's right baby, Killah Priest, Priesthood, Priest Stone

Know what I mean? Priesthood, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, this is Priest, yo, Killah Priest, Priest Stone, Priesthood
Back for good, know what I mean? Thought y'all wasn't gonna hear from me again
Now I gotta scream on everybody (family) everybody battlin'
Battlin' in the street, whatever, check this out, yo

[Killah Priest]
It's Priest standin' in his greatness, God's favorite
I rock the Star like King David, my Queens bath it
I walk past, they start wavin'
Each arm, a thousand bracelets, face it, I'm the greatest

Made women drunk from the royal fragrance
I rock the latest in fashion, my jewelry flashin'
In other countries, they can hear my magnums
When they blastin', I heard they sound like thunder clappin'

Hit you in your stomach, watch you start gaggin'
Who gives a fuck if you're platinum?
If you're lyin' in a wooden casket
For good, now that's Hood...

[Chorus]
Yo, every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess
Enemies lie down while I'm clutchin' my tech
It's on, the Priest, the Prophet, the King, the God
The sun, you see him quickly when I'm poppin' my gun
It's on...

[Killah Priest]
Thou shall fear me, only as thou'se been guilty
Feel me, sincerely yours, Priest, now industry tried to kill me
Before sat at tables, like the Savior at The Last Supper
Amongst nine rap lovers, three crack hustlers, with gats covered

Peep my last words, in the Proverbs, observe me
If you're worthy, I 'member your ass show
When y'all was wet and cold, I cover y'all with robes
Gave y'all flows, when y'all give y'all soul

I gave y'all flesh, covered y'all bones
Breathed in you, sat y'all in thrones
Now y'all betrayed me, I raised thee from babies
To y'all were grown men

For your birthday, I gave y'all your own pen
To write with, beware of vipers, and snakes and biters
I taught y'all about the depths of words and dark sentences
Now y'all don't remember shit, but try to mimic it

When I see my crown, just give me it, it's mine
Seek your own rhyme, it's on, seek your own rhymes, come on!

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
I lay rappers down, with the mac or the pound
Pop 'em, stretch 'em out with they backs to the ground
Leave 'em lost in the woods, gotta find them with hounds
My four five'll turn a nigga from fatigues to bow-ties, no lie

Put a nigga close by, the Most High
Or he's a Dream Catcher, the Indian myth, pick one
Semi or fifth, your shell get hit, ladies spell my shit
A-D-D, I-see-T, I-V-E, lick your lips, come try me

Contestants, hook 'em up to I.V.
In hospital, I pop pistols, fellas get ya hit like Hot Nikkels
Killah Priest, the Priest Stone, or High Priest, I pop three
Leave rappers in memory, the winner be me

We gon' do this, stay focused
Yeah, I feel it, uh-huh
Yeah.. yeah, yo, yo

[Killah Priest]
The mouth and tongue of Malcolm
Tellin' my publicist, fuck this government
Go 'head and make my album, this is the judgment
Vacate the island, billions will start wildin'
The feelin' of violence will have trillions in silence
Or watchin' the news, Arabs against Jews
They bombin' the schools, political fools
Liberal move, is all confused, gun users
Instead of peace talk, fuck this world
I ride for Z. York, pass the heat off
I blast at Farahkhan to overthrow Babylon
Fuck this world, that's why we carry on
By the Email Fidel, tell him meet me on the D.L.
No longer a free world, think of shank or Verra'
This be the days of terror.. SoulStice

[SoulStice]
Oh shit, amazin' grace, how sweet the sound
Savin' slaves, another body found
Bound to the streets where we drown if we sleep
We make heat instead of peace
Struggle to heat, and breathe
On Shiek metal swords before we eat
To teach, shake my head in disbelief
41 shots, a young brotha deceased
Gunned down by police, is there no justice, no peace?
So fuck the police, listen, I walk with P.
Ignorance leakes like back streets of sickness
Or disease, and our weakness, we bleed
Deceive to believe in this modern Eden, we thieve
Conceive through this belly, we beasts
Ninety thieves stalk woods for Priest
Leave out this laws of Camenites
We strive to rise like height
But through hate we over-weigh our fate
And fall like meteorite, to spread the self-sacrifice
Instill like these parasites, in drug bites
Prescribe a mind of 360 degree fahrenheit
In the dark like midnight, these words I recite
I once was blind but now I..

[Killah Priest]
See the light..
Freedom fights in prison, sprung from religion
Taught by elders, the system failed us, no one to help us
Priest is, withstanding Priestess, but stand on thrones judgin' Egypt
Peep the eclipse, the shadows cover the moon
The Devils govern the fools, they stubborn as Jews
Pearls before swine, I quiz them, they need more time
Seek the wisdom, free your mind
From the cobras, it's Priest and SoulStice
We came to teach the culture
We can stand the heat like vultures
Open ya wings, the soul of a King
Song of a Queen, dawned with the wings
Bow and kiss 'em, if he's a fraud than strip 'I'm
From all this badness, greet him with daggers
We more than rappers, we the masters

[SoulStice]
Even after.. World War 3, the war of intelligence
The court, self-defence is common sense
Third corridors and drug stores
Immensely spokes and leave scars of no evidence
Dense minds outlined in chalk, the refined walk
Can rise again like cocks, a resurrection at box
Religious, intervenous, take my name in vain
Clinically insane, hold secrets
Mentally slain for their repentance by the government
Hold the third commandment, who's the man sent?
Modern Lazurus, hands wake the nation

[Killah Priest]
It's revelations, I'm takin' medication, my head is achin'
I've been by a weapon since the 11th
Stars and stripes vs. a star and crescent
God's blessin', be a soldier, I gotta speak out on Oprah
I'm Under Siege, I grab my gun and fatigues
Plead my woman and seeds, hundreds shall bleed
I speak blunted from weed
Do why'all really want peace or why'all want to see war?
Crates of candles on crates of C4
Why they rich and why we poor?
If he Jacob do that make him Esaw?
Is Colin Powell really Bush as Igor?
Why did terrorist attack the entire Eastern seaboard?
Who taught the men to kill theyselves?
They're received Allah's rewards, we need to read more
Priest, I rap with razor blades on the side of each jaw
In the millennium, war against Palestinians
A century is done, plenty of guns
Plenty of bombs, many shall come
And my name, a homeless man ridin' a train
Day and night, leavin' my head with migraines
It's the atomic age, we either smokin' chronic or sage
The blood of Jesus, Decepti-concept
Martin Luther King had a dream
Gun shots create a smokescreen
We throw on concrete, I wear a bandana like the Panthers
Back to court with my handgun

[Chorus x2: Both]
It's real as the masonic seal on a dollar bill
Conspiracy theories that got Kennedy killed
Or the secret governments, Blood and Crip
Worldwide, look at the future through your third eye
GoodBye..",Goodbye

Nah, I can't take this this time
Everybody got the boy stressed, about to do somethin', you know
Trynna hold me back too long, try to get this money any way I could

Look, my cash nope, baby cryin'
Had enough, I grabbed my iron
Call up the crew, is what you do
Be in my spot, around two
Oh yeah, bring some guns, bring some mac's
I got a way, we can make some cash
My woman beefin', my momma sick
If I don't get it, look, I'mma flip
The doorbell ring, exchange some slang
We laughed a little, ya'll got them things
Okay thanks, now look here's the plan
Hold up, please, whose your man?
Oh him? That's, my man Sharod
Don't worry about him, that's the God
He specializes in gun firin'
Pickin' locks, ditchin' cops
And robberies, goes on, robbin' sprees
He's the, he's the man, here's the plan
Remember the bank, we at before
Well, he headed back to make a withdrawel

We about to catch a body (damn right, I'mma get it)
We about to catch a body (damn right, I'mma get it)

Three in the back, two in the front
Loaded up the gats, while we pullin' up
Here's the spot, let's make it pop
Anything move, we make it hot
Doors open, we put our masks on
Our gats poked, it won't take that long
Anybody grab me, I whispered softly
Do what you got to do, to get them off me
Hands twitchin', gettin' feelings
Saw the security, might have to kill 'em
Walk through the door, damn it's crowded
Walked on the floor, then shouted
(It's a robbery!) Everybody down
Don't make a move, don't wanna hear a sound
Looked a Sharod, gave me the nod
Let me know, I did my job

[Chorus 2X]

[Killah Priest]
Told the teller, feel the bags
Had the mack, pointin' at the glass
Hurry up, you're movin' slow
Time is money and I got to go
Grab the bags, head for the door
Backin' out, clutchin' the dog
We heard sirens, dashed to the ride
And cop we see, open fire
Cop car, swung around the block
My man Rock, opened up the shots
My homey Lace, real nutty case
Said let's get it on, fuck a chase
Women screamin', grabbin' they kids
My homey Lace, flashin' the shit
Laughin' and shit, homey is sick
Look at Sharod, said let's go
Four desperado's, holdin' the dough
Make a left, yo, make a right
Head straight, though, watch those lights
We're in the hideout, laughin' it up
Watchin' the news, about the bank we stuck

Stay Russian my direction I'm wettin' like a leaf bone

That's what niggaz face when fuckin' with the Sunz of Man 
Go to the dungeon I could lead a hundred men, with a golden pen 
Forced to intercept with the click from Shaolin

I be the Star from afar illuminating through the dark 
Another burning face of death

Reminiscing about the days, raising hell 
Representative of a mind, able to lead a city what technicality of mankind

Shot up the charts the soldiers from the dark

Militant, armed to killin and shake the settlement
Searchin crevaces for a wise man's testament
Roll hotly bludgeonin all those competitin
Against I but stimulate ya of life and matter
Cloak and dagger, first I gag ya then stab ya

No retreat and no surrender

Government officials, evil minds that govern this land gotta plan
For the blacks and the tans
Decrease the population of the rhythm nation
By one fourth, wicked niggas is the source
To the force I bring forth causes havocs, sparks bloody riots
Seven days and seven nights of blue street fights
Like boo took all the shells from automatics
Strategic tactics
Caught between rhymes, lines combine to blow up like landmines

[Beretta 9]
I strike on universal fish, I'm out the clear mist
Relentless, beat a nigga senseless
Niggas best to witness
At how I gets to business, soldier from the trenches

Surrender your garments and your legal tender
Fatigued ninja with silent triggers

Be shatterin knees while bladders bleed

Within my breath that I drop to make your heart stop
You can't cope with this vocal dope that'll corrode your throat
Yet alone make a local choke
I strip niggas of they manhood because I'm no damn good
And roll with a Killa Wu Clan in the hoods

The star trilogy  scars and injuries inflicted on my enemies 
Attack you mentally  draw up and stand just like a centipede 
Then strike fast  leave ya weak ass up in a sling 
In the infirmary  telling war stories like you was king up 
In my rainforest, yet the God rain the hardest 
Flame and fury, torch off ya skin tissue and cartilage 
Throw darts the sharpest, aimed at ya head, ya man parted 
Looking retarded, telling him you never should've started 
What you couldn't end, handled my friend since age ten 
But he's not my brother, though he helped me out up in da deep cover 
When shit got hot, all palms sweating on the rubber

Bastard Swordsman, swing yo shit 
(I'm duckin' all of 'em 
Swingin back, double edged axe we cuttin' all of 'em) 

Inflicted with a rare disease, MC's flee 
Fought wars for centuries my wounds bled killer bees 
Roam the battle site word, shatter mics I've had a tragic life 
Blood splatter nice ghetto life live on a satellite 
Blind, injected with venom from water moccasins 
The child who floated in the air lock without oxygen 
For seventeen years all I learned was profanity 
Graduated from the academy of insanity 
Holocaust, loud mouth who roams wise 
I'm hideous glancing gouge out ya own eyes 
West Coast that grotesque group flow's wet 
Bury you and some in Norweiga wit a broke neck 
Wu-Tang, seven death blows 
Explore the globe, 
Stand in shallow water and slaughter those who oppose 
The passionate destroyer who stings like antiseptic 
Barbaric, esoteric, half-sorcerer, half-skeptic 
Anorexic, war machine, 
Depressed, drunken mess 
Learn from the best, snatchin' ya fossil from ya flesh 
Bloodshot, Doctor Killgrave, subterranean 
Skeleton's reinforced with stone and titanium 
Gyros, hun blood and oil flow as one 
Mental powers override iron fist and blade tongue 
The Bronx Don, with bomb songs, hit Hong Kong 
Holocaust is scientific experiment gone wrong 

Yo, Ally Commanders come dress to kill 
At the Armageddon Wedding 
We're the old temple platoon ya die soon 
Our battlegrounds in the womb of the moon 
Most of y'all niggas is cloons 
Gettin' hit by typhoons, machine guillotines 
Rip out the spleens, tonight while ya screams 
I'll blast ya in ya dreams, listen to my bombs 
Like you used to read the Psalms 
I got firearm like Megatron, asthma attack rap 
Snaps, windpipes crack, 
Bury ya ass beneath the graveyard shack 
Third eyes like binoculars, visions of the lyrical opera 
Sponsor the conquer, I blow spots like the Unabomber 
The stage is made of steel cage, battlegrounds of 
Starrcade '98, I meditate at a rate that'll cause an earthquake 
I drop antrax bombs on your plantation, 
Then murder you twice, to make sure there's no reincarnation 

[Chorus: x2] 

My mind is bad, because it's great to see that full 
My old dad, and charter his story 
And made him believe in a my-story 
That's how you know times is bad 
When Gods is being killed by crabs 
That invest these streets, it ain't safe no more 
So before you leave your front door the war is cold 
So grab your heats, your God-you now 
And your Teflon cause the war's on like 
Red Dawn, I'm a threat to America like Saddam 
I be the verbal terrorist doing the strength of his language 
Now I'm mad like Max, when I attack tracks 
To the death of Wu wax, I drop facts like 
Bombs on Saigon, it be the music that makes me sick 
And act like a paranoid schizophrenic, 
I leave your mind in a state of panic, 
Like a claustrophobic trapped on the Titanic

Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
Have you ever asked a grown man why?
Why do ya feel that way inside?
Sometimes I had to swallow my pride and settle for less
Lord don't settle for less, you more like the best
To me, as I pull my head out my skully,
and I give praise due to those who mean somethin to me
Moms, you incredible, you raised me all by yourself
Regardless of the situation, there was food in the shelf
Pops, you abandoned me, you left me all alone
In this cold warzone, I had to fence for my own
My sister Candie, probably the only one that understands me
Girl I love you to death, you never turned your back on me
La-Familia sick, I wish I had the hands to heal you quick
And rid you of a disease you livin with
A young father, I've been blessed with two little girls
You two jewels more precious than diamonds or pearls
A part of me from a different perspective
And any woman that I'm dealin with is gonna have to respect it
On the outside there's negativity
Please killa cause on the inside
Me and my team'll make you feel it

Own the company witcha man, incorporate
She told me I was handsome -- I know I look funny with big lips
But that's the love she had for her son, the 9th Prince
Forever you exist in my circumference
You left my brain numbness, at night sometimes I cry
Wipe the salty tears from my eyes,
and feel lies, life's no job
You caught up in the Beehive,
but mom, ever since you been gone ain't nothin changed
Rza got a new Range, I can't complain
Them fake cats, stay in they lane
Your grandaughter Angelica, is gettin bigger
More figures I gotta spend on Princess Corinthia
Pull LaVoyd pictures, back when fam was ghetto prisoners
Let's all hold hands, and sing for the listeners

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

Alive, alive, when you face death, you feel alive
Kill it, kill it, channel your animal side
Fire, fire, it's time to start a riot

Unleash your wings
Unleash your soul
Unleash yourself
From the sun

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand
A burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling, like Icarus to land
Too late to kill the flame that I fanned

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand

Killer Hayseeds,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

65 Cevrolet Ipala peachy cream
Cruisin' down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talkin' 'bout meetin' at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em' a good game, juju pimpin'
Give em' to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

I've got my mind all over you
(All day I dream about...)

You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I dont need that A-I-D-S
A D and an A missin' out my ADIDAS
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumpin' brooms

Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, BOOM

The way you move your sexy groove

Welcome to the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Anything goes strippers and live shows
It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Ecstasy, hydro, and good blow
It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Hoes strip, where pimps and hoes do strolls
It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Where hustlas collect rocks and straight rolls

Welcome home motherfuckers your back again
Into the den of inequity the life of sin
Where after the after party and the hotel lobbies
Probably find me drunk off Bacardi in a swank hotel
An aspiring actress
Trying to push her back through a thousand dollar mattress
In Chicago a couple of bottles, couple of models, stolen Diablos
Fast and furious going full throttle
Post club function, pills get swallowed
Ladies get loose and so do bra staps
Power, money, and sex drive good raps
Freaks emerge in a twilight with party pack
Of hydros alcohol blurred eye sight
From dusk til dawn is when vampires roam
Pro athletes trick and don't go home

Riding with my nigga Big Boi you don't sleep
Even partied with Diddy up in NYC
Got drunk, rubbed titties of Dominican freaks
Every night bachelor party in the boom boom room
On trees get burned or liquor consumed
You ain't really seen a color till you seen it on shrooms
Lipstick on the pale of my Pelle Pele
Spot hotter than fish scales cooked in coked ale
Vampire party and we gets it down
In the undergrounds underground
Underground in club commer's basement
Ladies and low lifes do get wasted
So high you can't hear the music but you feel it when the bass hits
The atmosphere like the first year
Freak bass hit everybodys heart goes fast
Rolling Mitsubishi's shakin' that ass

And which nigga want to fight (what!)
I'm the club with Suge Knight, Ike, and Killer Mike (how does it feel)
Fat dick for all my enemies
Caught a disease fucking Roy and Jazzie T (a ha ha)
My girlfriends a fucking fool
When she turned her back
I'm making out with her mother like I'm in high school (shhh)
And I don't sale crack to my African brothers
I sell it to they mothers and they ex-lovers (that's true)
So go ahead bitch pop the X
So I can work your neck in the back of my Vett (ahh!)

Mental flame from the barrel claim 25 angel, mercy
Long as the black board, splatter with his inside
Never had a chance to ride his new skateboard
Billy didn't shake lord, he fell silent
Died in the pantomime of cold violence
His killer didn't even blink, he couldn't think
Even when he heard the sirens kept firing
Pupils dilated, possessed and perspiring
He grew up admiring, 30 auts and calicos
are-15 and long barreled 44's so on the story goes
He went out in a blaze of glory
He went out in a front page story

These monsters of then are who I bang with
Who I bang with, Crips, Bloods, BG, VL we have created our own road to hell
We train to kill and not to feel, reacting with a mac
But no matter who I kill I can't bring my nigga back
My niggaz dead and I can't get my fucking head around it
We was just smoking blunts of the best chronic
And now I'm wearing a t-shirt with his picture on it
Staggering about to vomit, consumed with vengeance
With my vengeance I'm all consumed, by mid afternoon smoking blunts in my room
To whom ever this letter may concern
When bullets strike they burn more than the flesh of the ones hit
You took my nigga my heart split, its broken, shattered in a million pieces
Help me Jesus, help me Jesus, just help me Jesus, thug niggaz killers
They victims was screaming help me Jesus

Get my findy(?) Air Force Ones

Last one to Louie Fitoine skins on my timbo's
Gettin' blown in a limo, that's my M.O.
Roll next presidential, get a pistol to your temple
I'll let it faint, leave your brain lingering in limbo
Southern fried that's how I ride, creed on simple
Kill 'em all let God separate good from evil
You faggots do it for glory
y'alls just do it for my people
I'm grand national built beautiful and legal

[Verse 3: Slimm Calhoun]
A town down Braves started cap from the land of the made
ain't no hard atrap after depts of the dungeon
We livin' artifacts where niggaz rip chickens
talk bricks, keep an artist strapped
Flame throwers got us hot in the spot
wreckin these dog tails through red dog stripe
It's like all hell, block cells
make bail and it's back to these crooks and cakes jumpin' at next cell
What you know about the way the whales
kiss it your body scaled
I'm 'bout to hit by the box of tens through the mail
then reply beaten twelve sickness spinnin' on twenty-ones
We produce many guns, we spittin' at anyones
Disrespect (?) little bows
and I'll cock and explode up
Take me to the grave, grave, home of the brave
[Chorus]
[Killer Mike]
So slums, so sligh, nigga (i'm) straight ducked
you can ask my baby's mother she'll tell you niggaz shit
He the type to fuck a bitch
rob that bitch's baby brother
[Slimm Calhoun]
And I'm the type to rip ya bitch leave the shit up under your covers

New recrutes we in it again
rap so hard we flippin' again
walkin' dubs on the benz

One, two, crack fiend

Four full blown hit the scene

Like a thick hoe in sassy jeans
rub her right she'll cream
Fuck her right moan and scream

Swervin', servin', bouncin' the buttons

round my hip strap ain't jumpin'
Keep my bitch dunkin' somethin'

[Chorus] - repeat to fade",Home of the Brave
Killer Mike,"Peace will never tame the hatrid of me
I'm too restricted, separated from your society..
I'm a new breed of species, a curse to lift that speak my name
I'm different twisted, my mind is not the same

For those who deny the truth, will seek to try and find it
You my friend are blinds of the truth for you are simple minded

My ways are called abnormal, they treath me as if forsaken
But all should feel the wrath just like when my heart was taken

And if these words fail to reach their ears and for limit their view
You won't know but when I stryke you'll wish that you've of knew...

This beast is on the loose, if you treasure life then destroy it
For it is too realistic for you to simply ignore it

I've given a fair warning now I've been well because I've cut it loose
A new terror walks the earth and now it's all up to you

If all hope shall fail then you should sit and ponder

Fuck rap, rap's near death, bloated and sick
Too many niggaz still ride, Big and Pac's dick
Fuck that, next year, they more deader
And I write more rhymes, more deadly and more better
Then the last, sick and disturbed verse I wrote
And sell it to tough teenage boys to quote
Some music to madness, let the anger kill the pain and the sadness
Fuck the fag shit, keep it Killer with the rap shit
Hard rock when you rock shit, back to the block freestyle pop lock shit
Back to the basics with the fuck a cop shit
Rock pussies rap on some pop shit, sing like they rap
Soft and frail, these spirits, didn't have the heart to smell

""Fuck you Killer Mike!"" Yeah fuck you too
No this ain't yo mama's music
It's a drug if you like it, please abuse it

There's a mosh pit packed with wild teens
Hangin' onto every word that we spit

I might pop one of those, it don't matter my nigga - I don't miss
They put me hot on list, where players are posted
But them players we posted up on corners, when they say and get roasted

And the prayer get toasted, 'cause I keep the flame on

Killer Mike," 

(Killer Mike talking on the phone)
Aight... so you niggaz want to know how a nigga is up in jail...
Servin' a 40 to life sentence...
For dope that wasn't even his
Just sit back and listen, I'll tell you
It's a hilarious day boooyyy, and it's a wild, wild chain of events
that get yo ass in hea...

[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't want to sell, birds no more
(I got a fuckin' funny story to tell you)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(You rem'ber me and big Paul and my whole crew nigga?)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(Government snitches are amazin...)
Mama, I don't want to sell, crack no more
(Just listen, only take about 3 minutes, just listen)

[Verse 1]
After high school, I gained lots of weight
And I ain't talkin' bout calories put on by steak
The recipe I'm cookin' may send me upstate
Use bakin' soda, cook the pie, collect cake
Now Pillsbury, these niggaz kick down doors
Find out what mills bury
Shit's very intense and criti-cal
And when we drew pistols shit got piti-ful
The first lick was bullshit, a half a brick
We robbed the middle man and a bum bitch, the dumb bitch
But between me and him and that hoe
We walked away with 18 and a bigger score
Some nigga named Salvatore from El Salvador
Got silver teeth and a scar on his jaw
Young Antonio Montana, held up mansion north Atlanta
We hit'em hard as doors hammer, yea!

[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't want to sell, birds no more
(Okay, I know whachu thinkin', it's on righ, we on righ, we on)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(Hold up, hold up, hold up, be patient, be patient, listen to the rest
listen, listen)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(Man I feel like a asshole just tellin' you this man)
Mama, I don't want to sell, crack no more

(Tell the kid to give me the card, check it out
here's where it gets interestin, follow this shit)

[Verse 3]
??? the spot had more birds than a pet shop
More gunz than a Vietnam vet, we was set
Loaded up the work and let's jet
My nigga big Paul loaded up the you-Haul
A thousand pounds uncut raw
Hold on, whus that I saw in the distance?
Did he have a crew offerin assistance?
Paul said it's prolly nuthin', a small animal or somethin'
My nerves got to jumpin', I swear I heard somethin'
I pointed the 4-5th in the wind and started thumpin'
The blue lights is comin', my crew is runnin'
Cops is everywhere, they keep comin'
All of us sick, and all of us caught, holdin our dick
We robbed the niggaz, same day the fuckin FEDs hit
We robbed the niggaz, same day the fuckin FEDs hit
Me and Salvatore fucked up in the mix
That middle man and dumb bitch
Them niggaz snitched, GOD DAMN!

[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't want to sell, birds no more
(So young man, that's why the fuck I'm sittin here wearin these pants ???)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(I hear Salvatore got ??? or some shit)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(The bum bitch that snitched, tss... who knows?)
Mama I don't want to sell, crack no more

(Man I shoulda fuckin stayed in job corp
stayed my fuckin ass in job corp, doin dumbass shit

With no hesitation were in this killer kali nation

It relaxes my brain so you know I can't complain I know you like this its makeing you go insane NORTE is what I bang
So get it threw your brain

La la la, la la la, yeah..

[Chorus x2]
I would never leave you girl (My girl, my wife)
You know I love you (My pain, my strife)
Oh baby, oh baby
I would never leave you girl (Good days, bad nights)
You know I love you (Lovely fistfights)
Oh baby, oh baby

Killa for, look at us, forvever fucked up
All we do is fuck, fight, and get X'ed up
Enough, enough
We bad for each other, mama
But our sex life ain't right without drama
In combat, sweet agony upon that
I deliver, make you take it soft and break it hard
Like dope dealers, I'm a husband to a wife
But I'm ya nigga, and you a perfect drug
Make a nigga heart quiver
You a hard breakin hard liquor on my liver
Like 'dro and gin go together, you a mind shifter
Body dark like a Cognac, I'm pissy drunk
In light ??, I stay drunk
My pretty little vampire, my delila
Teach me how to hate the truth and how to love a liar
You a vicious mind-bending ??
You the perfect drug, ultimate high, and I'm a fiend

[Chorus]

You're my path to the pen or the crazy house
I deliver dick raw and won't take it out
Either that or you the devil's daughter, can't fake it
Killing me slow, I know and I can't shake it
Please stay, please leave, please don't go
Please walk away and let me be to die slow
This love is deeper than the grave and it's forever
Snake pit, you're venom beyond measure
Pandora's box a lot, my treasure
If love is strong as the grave, make me deader
Jezebel got my soul and my cheddar
Every time I beat it down, it jumps wetter
Like a dark cloud, bringing me pain and bad weather
I remain inside of your rain with no umbrella
I couldn't write the words, I blame this letter
Til death do us part, we deserve to be together

[Chorus]

A living drug, you're the bitch I hate to love
Learned to suck good dick by fuckin' thugs
A nigga can't teach you, spread like a track meet
Breaking D-boys, MCs, and athletes, but not me
Told you from the start this shit is forever
We gon' go through this bad weather together
Whether the road or high side, you gon' ride
Through the fistfights and black eyes, it's you and I
Ike and Tina, our love is measured on a milimeter
They say a partner don't love a nigga til a nigga eat her
But I'm raw, and tired of the motherfuckin talking
I'll be goddamned if you hit the door walking
I'm stalkin, the depths of Atlantis, evil enchantress
Slick and underhanded
Fuckin with you like dancing with the devil, no command bitch
No ?? leaving niggaz empty-handed
I lost everything I had just to lust you
Bitch, you take another step and I'll bust you
Bitch you take another step and I'll bust you

Killer Mike,"I'm going on tour, and I'm gonna show anybody
Out there that thinks for one second that maybe
I'm second guessing myself
That I am the greatest of all time forever and ever
One surprise, one surprise, shh! Wooo! I'm back

To make it out the ice cold streets of the city
You better have a Christopher word game, witty
You better have a dance game similar to Diddy
Or play b-ball above the rim like Smitty
Josh, Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol
Or any other nigga that ball and tall
I used to sell it white as Paul Wall
Gave my young boi three of them in the mall
And he gon' bring me 75K back tomorrow
You know what Bigga 'bout, you know what Bigga do
Ice water in my veins, heart pumpin' igloo
I'm familiar wit the money so who the fuck is you?
What the fuck you do? Where the fuck you from? Who you knowing?
Somebody get this nigga, I don't know him
And I'm 'bout to jet off on his ass like a Boeing
Going, going, going, gone, song

You don't like the prestige that I have in life.
You don't like the notoriety.
You detest the fact that I got more cars than most of you have friends!
I got a big house on the big side of town
I got life pretty much the way I want it!

To make it out the ice cold streets of the city
Your mindstate gotta be as wicked as Fiddy
Can't love life suckling on mama's titty
'Cause life is a bitch and a bitch ain't with it
You gotta have faith livin' life on Biggie
I'm ready to die for the money, who is with me?
Life after death, hey this must be hell
I asked for six figures, God gave back self
I'm on my way to heaven in a Porsche 911
Buried in my car, I'm surrounded by a harem
Surrounded by my brethren, my funeral is legend
Buried like a Pharaoh with my jewelry in the desert
The government will hate me like Jesus, but fuck 'em
I did it for the grind, I did it for the hustle
I did it for the people on the bottom in the struggle
I did it for my comrades, did it 'cause I love 'em

Custom made brother, woo! And I mean custom made!
From the alligators to the Oleg Cassini right here
Ric Flair! there's only one.
And I don't care if it's Tokyo, Japan, Greensboro
Richmond, Charlotte, North Carolina, Asheville,
Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte
L.A, I'm the man that's makin' it possible!

To make it out the ice cold streets of the city
You gotta politic your situations like Clinton
If you chase power you ain't gotta chase women
So take some advice, take cash over ass
When you get money you ain't gotta take shit
So, long as you broke she ain't gotta take dick
Capiche?
Now you know what motivate your bitch
Capiche?
Pay the mortgage or the pussy up for lease
Capiche?
Church ladies goin' gaga for the Gucci (yah!)
Got two Nickis ménagin' for some Louie (yah!)
Work with the keys, get acquainted with Alicia
And every other girl named Rihanna wanna meet ya
They in it for the money, not the swag or the features
Pretty parasites might suck you like leeches
Just some information for a student from a teacher
Real life shit, I'm Mike Bigga, nice to meet ya, gone

At Delta, the girls call me cool.
At Eastern the girls call me Slick Ric
And all the other women around the world just say
Oh, there goes the man, woo!",Ric Flair
Killer Mike,"Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman moving through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move
Through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as I'm passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him
Forty one times, he committed no crime
But I guess life ain't Times Square
But in the city that's gritty where the bottom is shitty
Where the mayor's a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it
And Brooklyn, keep on taking it
Cause life just ain't that fair
For the kids in the park, watching out for the Narcs
Putting Sour Diesel in the air
Trying to flip them a pass, that they got a couple back
And make them get the hell out of here!

Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many clouds in the sky
I can hear them calling out to me
I can hear them calling out

Let the city peel away right from under you
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me!

Let the city peel away 
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me!

I maneuver through the ATL in a black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though it's black cops from the mayors to the top
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house, no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward, these young black boys
Seem to self-sabatoge they selves
Or maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston, well it kills itself (Atlanta)

Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many clouds in the sky
I can hear them calling out to me
I can hear them calling out
Let the city peel away right from under you

I can hear them calling out to me
I can hear them calling out

Killer Mike,"I woke up this morning to a cop with a gun
Who told me that he looking for a nigga on the run
I thought for a second and I screwed my face
And asked the dirty pig “Why the fuck you in my place?”
He said “Chill or we kill, this is a warning”
Then I told him “fuck you, Where is the warrant?”
Then they got to punchin’ and kickin’ and macin’
Then the whole situation went Larry Davis
Thinking ’bout my lady and thinking ’bout my baby
Thinking “these two motherfucking pigs going crazy”
They wanna kill a nigga ’cause a nigga on this rap shit
Wanna leave me dead on a mattress, Hampton
I’m a Public Enemy because I’m cold lampin’
And I don’t give a fuck about a party in The Hamptons
And I don’t give a fuck about a motherfuckin’ Forbes List
Far as I’m concerned, that’s a motherfucking whores list

Motherfucker, my dad was a cop
You don’t think I know a dirty ass cop when I see one?
Shake down, take down, disrespecting-the-badge-ass-bitch!

Back to the scene going wild in the bedroom
Grab the cop’s gun left from leaking with a head wound
Second cop shot, but the bullet hit his partner
Shot him in the leg and he hit him in the arter(y)
Now the dirty cop’s looking at me
Talking ’bout he kill a nigga if I try to flee
Shit, I’m about to loose it, so he gon’ have to prove it
All because the government hate rap music
I’ve been labeled outlaw, renegade, villain
So is Martin King, so the system had to kill him
A nigga with an attitude, the world gotta feel him
Educated villain, attempt on living
If I gotta kill a cop just to get out the building
That mutherfucker didn’t, left dead, no feelings
Yelling “Fuck him” as I buck A 45 at his fillings
Trying to knock his brains through the motherfucking ceiling

When I surface on the streets I can hear the crowd yelling
And see the neighborhood snitches pointing and telling
I’m bailing like a felon or Assata Shakur
Before the law leave me stinking like a bag of manure
Like Jeriko One in the movie ‘Strange Days’
They want a nigga dead ’cause the things that I say
Might make the youth go and pick up an AK
Tell the government “Fuck you, no way”
Like John Connor mama I be running everyday
‘Cause if I get caught it’s my life they terminate
Or stick me in a cell on Guantanamo Bay
All because a nigga won't sit in and obey
I’ll be an outlaw before I ever behave
And die a free man before I live like a slave
Nothing changes, if they catch me today
“Fuck the police” is still all I gotta say",Don't Die
Killer Mike,"And I'm sitting on the edge of my bed holding my head
Trying to make this cake like a baker
And get some bread
My mama said hustlin' does come with feds
Time do the crime you better had be prepared
For what comes with it the killing the court convictions
Snorting, bitches, the snitches often they get acquitted
While the real sent to prison, to rot away while they living
And all because I say dope shit they on a mission
To nail my black ass to the wall with a conviction
I pray the Lawd hear me but really Lawd is ya listen'n
Praying when I'm in trouble I'm speaking with forked tongue
I say I'm out the game but I'm flinching like George Jung
I must be in the clutches of Satan it's all warm
My mama took you to the ""root lady"" to read my palm
She puts beads on my neck saying they protecting me from harm
But fuck this old witch, I went and got a gun

Oh Lord, Jesus, glory
Oh Lord
Oh Lord, Jesus, glory
Oh Lord

Looking at the bezel of my Breitling
Thinking that I used to sell raps for enlightenment
But I got lapped by them guys selling lies for the white man
Now I sell pies for the white man
And my tour bus is a moving indictment
This must be how Huey felt when the revolution failed
And in Oakland nigga turned him on to a sack of yayo
You know this feeling false but it feels like yeah
I may have lost my cause but not a reason to rebel
Revolutionary or drug dealer I'm in jail

And pillars tall in my sight
Then I heard voices sing
Sweet in the air [they fell through]
Haunting you
And then the song became alive - song and dance
Ways we've lost come flooding back now
Then my ancestors awake
(then I forgot myself)
And in our joy they take their joy
And in their skills we take our skills
Then all the lines between are gone
Then all the lines between are gone
Stick hit the skin - I hit the stick
And we've all been keeping time
So all you boys keep playing the drums

On my way to Tiahuanaco
Where the balance of a weeping god
Faced east to the rising sun

But I looked out the window
And all I could see
Was the face of a girl
She was looking at me

She was begging for food
Then I knew I had found
The weeping god
In the face of a child

As she gestures with her fingers
Her little brother followed suit
And all I did was take my camera
So the image never fades away

I no longer saw the great gate of the sun
Nor the dawn of time when our race had begun
Just black eyes like starving dogs looking at me
A weeping god was all I'd ever see

And as I sat in contemplation beyond all charity
Losing the magic and meaning of living
(the earth and the stars these things are mine)
And when they've drained the earth of all resources
We'll face the music still
For you and I shall be striking memories
In the thoughts of our children's children

I had arrived at my destination
At the gate of the rising sun
We shall again regain in sunset that balance
That we left undone

I stared at the shacks and the shanty town mess
I couldn't help but to think of the West
The balance was lost and my reason went wild
As the weeping god came alive in the child

I began to weep
And I remember the violation

Killing Joke,"Solitude,solitude
We come into this world alone
And to this place we return again
Far away in a quiet place

Try to think of an open space
I watch my life flash before me
Remembered friends that I love so dearly
And while a veil obscures my vision
I surrender to the will of God

I found peace ,yes I found at last
All I see has been meant to be?
Down, down in the forest clearing
With a breeze blowing through the branches

And I breathe in and out so very slowly
It sends a shiver right down my spine
In the quiet I can come to terms with
All I've done and who I am

I turn and face the sun
Then all my troubles fall behind me like a shadow
In solitude
Solitude",Solitude
Killing Joke,"Understanding the meaning of struggle
Giving your whole life to a single passion
Which others may or may not
Consider obsolete

Like a rare flower
Seen by a few before it withers and dies
(before it withers and dies)
Seeing it all
All the way through the very end
Regardless

A full stop followed by an exclamation mark
Written in your flesh and blood
Getting knocked down every time
Getting knocked down every moment
You get up, until you love getting up

I know what you've been going through
I've been there too
God knows I've been pushing hard 
Pushing so damn hard 
I've forgotten what the hell I'm even 
Pushing for

Recognize it when it happens to you
Learn to recognize it and know what to do
Stop clinging on, let go, own nothing
Do it out of love
Do it out of love

Words cannot substitute
Losing everything
Losing your home
Losing your money
Your dignity
Losing your mind, your beliefs, ideals
Then and only then
When everything is gone
You no longer care
Your soul standing naked and bare
Stripped down to the truth
Then you'll find everything
On heaven and earth
On heaven and earth
On heaven and earth

The struggle is long
The struggle is hard
The struggle is beautiful",Struggle
Killing Joke,"Ten percent of the rest
Is the hand that pulls the strings
Be the privileged few (to have to own to hold)
Power over the people yes yes

Green gestures of a dying planet
An endless debate only too late
An appetite for gluttony

So you stamp and cheat on people

Indulging, with what you call good living

But most of all there is too much fat on your heart - pig

For the cash you've already spent

Privatize the people's lives
Be part of the company (or fade!)
Appliance of science to privatize their lives

Water is our business
Electricity is our business
Gas is our business
Lives are our business
Business is our business

Your money, my time
Your stinking industrial bathwater, my wine
Imbalance induces hate
How will you bridge the gap
Between the endless buffet
And the empty plate I have

I feel hate I feel hate
I feel hate I feel hate
(Don't be afraid to show your hate, hate!)

Killing Joke,"Take a walk to the new town, take a look around

Awaiting things to come again, nice things to come

Killing Joke,"The lore of elders passes judgment on this waste
And finding me or them does lack accepting fate
And as the moments pass another face arrives
We watch them come and go with speed of passing clouds

Forbidden fruits of dreams that rule our thoughts my love
Of lands untouched and ways to come always maybe
But choking on promises meant for the deal
Thinking again the darkest hour before the dawn

Confirming fears that from the dawn of time have been
Retracing footsteps in dark chambers of grey lands
And through the madness through the terror we must pass
As if awaiting sunlight that may never come

In time we face ourselves with all our faults and fears
Now that I know the final conflict is within
I recognize the faces of my friends and hear the call
""Come journey, journey with me through the darkest hour""",Darkness Before Dawn
Killing Joke,"Back to square one, and the old school backfire
It's just begun, let's watch the blind eyes turning
Stains on the wall, been waiting far too long now
Nice day, blue sky, I watch them shrug their shoulders
Tighten the grip (getting tighter)
Now see the ball is rolling
We take delight, it's been a long wait for this moment.

Back to square one, another empire backfire
Back to square one, another empire backfire

SIgn of the time, blood pressure running high now
Nowhere to dance, which channel can you turn to?
We take delight, we watch them shrug their shoulders
Let's take delight, it's been a long wait for this moment.

Back to square one (now it's my turn)
Another Empire backfire

Snuggle, snuggle safe in bed 

Take the weight right off my shoulder

Bright eyed young inherit all

They was drawn towards the Hum 
Plenty more where they come from.
