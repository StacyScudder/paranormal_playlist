Pretenders,"Show me the meaning of the word
Show me the meaning of the word
'Cause I've heard so much about it
They say, ""Hey, you can't live without it""

Welcome to the human race
With its wars, disease and brutality
You with your innocence and grace
Restore some pride and dignity
To a world in decline

Welcome to a special place
In a heart of stone that's cold and gray
You with your angel face
Keep the despair at bay
Send it away, and

Show me the meaning of the word
Show me the meaning of the word
'Cause I've heard so much about it
I don't want to live without it
I don't want to live without it
Oh, I want love
I want love
I want love

Welcome here from outer space
The Milky Way is still in your eyes
You found yourself a hopeless case
One that's seeking perfection on earth
That's some kind of rebirth, so

Show me the meaning of the word
Show me the meaning of the word
'Cause I've heard so much about it
Don't make me live without it
Oh, love
I want love
I want
Love
I want love",Show Me
Pretenders,"Such a drag to want something sometime
One thing leads to another I know
Was a time wanted you for mine
Nobody knew
You arrived like a day
And passed like a cloud
I made a wish, I said it out loud
Out loud in a crowd
Everybody heard
It was the talk of the town

It's not my place to know what you feel
I'd like to know but why should I?
Who were you then, who are you now?
Common laborer by night, by day highbrow
Back in my room I wonder, then I
Sit on the bed, look at the sky
Up in the sky
Clouds rearrange
Like the talk of the town

Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday
Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday
You've changed your place in this world
You've changed your place in this world

Oh but it's hard to live by the rules
I never could and still never do
The rules and such never bothered you
You call the shots and they follow
I watch you still from a distance then go
Back to my room, you never know
I want you, I want you but now
Who's the talk of the town?

Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday
Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday
You've changed your place in this world
You've changed your place in this world",Talk of the Town
Pretenders,"It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

It's five o'clock in the morning
And you're just getting in
You knock on the door
And a voice sweet and low says who is it
She opens up the door and lets you in
Never once asks where have you been
She says are you hungry?
Did you eat yet?
Let me hang up your coat
Pass me your hat
All the time she's smiling
Never once raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning
You don't give it a second thought

It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

The sweetest woman in the world
Could be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep hurting her
She'll keep being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That'll really, really hurt you one day

I see you're in the hospital
Bandaged from foot to head
In a state of shock
Just that much from being dead
You couldn't believe the girl
Would do something like this, ha
You didn't think the girl had the nerve
But here you are
I guess action speaks louder than words

It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate",Thin Line Between Love and Hate

I'd been staring at it for hours and hours 
Slipping in and out of consciousness

And my eyes shut tight 
Any wonder that I cannot resist 
Punchin' blindly in a fight 
The first time I saw swans flyin' to the sun 
I wanted to be one 

Like every mother's son 
When I saw my life had begun 
I wanted to be someone 
Like my brother and my one and only father 
And like every mother's son 

I was raised within a cause 
With a purpose to fulfill 
I was taught to defend what was mine 
And instructed not to kill 
My small mortal eyes can see eternity 
In the clouds that dissolve and then regroup endlessly 

Like every mother's son 
When a man showed me how to use a gun 
I wished I'd never need one 
Like my brother and my one and only father 
And like every mother's son 

Everything in domesticity 
Assumes its role better than me 
I'm a displaced person whose culture let me down 
I raise my own daughters in a pornographic town

Pretenders,"I went out on the balcony in the middle of the night 
The hotel was dark except for just one light 
Television burning in the other room 
I couldn't sleep so I put on some of your 
Hollywood perfume

I went out on the balcony and looked across the way 
Some guy was shadow boxing, he looked like sugar ray 
I was feeling dizzy - began to swoon 
Was it his punch or was it just your 
Hollywood perfume? 

I feel like a fugitive escaped from my life 
Seeking refuge in the sensual heat 
These paper-thin walls make me party to calls 
Of love wafting through the room 
The night jasmine bloom 
Of your Hollywood perfume 

I went out on the balcony to clear my head 
I was burning up in my queen-sized bed 
Down on the strip beneath the billboard moon

Neon sex and doom 
Of your Hollywood perfume

And pushed aside your headstone
My favourite samurai

Then you showed me something
I didn't know
How to let go
I was falling
through the tivoli sky
Expecting to fly
Expecting to fly

When I stood beside your tomb last night
Recalling how you rose
Did you think I would persist
Refusing to die
See how I've persisted

Pretenders,"There was a time you thought
I was in love with you
Well think again,
You can't read my thought

I'd like to break your smile in two
You're so correct,
I'd like to disconnect the dots
You're such a child,
But you're not innocent
Another kid for rent

Why do you send me roses?
Save them for someone's death
The love you have to offer
Is only baby's breath

There was a time I thought
You were magnificent
But you've got nothing to have or to hold
You're so pensive 
But your thoughts are insignificant
Wrap 'em up another twenty billion sold
You think you're wild and you know
What danger means
In your designer jeans

Why do you send me roses?
Save them for someone's death
The love you have to offer
Is only baby's breath

I'd like to have you alone tonight
And rearrange your mind
I'd like to have you

Even when we sleep
For some small protection

If it hurts or if it's bliss
Love me from the heart down

With a brain that let's me down
Down...down

But the hunger still remains
You sink into my flesh like a knife

We take off all our clothes
And stand naked face to face
With real life

Get me on the floor
Love me from the heart down
Go under 
And then come back for more

Gives love the run around, around
You can't hold a theory
Won't you love me 
From the heart down

We misconstrue intentions
When there's distance in-between
Longing hurts the teeth
Like something sweet
When you're not here with me
You become a memory
This aching feels 
Like some kind of defeat

Oh love me from the heart down
Get me on the phone
Love me from the heart down

If love was a war
It's you who has won
While I was confessing it

This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

Won't you look at where we've gone
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I fear for you in my mind

In Beirut the hate is burning

And religious fights
There are lethal heroes in time
Are we lethal heroes gone blind
And often I sit and wonder
I clearly hear the thunder
Coming on strongly with the eastern winds
If there's a God in heaven
From whom the Earth was given
Stop this madness that we're living in
While terror and torture
Is raping our lands
Genocide is taking over

Seems out of hand

Left the wastelands
Broke the lines
Crossed the border to another time
Being drawn by the fates
Who run our destinies
Stranded in a state of life

It was aching for more
She was more than complete
Admired and adored
It wouldn't die out
The fire inside her
And still it burns
But the fire has gone

High born, rich man's girl
A white swan in her own little world
Always had more money than sense
She turns her back on those she depended on

It's just a little change of attitude
She never felt this way before
She doesn't know what she'll be going through
She wants more

Young blood
Your future is held
In the hands of a stranger
Young blood
Don't ever give your heart away

Night time, hanging around
Dealing with the wrong guys
On the wrong side of town
A good time on someone's backseat
You've got to get out, but you're dragging your feet

And now you're walking with a bad reputation
Hot gossip going with your name
Two different worlds are such a tough combination
Your heart is bleeding
And you're living in shame

Whatever happened to your dignity
Out where the days have no names
You're left alone with your philosophies
And your dreams

Another lazy day
Another crazy night
Another lonely heart
Has broken up inside
Hanging on the edge
It ain't funny
But that's how it goes
When you trade love for money

Oh whatever happened to your dignity
Don't look away",Young Blood

Do you want to see it all come down?

Pretty Maids,"Don't remember now
Can't recall somehow
Black holes spotting your memory 
So you fell from grace
Tears run down your face
See yourself as the enemy

And now you find yourself
Along the road to nowhere
To find the road leads back to you 
Into obscurity
Where darkness blinds in despair 
You're running scared
Inside the world where you live 
You can be who you want to be

See what you want to see

Until some one hears your calling

Nothing cures the blame
Feel the fear rising from the deep

Razor cross your skin
Better pray for your soul to keep 

What do your see outside
The windows that surrounds you 
Around your twisted human shell 
Now do you hear what other people 
Say about you 
Look at yourself and suffer
Dive into hell you unholy and rotten
Lay down among the abandoned forgotten now

And when you sleep at night
Your friends will come alive

They came at dawn
Into the morning light
Black shadows ridin' on the mist
Prepared for battle
Swords were shinin' bright
Filled with anger and harm
Came to kill not to charm

The sound of metal
Screamin' in the air
The time has come where justice rules
The endless victims
Looking up in fear
Now who were the fools

[Chorus:]
Oh here they come
Riders of the sun
And they will fight
Back to back - back to back

They're fighting hard
Their way of victory
Dead bodies lying on the ground
They are the soldiers of eternity
And their swords spinnin' around

They're fightin' with power, ready to ride let go

They got it all
They'll never fall
But they will fight
The night is fallin'
Light will disappear
A magic silence fills the place
Could read the warning
Shinin' crystal clear
Now they were lost for the chase

Die with dignity
Cry for justice when you long for it

Gonna hold your fire high
Stand up for your reasons
Dead or alive

With evil tyrannic regimes
They rule but they can't kill your

Ignore your demands to be free
Free and break your bonds
Never bow to no one
Cry for justice within you long for it

Pretty Ricky,"Yea, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me
I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people that lived above the
Buildings that I was hustling in front of that called the police on
Me when I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter
And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm saying?

It's all good baby baby

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)
I'm blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)
It's all good (it's aaalll good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a few, but not that many
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin stuff
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin life without fear
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus]

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
Fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all

I'm on a first class trip. 
Through this place called life. 
I don't know what to do. 
'cause my body's still shaking. 
I know it's time to man up. 
And start my education. 
I need someone to call on. 
So I called on my best friend. 
I said ""Bro, I can't take it"". 
He said ""Boy, stop tripping"". 
So I hung up the phone. 
Packed my shit and got right. 
I know what I gotta do now. 
Be a man and face life. 

Maybe we could work it out.

And every time I think about it. 
I know a nigga can't live without you.

I was staying wit my momma. 
I stayed getting in trouble, man. 
Straight damn drama. 
I started dancing so I stayed out of trouble. 
'cause I stayed in school, selling candy so my money doubled. 
But then you told me man, dancing was for punks. 
Then you told me come and stay. 
And you ain't care what I want. 
You told me come and dance and rap wit my brothers. 
You taught me how to love and how to care for my brothers. 
And then you taught me all yo hustlin' skills. 
Just in case I get alone I know how to pay bills. 
You told me I was straight regardless of a deal. 
And I love you man for that 'cause you always kept it real. 

Maybe we could work it out. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
And every time I think about it. 
I know a nigga can't live without you. 
Ain't no need to cry about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
I even wrote a song about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 

Now that I made it, it feel real good. 
Take you out the hood. 
Put you on be	 and the block in the middle of the woods. 
And as hard as it seems, you was there for me. 
One bedroom apartment. 
On 6-0 14 number efficiency down in Coverly. 
Told you I had a dream.
And even though I like to cheat. 
I'm going along my Georgia peach and that's a promise I'm gone keep. 
To the end, never gone blend. 
And I can hear you tell yo friends. 
And I can see you want to buss and fuss with yo brand new Benz. 
To the world, baby it's yours. 
I'd give you the world 'cause you not no ordinary girl. 
I'm yo son, you my ol' girl. 
My momma, we shared for 19 years. 
And from the bottom of my foundation I'm telling you how I feel,

See, I fell in love wit ya. 
want to raise my kids wit ya. 
But you left me all alone wit tears dripping down the picture. 
I remember the day like yesterday. 
May 9th, to be exact. 
I'd do anything to get you back. 
Even though I know you ain't coming back. 
I'm serious as a heart attack. 
Could we get it back the way it was? 
'cause I know you had some outside influences that pulled a plug. 
The reality, Junebug, girl I know we'll always be together. 
I got you locked away deep in my heart, always here forever. 

Maybe we could work it out. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
And every time I think about it.

Pretty Ricky,"Yeah Yeah Yeah
Baby let me lay ya down
On the carpet when I come round
Get rug burns when I tear ya down
On the ground all I want to hear is that ooh ah sound
I'ma push up on ya slow
Get ya right by the end of the night
Do something sweet 
Like massage ya feet
And put Pretty Ricky cd on repeat 
Then get an ice cream and put in work
Go to the kitchen for a lil' dessert
I love butter pecan ice cream
Eat cake but I lick off the icing
Maxin' and relaxing
I'm guaranteeing satisfaction
Give you fast or slow back action
Depending on your reaction girl

It's seven in the evening
And everybody's leaving
I decided to stay in
I just felt like chilling
And I wondered if you felt the same
Just say the word, I'll be on my way
I'm just a few, few blocks away
I just want to see your pretty face

All I'd like to do 
Is lay with you tonight
I don't want to hit the club
I want to lay ya
(And when I come over) 
I'll get you right
(I will)
Get you right
(I will)
Get you right
We can do anything that you want to do
And before I go home 
I'll get you right

I pictured me holding you
I pictured you holding me
We can watch a movie girl
I just bought some brand new dvd's
And I wondered if you felt the same
Just say the word, I'll be on my way

When I leave my house 
I hope that you'll be looking for me
And you'll be waiting for me
Cause I will
I'll be speeding on the way
And when I get there
I'll get you right

You called my phone and told me
""Baby come through""
I said unlock the door
And I'll be there in a few
Brought ""Love and Basketball""
and ordered some food
Now it's time to do 
All the things that you want to do boo
Open the door, look it back 
And head into the room
Pop in a movie, hit the lights 
And lay next to you
Cuddle under the covers
Kissing and hugging
While I get you right
Forget the club and going out
Baby I'm spending the night

It feel like heaven when I'm with ya
Baby I just want to chill with ya
Spend some time with ya
Wine and dine with ya
In my mind I'm painting a beautiful picture
Me and you spending Q.T.
On the low key, baby we overseas
Knocking boots like H-town
You holding me girl
You got me feenin' like Jodeci
This is where I want to be
With you screaming 
We out here so what they do
Cause baby I'm so in love with ya
Everywhere I go I got your picture
Baby I miss ya
I just want to spend some time with ya

All I'd like to do

I don't want to hit the club
I want to lay ya

Bust in you like atomize
I'ma ahead of my class gettin' head in the jag
Look in the duffel bag see Benjamin heads on the cash

I got new shoes on the ride (yes sir)
Rollin' down 95 (yes sir)
And you can see in my eyes (yes sir)
That I'm lookin' for a cutie pie (yes sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (yes sir)
And we can just cuddle up (yes sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (yes sir)
Then dammit, I'll beat it up (yes sir)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)

Top down blue star tag
Ol' master bear skin rugs in the jag
Spectac with the bad chick in the back
Tryin' ta beat it up like an Everlast punching bag
Hotter than a bisquick biscuit out the oven
Your baby mama go on missions to get this lovin'
We kissin' and huggin' she never pick her phone up
You be lookin' for her while we doin' the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms,
But she love when she get the back to back orgasms
Yes sir, the game is automatic, give it to 'em one time
They come back like addicts.

Right lookin' smellin' good
Lookin' good Spec and Baby Blue and Pleasure Fool
That's all we got!
Let me drop my top pull up in the parking lot
Grab a grape soda bag of chips
That's all I got
Park outside minglin' wit' my homeboys
Faked out fake hugs leave me alone boy
Plus the candy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls actin' cross the street
But on the other hand
Alfalfa Just hit me on my metro
Say a party in the park hard baby let's go
The balla tick no questions asked, so I jumped out the white jag
Smooth like Shaq come her girl!

Be your special delivery at your door
Leave your body shaking and shivering on the floor
Can you handle how I deal with this sexual healing
Your body like math divided in half.
You ain't gotta close this door
Just take them clothes off
Girl I'm bout to break you off
I'm feeling on your body and your skin's soft
If you wanna say no then that's your loss
I never go soft never go raw
Turn the telephone off

Swinging that thing tearing down your walls

'cause tonight it's only me and you
Yeah yeah whoa
Let me do you after school like some homework
But please don't give me no STD's
I'm gonna leave it up to you to please me
Age ain't nothing but a number
You don't need id for me
I'll be your lover undercover
And you ain't gotta tell your mother we're in love with each other
Because our first chance to romance
We can sneak away and take trip to France with your friends
But tonight I'm all yours
Leave it up to you to devour this full course
With dessert of course
So what you waiting for
You're stuttering saying gimme gimme more gimme gimme gimme more

[Chorus]

Let's take our time slow it down
I'm gonna show you how a real player get down
I'm a blue star baby ain't no pressure
Come over here let me lift your dress up
On the dresser what's your pleasure
Call up the maid and she can clean the mess up
Don't say nothing baby hold that thought

Every thing I do is messed up
You got me torn up
Like Latoya Luckett
Wanna drop it in your bucket
I'm a player tryna crush it
I can tell that you want it
Oh honey you got my feelings involved
I wanna cuff it
Been 2 weeks 4 days 1 hour
And I still ain't touch it
I wanna put it in your stomach like some Robitussin
Your body language telling me you want the same thing
You not no ordinary girl 'cause you're my main thing
This ain't no guessing game
I'm not tryna play hang man
Show you things, buy you things
Oh you're a sexy thing
Ice in your earring
Ice on your pinky ring
Ice on your tongue ring
That's ice on my ding-a-ling

Pretty Ricky,"That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you
No no no

See I came at it, and I came at it, now I'm so addicted like a gambling habit
'cause you was the one here, when I ain't have it
Now you say you leaving me but I ain't having it
We put too much in just to pull out
This thing's just too good for me to pull out
Girl you know pleasure can't stand to see you crying
So I'm gonna love you or die trying

That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you
No no no

I reminiscence on the way that it was
(first kiss, first hug)
24-7 you was on my mind
(baby girl you was my first love)
We closer than the pages in my composition book
(but I let you walk in front so them other players could look)
And when they tried to holla, you point at me and say that you took
(and you've been in my heart before I know that you can cook)
Girl you shine like brand new dime,
The love I have for you is more than all my chicks combined

That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you
No no no

See pleasure is pain, and pain is love
First kiss, first touch, first hug
God had send you up from above,
2 jitterbugs on the back of the bus kissing like we grown up's...
But we broke up, all the pain we went through is on us..
A couple months went by, then we woke up
Break up to make up, girl you know us...
And you then try, but they'll never be able to do the things that you do
They ain't got your style, your body and smile,
They ain't really off the chain like you
Because I showed you how to ride it, and you showed me how you like it
When it is time for that good loving, you read my mind like a psychic
So whenever I'm gone, you worry 'bout your king to return to the throne,
That's why our love is strong,
And you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout me doing wrong,
Just long as you come back home
'cause this where you suppose to be,
Right here close to me,
On the side of me, baby girl you can ride with me,
'cause with you, that's where I'm tryna be you know
I love you girl!

That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you
No no no

You know I love you, frozen cup your wrist, so I can spoil you, hold you..
Never ignore you, adore you, when times get hard, I'll do anything for you...
Remember back in the days, parkway, catch an early matinee at the emine'
Rubbing oil of olay on yo body, hot tamalae,
but 'cause you're my shorty life passes by when you're busy
Making plans I'm a bigger man, a veteran, a business man, a gentleman,
I know you're so sick and tired of my ignorance,
I can't breathe, I can't get no sleep, without you my life is incomplete,
Picnic's at a party, and corn on the cob, real talk,
from the start, you got the keys too
My heart, that's a promise to god.

That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you

We ain't going to the club

Verse1:
My niggas handcuff bringing broads in to town cause
We in the trenches where its fucking going down.
Where da G's at
......without probable cause watch the G's react.
Move fool like they don't exist
Put lick on his chevy and hi frozen wrist
And grind most sported dickie for another day
Linking up with niggas that get it the same fucking way
.......go getta fuck the club, lets get paid
We enter a small town, distributing all around,
Plenty time for pussy, right now put down cause

Business before pleasure, speaking of pleasure
My R&B road dawg, we hwaded up to Tennessee then to Mississippi 
Where its got the vicious clicks more conscerned with paper.
Not here for the clubbin' shit.
But niggas think I'm trippin'
Like sumthin' must be wrong wit him.
Really rather rob rappers, fuck doing song wit'em.

Pretty Tone Capone,"I was the third brother of five
Doing whatever I had to do to survive
I'm not saying what I did was alright
Trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day fight

Been down so long, getting up didn't cross my mind
I knew there was a better way of life that I was just trying to find
You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
Across 110th Street is a hell of a tester

Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free
Across 110th Street
Woman trying to catch a trick on the street
Across 110th Street
You can find it all in the street

I got one more thing I'd like to y'all about right now

Hey brother, there's a better way out
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope man you're copping out
Take my advice, it's either live or die
You've got to be strong, if you want to survive

The family on the other side of town
Would catch hell without a ghetto around
In every city you find the same thing going down
Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town

Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free

Why can't I call myself Pretty (Pretty)
If you thugged out, cleaned up, seen us, all black
truck and blinged up
Big bucks must be made and not truss  
No one can do it betta' than us, so playa what
I'm a small cat, but I'm ready for action
When it comes to freakin' women
I get down like Jesse Jackson, I'm maxin'
Man, I'm as cool as a fan, in Dark Times
All cats, leavin' ya straight for Frontline
But the haters keep on talkin' to me daily (daily)
The hell with conversation playa, pay me (pay me)
Got safe, got me out the cracks (the slums)
I'm a playa rockin' shows leavin' record ???, it's fun
Hard work and dedication will pay, just a dose of
Pretty Willie will keep the doctor away
What more can I say, the truth and nothin' but the truth 
But for them haters that didn't want it
yo this one's for you (I'm like)

[Chorus: 2x]
Na Na Na Na Naaa (Na Na Na Na Naaa)
Naaa Na Na Na Naaa (Naaa Na Na Na Naaa)
I'm just Suella, makin' my life betta'
Got crème, feddy, and chedda', ready to do whatever

[Verse]
It seem like y'all (y'all) cats (cats)
Claimin' to be real, y'all need to stop (stop) that
(that)
Cause when it come to rhymin' it's like a storm, did that
Avoidin' them cats, them oily gats
So looks like were sergeant, they can geuss
My ride is stoppin' all y'all like stop signs
More cock than a glock 9, shoot nineteen times
When it come to rhyme, it seem like y'all addicted to mine 
Makazumas line up in a single-file line 
Ready to hit it hot (hold up)
That dawg spit like that bunny the dummy 
I can't quit droppin' hits, the day, for me to getcha 
The first realla, to fake y'all like George Gipper, the big gimper
On a scale of 1 to 10, I can't be like you
Wack lil' crews I choose the souf like their a flu
What you would, chill and freeze, boy please
Fatality for tease don't make my mission complete

[Chorus]

[Verse]
There's no way
You sorry bustas gon' take me
There's no way
You sorry bustas gon' take me
There's no way
You sorry bustas gon' take me
There's no way, no way, no way

Prevent Falls,"I took her out in the cold.
To explain myself.
But seeking positive change.
Was not something she could tell.
Apologies she assaulted with her attacks.
She's so goddamned ignorant.
I hope she thought this was worth it.

I'm going to back down.
You just dug the hole.
You made a promise I won't forget.
I'm going to remove.
My whole life from you.
Please don't support me.
I hate you.

And I've tried so many times.
To make a change.
She sobered me up.
With all the things she said.
But to think I would tolerate.

This is another bet.
To insult my friends.
And the relations of this band.
Don't show your fucking face again.
Or I will make this hell.
And you try to take my pride away.",No More Brazil

Crossing bridges never burned

Is this all that I have learned
Looking for a diamond in the dark 
I was sure you were the one 
You held me spellbound while you made your mark
Now the damage has been done 

Goodbye girl it's a game we play everytime we say
Goodbye girl you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye

I'm afraid when i turn out the light
Words you say while you're asleep
Where you were and what you did last night 
Those are secrets you can keep

Tied to you blood on the wire
Don't you know you push me much too far
Just who do you think you are
I can't escape, must all roads lead to Rome 
Everytime I say goodbye you hypnotize",Goodbye Girl

Without your love I'm lost
Let's give us another chance,

Believe is what you need to feel

Just let it go Preem

Z06 'vette, gripping feeling almost there
Listening to Bon Jovi, rolling 'Living on a Prayer'
Privy to the gossip, that's what's said about me constant
It's the life and times of Bumpy Johnson meets Nucky Thompson
I used to rap about death, now I'm only concerned to live
I value relationships, still I keep it competitive
Nowadays chances are that if you see me throw the match
It ain't to lose the fight, it's to walk away from a burning bridge
I'm from a family of alcoholics and coke addicts
Daddy taught me if the ass is so fat it's a fact
That if you with your ho, don't matter it's still appropriate to scope at it
Living life with no balance, driving drunk on co-pilot
Driving 'till I total it
I'm trying to stay afloat, but I got nobody to throw a rope at it
The game is just a game of splits and politics with no ballot
All kind of clips with mo' malice than Pusha
If you profiling, it's probably be more violence than looking
I'm so stylish, but I ain't talking eBay, no high end fashion either
If you catch me by the runway it's the one that's for the PJ
This one is for my lyricists - courtesy of my DJ

(I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts)
(Hustle hard in any hustle that you pick)
(I respect that)
I done had a lot of niggas say they wanna hurt me
Somehow, some way they just end up in my mercy
Just show some courtesy
(Hell yeah, nigga you know, niggas still got it)
(Believe that shit)

I got killas 'round the way ready to move that work for me
Niggas wanna ride my wave, bitches wanna surfboard me
All I want is courtesy, who cares about the radio?
And you can take the cassette deck from off your old boombox
And it wouldn't matter
It still squares on your radio to keep your
Wealth
I learned to stay to yo - self
I call for Shantelle to spray paint a mural in Watts
Of me spray painting a mural of Miracle Watts
Shoutout to Michael 5000 Watts
I'm on than lean movement like I'm out here tryna box
Look, nigga, this is a boss thing, uh
Meaning you getting the laze dot to your offspring
I'm a lost being, uh
Try to cross me without falling off, I'm afraid not
I'm a frayed knot like a draw string
I'm preaching to the congregation like I'm Peter Popoff
If you can imagine
Me hopping up out of the cabin like I'm one of the dukes of hazard
Like fuck it, leave the top off like time for foreplay
That last line that was before ya time
Like Big Ben sitting in Beyoncé doorway
While I'm receiving Four Seasons, Norwegian top in Norway
Listening to rappers kick knowledge
That they probably got from Toure'
These Michael Eric Dyson niggas claiming they king
Not knowing the kind of drama that that bring
Imma be the first established rapper to hop in that battle rap ring Turn that to gatling
My next album gon be so dark and so fly
I should CD package it wrapped in batwings
The Soultrain music awards actors rock fake as wrestling
Dressed bottom to top in leather looking like bacon in Vaseline
How you looking like beef jerky, beefing in every verse
But never beefing in person? Randy Savage
You wouldn't snap a slim Jim
You wouldn't rip a wrapping on Christmas in Santa's attic
With the hands of Eddie Scissors, ain't you average?
Put your motherfucking hands up
My job is to move the crowd, move the motherfucking crowd
Put your motherfucking hands up",Courtesy
PRhyme,"Dat sound good there

I'm just a - I'm just a -
(Dat sound good right here)
I'm just a regular chilling with thugs and legends
I got deceased contacts in my phone I never delete
I keep my cellular plugged into Heaven
Somebody nudge the reverend
Tell him I'm selling a white girl like I'm Starbucks, Uggs and leggings
All of these hugs and kissy emojis killin' my foe, G
All of these soldiers killin' 'em for me
I told her I'ma chill but still I'm a OG
Wish I could go back in time and keep it real with my old lady
I asked if she'd rather deal with a dope tree
Or would she rather deal with my cold feet
That's a wild question
May the best man win and may I be the best man I can be
Everywhere I'm at but my wedding
Get live rounds from guns that are gigantic
Cause you wouldn't bow down like the front of the Titanic
You're gonna die, dammit
I'm bringin' drama through your homicidio like I'm tryna say ""homicide"" in Spanish
My nigga Joell Ortiz said

Dat sound good there

I'm in tip-top condition, with a hustler's ambition
I'm sick of hip-hop, I should be in the damn kitchen
Whippin' somethin' potent for the chosen clientele
All the smoke that I inhale, I'm 'posed to be high as Hell
But that's a twisted figure of speech, Hell is below you
I'm guaranteed Heaven before I'm beneath the soil
Toyin' with the squad, that's how you get sent to God, dog
You know it's backwards to go against God, dog
Whoever gets a whiff of the base is loaded like the World Series
Steve Jobs died, now the world Siris
(I respect you) and that's serious as a heart attack
I'm an ancient artifact, we question if your art is fact
In fact, you gassed up like you're hard to match
Leave you ablaze, extinguish your remains
I'm the leader of this game, old school or new
Old Soul, but my shoes is new

Dat sound good there

A bunch of poison in my blood stream
Now it's gettin' ugly, I must be another junky
How lucky am I to still be alive? I'm goin' crazy
Bought a Mercedes with money I raised for Haiti
Abducted Brenda's baby, sold it to a gay couple
Take drugs too, high enough to juggle with some space shuttles
Your worst nightmare, breathin' all the white air
Inhale, exhale (that sound good right there)
Yeah, the unforgettable walkin' bicentennial mint
Born an idea, was never a man
I'm with Ab-Soul the asshole, Nickel Nine and Primo
Shit, Larry Fish, he brought the technicolor dream coke
I'm spittin' on the face of evil

How much did I use to drink
I tell 'em off the top of my head about a gallon, kinda like Pharrell's hat

I'm liable to store somebody's corpse in the closet, I'm organized
Before police was interrogatin', I was livin' the story of my life
And Morgan Freeman was narratin'
(Say it again) I'm 5'9"", not an inch taller
'Fore all of the jewelry, I've been baller
Before niggas was hypebeasts, my niggas was bike thiefs
You let it out your sight and they take it to sight see

(Why) we ain't vacayin' out of state
Whinin' all the time, all she do was holler
We ain't like a Pagan holiday
Rappers will, be actin' ill
Know when they die for deals
I take the word ""lyrical"" and flip it backwards
And that says ""laciryl""

I'll give up drinkin' when she give her emotions up

I body the beat and watch it skip, call it m-murda

The gang that don't tweet simultaneous for the sake of the sermon

Other groups basic mergers
We extort 'em from a distance, takin' it further
Drama could be all yours, why you want a war for?
You can't go at uno, mothafucka, that's a draw 4

Fuck around now, you on the bleachers soon as Joe point

Could've been copped the Phantom, copped the Benz bein' humble
Still, the nickel plate is known to get 'em situated
It's return fire, even when Joey initiate it
How I feel about these rap niggas? Fuck 'em all
Drake rhyme about these bitches, I just fuck 'em all
A hundred guns, jeans big enough to tuck 'em all
Banana clips, fully automatic, you can't duck 'em all

From the sky, could really be rainin' cats and dogs

I still write like it's my son was born knight
I'm tired of swinging on these niggas
Man, these niggas can't even fight
I'm a casual sneaker head, I don't need them bleeding on my Nikes
Marshall said that I'd be a problem if I get my shit right
That if it's probably the biggest if I ever live by
Which is why I'm known as a underachiever, I just skip by
I need it to be inebriated to prevent me from getting shy
That's better than getting shot, that's a much healthier ending
I'm running this race all by myself
My competition is in the selfie olympics
Coming back with a vengeance in LV vintage
Anybody got a problem with me winning his shit shall be offended

You don't know what it feels like to be tired of fucking these hoes
It's just hard to stay alive these days
I can't end up on no more collages on bitches' IG pages

Just another day in my reformed life, my unreformed mic
I still write like it's my son was born knight
I'm tired of cheating on my wife, man, these bitches just ain't right
Can't even kiss them in their mouths
Too many dicks been in their diet
Me and Chris we veterans, but when youngins call you vet
You start to feel like Hardaway with that UTEP, two step
They come in the league like A.I
With that their look and that crossover
Moving that make their old shit seem useless
But I'm balling
I can afford to hire somebody

But I never lost no bitches chasing money, how real is that?
Only time a woman made a man a millionaire
Was when that man was a former billionaire, how trill is that?
My nigga, get you a fly chick and a drop top
And when she piss you off, do me a favor
Hop in that bitch and peel it back
I already got one
All these bitches be doing is playing musical chairs
With different rappers' front seats without calling shotgun
Face it, you're a ho, as God as my witness
That paper's my litmus I take it then I dip with it
Then I wait for the result

Couple of niggas had to off 'em
Couple of bitches mad cause I'm off 'em
Either that or they think that my life is so good my nights be sunny
Oh, he's only been so quiet

Million dollar maker, not a faker, try to call me over the hill
It's probably cause you saw me chillin' beside a pile of paper
Life's a Picasso painting, psyche, my life's more like an obstacle, ain't it?
Like it's somethin' in front of the drop, and I gotta ride around it
On my way to make me another child support payment
From humble beginnings, though we live lavishly now
And what we couldn't afford to get, we would have it somehow

Rubbin' our hands together like Baby with cameras around

Genetically predisposed to be a mechanic or less
I handle my failures way better than I ever handled success
And I let you boys be the loudest, holdin' my 44
From '94, on my retro kick before I let you let go clips
I'll let Michael Jordan be my stylist
I'll rock one of them baggy ass Tracy McGrady suits

Than Kanye critiquin' at Steve Madden

I took the breathalyzer out the cop's hand and tried to drink it

Your favorite rapper's up at LIV
While I'm on controlled substances, search around my crib for a fuck to give
But I couldn't find it
My notebook should be made of a wooden binder
Cause that's what my albums be sellin'
But I don't give a fuck about nothin' but good vagina
Long as these niggas call me GOAT
If I don't get through to you the call failed
Cause I was probably on that Wolf of Wall Street boat, I'm a hard sell
Maybe too lyrical for 'em
The Lord gave me a choice to either be king or give all Hell
I chose the latter like a fireman climbin' up to a charred rail
In front of Miley, starin' a giant wreckin' ball
Miss me with your mollies and your Tyrese wisdom
I don't connect with y'all and these antics
Today you give your life to the game
Tomorrow you be posin' in pictures, lookin' like Steve Francis
You ain't turnin' up, you're bein' backhanded like Pete Sampras
About that, I missed my uncle's funeral to go to South by Southwest

The valleys and the alleys where the gods switch to bitch mode
I came through, the Harley pipe was loud like a lion
The title on the marquee said ""Child out of Zion""
Contemplatin' on another plane, hoverin' down lover's lane
Won a great debate against the state about the mother plane
He called me by that other name, I called him by his other name
The lightnin' struck the internet like a screen door in a hurricane
Jay Electricity, baptized by Felicity
Where he been the past three years? It's just a mystery
If it ain't come from one of my peers, it ain't a diss to me
I'm a thousand leagues under the sea, niggas can't get to me
The F in my middle name with the period stands for ""Victory""
I came from the bottoms of Hell with Jezebels
Sniffin' blow with her friends in the dens of iniquity
When I was young, I was confused, I thought God was a mystery
But everything I knew since the time I began to grew
Was taught to me by the wickedest men, who twist the histories
Who pulled out the cuffs of deception and and hitched their wrist to we
Now all praises due to Allah, we seein' crystally
The Pyramids are there to bear witness to the gods
So when the angels heard me spit, they bit their lip, this shit is hard
Utterly unstoppable, in high school I was voted most popular
By the unpopular, phantom of the chakras

To you, it's what you do)

Fix your coat, prepare for 40 below spit
Seven days of Heaven's ways and Hell's hangups
Chris and Ryan again and we wishing anybody
Who wasn't wishing us well bankrupt
A L and whatever else ain't up
As far as me I'm still caught up in all that gun shit
Still calling my bullets expendables 'cause it's hard to believe
I can fit all of them boys in one clip
I squeeze off and the streets start trembling
It's way too many niggas that seen shit, too many witnesses
Up and down with their visions of what a street nigga is
I call it the See-Saw Syndrome
Syndrome maybe you make a mistake, you lose
And this is for the real hip-hop niggas
Who will never ever ever ask me am I here to replace Guru

Word, that's what you feel up in this track?
Let a bitch nigga try to shit on that (oh what you trying to rap now?)

Yeah, yo Royce (what up, man)
We just lamping in the studio you know, doing our thing (Okay)
Bugging out, you know (Right)

Rumor has it I'm an underground king
All I give a fuck about is money
And when I got it, I don't give a fuck about it
It's outlandish, I take for granted what God granted
My countertop granite, my house is outstanding
While I'm standing inside of it
Feelin' inside out as I pop Xanax
Watching myself on TV
In order to get to the TV I had to go through the proper channels
I don't rock the flannel, I rock the Air Max, Atmos and camo
They call me the Benz owner, I put Lorenzo's on it
Then go and pick a chick up, bone it and friend zone her
Soon as I see her wake up, I be fuckin' her raw
If she a B or an A cup, make her fuck in a bra
Let's get it goin', got a dyke in the closet
I'm sure she enjoyin', I kill verses in return for it
A eulogy is borin', for you to be informed
I'm a chore and my circle change more than a European coin
Once the kill has begun, you realize
I'm the illest, the realest is Pimp C, and the trillest is Bun
I'm definitely best at gun rap, gun wrap
I put you on my recipe list
I put you on the treadmill accessory less like run that, run that
Detroit nigga, I destroy niggas in general
I deploy niggas to generally destroy niggas' regimes
So rumor has it I'm an underground king

From underground, a number one, I don't get it
I still be in Civics, it's one of my bitcHes', I grew witH the clip
And I'm known for the stripping, unload 'til I end it
Put ten in a tank, 10 mil' in my bank, I'm more real tHan you tHink
Buy a bitcH some High Heels, a small purse and a sHank
Some wet naps, a little skirt to insert tHrough a sHape
I'm in the gun wraps, I say tHem gun raps, I brougHt tHe guns back
And sHowin' gang tats
And wHen I wrote tHis Had every H capped
You know tHem Hoovers 'bout it, 'bout it, I serve bullets
And narcotics, the cops watcHin', still poppin'
A gang member, pitcHin' rock, every car on the block
No antennas, just a body, myself and my own Hitta
I'm Top Dawg, you cat litter
Denied a million tHrougH a text, I'm a real nigga
From Heaven to the lowest of devils
Spit every bar for the rebels
My wardrobe to startin' trouble: orange rags
Bucket Hats, even be witH my stunt double
My life is either jail or oxy in my cotton
You lookin' pale and so it's gon' be for the knockin'
[?] 45, it's only 3 options
I'm second to none, I shoot 'til I won, gun bigger than Bun
Take more tHan your lung, pop, pop, pop
Convert to a Hearse, get a new top dropped, yawk yawk
Murder music, jump out of Buicks
Nobody movin' or I squeeze on it
Before I get a crown, I bleed on it

An underground king sippin' my lean
You know I double my profit because I triple my beam
You niggas stop with the topics and all this fussin' and arguin'
Ain't it clear to your optics that I would go through a squadron?
Cause I'm as violent and vicious as killin' Christians and Christians
On the eve of a Christmas, say we got sick and sadistic
I'm talkin' tangled and twisted, this shit was terror-terrific
We killed the hubby and kiddies, murdered the dog and the misses
And made the maid do the dishes, now she sleep with the fishes
Now that sucka rapper's dead, I assume my position
In the place, a king, on the throne is where I'm sittin'
Yeah, the iron throne is mailed with the metal microphone
Hey, let the rats and the mice know Killer Mike is home
Cause Killer is iller than all the killas they know
My past is good, I land a rock at my show
Before I go, rest in peace to Dilla fosho
Slum lord with a mic cord in a slum village on a slum tour
Through every ghetto I carry the heavy metal
Just in case a shovel is needed when arguments are settled
Mama get rose petals
That's it, finito, no chatter, the matter settled
I got your bitch, I got some head, she got stilettos
Lyrically I'm literally a bad mothafucka

PRhyme,"I'm sending my killers to the store for Patron and Danish
My nigga, my nigga, I would go get it myself, but I'm famous
And I ain't never changing, I'm never done paying my dues
My mind frame is ""I'm forever making my payments""
I walk by a so called tough guy, watch him tuck his chain in
No snatching though, watch what you put my fucking name in
Kind of like an armless actor playing an action role
I'm out on the west copping like Axel Foley, ask the police
But at least I'm active though
I bought my bitch an Aston, wrote it off on my taxes
Listed it as an independent backing like Macklemore
Half of my clique is bastards
The other half of my clique don't know half of the kids they having
Savage, that's average though
Like 30k a year spent on yeast
In order to walk in the streets
In my shoes, you're gon need Flintstone feet
And room for baggage, and room in your Nikes
So they can hypothetically tag your toe
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more about rhyme no more
Cause I'm so raw, will I win?
Ain't an if, it's a when
Kind of like asking ""what time is karma gon find [?]""
So tomorrow, in hindsight, if you an artist, death's near, the fans know
What you draw falls on deaf ears like Van Gogh
I chose rap glory over the stratosphere
No plaques or a trophy, I already have them here
(Let's go, Preem)
I'm just trying to leave my mark but I've got the same backstory as a tatted tear
The kind of frame I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothing about Budden, I suppose
I propose to all my girls too
I'm in the Forbes in in a pearl suit
Bitches know the score like Sheryl Swoopes
You know they say that you dying if you ain't living good
I'm dumping a hit man's salary worth of quarters down the world's largest wishing well
Wishing a nigga would
(Wishing a nigga would)

Ladies and gentlemen
I think my record speaks for itself

A rival of survival, idle movement and chatter
We was stepping in the Chi before we knew the ladder
Climb up till your time's up, but daily reminder
My daily operation is to spark the population
Salutation to the nation of the Nubians and hooligans
That knew me when we was boxing niggas up in Julian
The bond that I have with the Quran and the math
Supreme talk, I'm walking a king's walk
Watch it vibrate, while I take the wings off
Straight out of Chitown where they get that lean off
Fiends cough for serum, hitters rally rally like it's Durham
You in Illinois, we don't know what can cure 'em
I'm sicker than most of them from the 'Go so the flow don't end
Come get it bae like you from Oakland
I'm in the building and this my grand opening
I'm posturing with niggas that were supposed to been
Doper than, more pussy than fallopian

These are the sounds of days that are passed

Kick in the door waving the .44
Casing the floorboards, stays in the Waldorf
I will board a jet cheap, fly the way for sure to get deep
To show your crew my immortal technique
I'll elaborate, sixteen pistols and extendos
Hidden inside three or four twelve hundred crates
If we at war, I'll exaggerate
Sweep up the streets till the clique clean
Shoot you while we watch the tables turn like a twig scene
Street sweeper, knock his head clean off his body
Then keep sweeping long enough to clean off his body
Lean off the bottle then fly a nigga queen off to Cabo
Then have her feeding me papayas and grapes, I'm an acquired taste
If you don't like me, acquire some taste
And all I talk about is murdering
All you do is test pros, I'll shoot you while you protest
Shout to all my brothers and my sisters out in Ferguson
The police want us shot
And you gon be the next to drop in front of that donut shop

We record a new dimension of history

I kick my habits of visvum
Sneakers and developed into the new now
With Animal Planet I got me a plaque
And a Grammy well I'm goin' zoo now
Me still be irrelevant, then became the elephant
In the room now (is he gon' ever fall off)
No, I walk by a so called tough guy
Watch him pass me nervous, after I passed him
He gon' get what the street life for
He gon' turn the other cheek like
A half done assed job, sittin right
In front of a plastic surgeon
Then I jump in the black suburban
Snatch the curtain, wrappin' your R&B act in it
After I squeeze 21 entries, and it ain't no need to ask for ID's
I'm certain that if you offend me, that it shall get windy
And it's right before that Mack 10 is workin', click
And it ain't no I in me in the fact that I am
Givin' you fire, and the fire comes after the Earth Wind
Wooh, Preme in his Prhyme, I'm in my Prhyme",Wishin'

I'm going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not
Can I prove it?
Yes
No more days like those

Allow me to put some sense on you coons
Too much success, um, here comes your doom
They told you niggas the sky's the limit
Then they turn around and tell you that there's footprints on the moon
You rise to fame and die, so they can say that you barely won
And they keep your masters, your kids become bastards
Having to ask executives for their daddy records
Sounding like blind Melle, jelly son?
Look in my eyes, you can tell I'm violent
I might go diving inside a fine female on the Maldives island
I vow to never fail my phonics until I'm real iconic
And you can throw me in a cell, I got it
I go to jail bout eight go ""oh well"" then post bail bout nine-ish
I treat that bitch like it's a hotel, check in it then check out it
Then tell my niggas, let the rest doubt it
These rap niggas bugged out like divas
They drugged out thugged out receivers
I meet them at their stash place, heat them
Then tell them they better drag race the fuck away from me
Or get their mug shot like Bieber
I catch him at the bus stop while he reading
This .45 will give him the same holler luck's got
I represent the must haves and whatnots
Niggas that used to cut class to touch cash and buck shots

You should know
(So what you saying yo, keep playing y'all niggas will burn)

Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's being born, same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end
You on a block playing killer with your knife
Without a gun you're an option
Be cut out for the game
Or they're gon play rock, paper, scissors wit your life
I'm usually more spiritual at night
Cause murder's in the air more like a pimping Nike
Whipping bike, the white American kryptonite
Living a scripted life
A different picket, different type
Whoever fixing chicken rice, I'll spend the night
In the morning go home to my wife
Before she try and sell my shit
Ninety nine percent sure that she gon try and smell my dick
Thirsty niggas is praying the hell I slip
The baddest bitches, the last bitches you would've ever imagined
Would've had chlamydia getting dragged to cities
City after city niggas paying cash for the love of ass and titties

(Pick it up)
I don't know why y'all so highly regarded
You rhyme like you're borderline mildly retarded
I show you what my father done started
A rhyme on a god level, the godliest artist
Y'all follow artists who target their audience
But not me, I target the artist, follow the target
Holding a strap, pointing it at sinners
And that's when I tell them like Kobe to Shaq
You lazy and I'm tired of your jogging
Shoot at their feet till the dance start
I'm going H.A.M. in the slaughterhouse
Fuck you and your damn charts
And your crowd participation
I'm putting a land mine under your stage
Had his place raining fan parts
And called that shit crowd precipitation
I'm more premier than my own DJ and Pac's brother
I came out of my momma's womb with a box cutter
Lyrical spitting image that mirrors the birth of Slim
None of these rappers can work with me, I work with them

You should know
(But you don't really want nothing)
You should know

From a chin in a hand in a thoughtful pose

Sit around for fifty years and then collect a pension,
Started seeing the road to hell and just where it starts
But my life is more than a vision
The sweetest part is acting after making a decision
I started seeing the whole as a sum of its parts

My life is part of the global life

You are all my heart beats for, I see my future tonight

Stretch into years and still I wander

Then suddenly
She vanished in the night

And block out the light of day

What changed to make the difference, how could it all
Go wrong

How we lost the thread that held us
Spellbound in a dream

The very moment when I saw your face
All traffic stopped, I held you breathless
I melted into you and lost all sense of time and space

Had surely leny a glove
In conducting our life's symphony

So I'll leave you in that coffin for God
And I'll leave you in the dirt

Do what my heartbeat warns
When my wager is high
Well I've been high before
And you can't stop me on my roll

I was a lonely one, and I'm down on my own
Out in the morning sun and I'm down to the bone
And I've been living like a dog
Do what my hearbeat warns
When my wager is high
Well I've been high before
And you can't stop me on my roll

Priestess,"Waiting on a call to start your day
Waiting for a clever thing to say
I say nothing that I really feel

Work and hope that there's a chance to play
Money's great until it slips away
Well you know that prides a wheel
And I've been dwelling in the ditch for years
But I can't complain

I can't complain
'Cause there's no real pain

I've known loads of friends who went insane
I've seen many lives go down the drain
I've got buddies who've sold their souls and it hurts
I've even seen death before
But I can't complain",No Real Pain
Priestess,"Some say happiness is a burden
As I lie here trying to attain
Inside outside I'm nothing
But the more I see through the more I have to gain

If at first you don't succeed its normal
But the second time you're expected to perform
We perform
Stand up, listen, ill tell you where we went wrong

Give me a reason to stop asking
I know that some things can't be mine
Inside outside I'm nothing
And the layers crumble one piece at a time

if you expect me to go out there and shine every night
You know there's something about that that just isn't right

And it leaves me in charge
She don't pay what the salary will
And no company car
And it hurts when it pounds along with this heartbeat
Well its taking its toll, but it won't for very long

I'll run home, I'm gone

Back to the factory wheel
Believe me I'm in charge
I fell back on a factory girl
But they take me apart
And it hurts when they pound along with this heartbeat
And if I leave it this way, then it won't be there at all

I'm back to the factory wheel
And it keeps me coming home

Priestess,"When I don't call and you wait
I guess it seems I'm abominable
Then I'm late and I sleep in

Late at night, we're in bed
I can be like a dog
The heatings off, and you're warm
I don't feel like catching a cold

In any case, you don't care
You don't feel like rubbing it in
When I'm outside in the pouring rain
I know you'll let me in

I give you all that I got
You never have to ask
You give me love and I know that its
The best ill ever have, and that's why

Hey my babe
I can't sleep when you're not in town
Hope that you know
I get the shakes when you're not around
In my window
You see a sad pathetic clown
I want you to know
I get the shakes when you're not around

Now its you and its me
I can't believe we've been alone

Open your eyes
You've got to let her know
Stop wasting time
Make up your mind
Love her, or let her go

Talk to her, you've done something wrong
We've all got something to hide
But don't turn your back for too long
There'll always be somebody waiting in line

I could be all that she wants
Got a heart, got a home, got a hand for her to hold
Talk to her, there's something you'll find

With all this pain that you caused

And I'll be the one
Look what you lost",Talk to Her
Priestess,"That face I saw and thought of love is gone
And if you thought you'd end on top
You're wrong
You'll realize when I'm standing over you

Time will cut you down
Time will steer your path from your precious dreams
And I won't be around

No souvenirs or guilty tears
Or anything
My trust is lost and it will cost
You everything
There's a lot of lies but I'll tell you one thing that's true

Make no mistake, the hearts you break
Grow strong
I know this shame will bring you pain
So long
I know this memory will haunt you till the end",Time Will Cut You Down
Priestess,"Two kids found dead in the water
Beside each other
I don't think they drowned

Ring up the mother and father
From the gutter
They didn't want kids around

Hell no I ain't on your side
But I'm sticking around until I die

Feeling bad cause you bought her then sold her

You left a crack in the doorway

Oh, surpassing us all,
Oh, it baffles the mind,

Caue you won't get no where fooling around wit me
Messing around on your baby girl
Cause you're never talking to me (never ever)

Why is it that I can't never come over to your house
He gotta Girlfriend
And why is it that I can't never leave a message on your phone
He gotta Girlfriend

If you gotta Girlfriend

Can't conceal the way you really feel
It doesn't fit our souls exist
That of they asked me how it is

New morning dew for you
Sweet honey hips your lips
Hold spells when cast they dwell
Like magic in your kiss

Confusion colours cruel designs
Unhappy girl, you're out of time

Gentle Tuesday
Sad and lonely eyes
Gentle Tuesday
See yourself tonight

Memories as fat as bees
Presents a mess of poison tears
A word unkind that tricks our minds
We really warned before your time

Happiness, nothing less
A universal way
Bad seeds but fruit are sweet
You choke on empty days
Confusion colours cruel designs
Unhappy girl you're out of time

Voodoo rockabilly queen
'bout to kickstart your machine
Like a fighter pilot flying off to war
You had a tight black leather jacket
Skull & crossbones on the back
God bless your soul of sweet Gene Vincent
There you were

Don't want your diamonds
Don't want your gold
I want your love
I want your soul

She gave me her blessing and I gave her my curse
I drove her crazy, I drove her crazy
Sent her insane like a one-way train

In my lonely bed at night, wish that I could die
Hell's comin' down, Hell's comin' down

Made love in the morning, we got drunk at night
When she was sleepin' I stabbed her with a knife
I did deceive her, I was a midnight creeper
I robbed her blind, I drove her outta her mind

In my lonely bed at night, wish that I could die
Hell's comin' down, Hell's comin' down

Feels like the whole world's comin' down on me
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Pain in my heart, murder on my mind
I wish I was with her, I wish I could kiss her, alright

There's no sun in the sky, no love in my life
Since I lost my baby, all I do is cry
She won't come back, no, she won't come back
I broke her heart, I tore it all apart

Getting older a little bolder
I can see a new surrounding (ye)

If you're living in a palace or you got no roof
Stop complaining all the time, go now.

Come and go what to say
Make a move stop running away

Time is of the essence, try to keep track
Once it's gone(x2) it's never ever coming back
Sometimes hard to handle (ye)

Please forgive me for the times when I just did not see you
I didn't realise what I had or what I put you through
Feel it coming, ticking, chiming

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo

Swift on the steel and prepare to rip mics
It's the Prime Minister, the Minister Pete Nice
I'm soul flexin', never had the specs in
20/20 vision, bust rhymes like erections
Wrecks in sleeper, never had a beeper
Ain't going out like a 40-deuce peeper
Thumbs get picked if you say you're plumb pickin'
No prejudice, black, white, or Puerto Rican

Kick the bobo then it's plumb's that you're holding

Hard to keep it true when the others are exploiting
Never got sidetracked, the others got punched black
Many fell victim, and fell into the booty shack
Make 'em disapper like the Brooklyn Dodger

If you're on his dick, don't fret, I'm on his dick, too

Chopped by the hoes, only hoes that's good looking

Seen him in his 300 Benz with the tints
Think you want to step to the Lumberjack?
That's what you think, but you must be blunting cracks
Could you place your ass in a DJ recepticle
But a Lumberjack will just chop off your testicles
You want to get with the master chopper?
Better get a kung-fu to the little grasshopper
Heard your cuts and your cuts is kinda sloppy

Cuts stimulate, chop on the flavor hit the Ave.

Never half-step, neither semi-semi
I - I [ ] the professor, he's a swell guy
want to step to the drama over hit-and-run
Yo, you'd be out before I say Jack Robinson
Swig it, not a biggot like Archibald Bunker
Six pack of soul, there she blow, yo I sunk her
Dunk ya like a [ ] then my head got [foamy]
Took her like the Japanese took over Sony
'Lost in space' with the [ ] Dr. Smith
I got Lyor Cohen sayin (I smell a hit)
That's the record biz, yeah danger, danger
Fuck with me and Rich, and we might rearrange ya
Ain't a rapsody in blue, my crew is rollin deep
Constipated Monkeys odor hangin on 97th street
Got flavor, ill behaviour
Rich won't spin till the dough man pays ya
Hittin up hits like a symphony
The melody flows, rise to the rapsody

Stuck together like a Siamese twin
Won't get jerked, just fill it to the rim

How many beats could the Richie Rich chop
If the Daddy Rich could chop percussion?
Better call 911, get an ambulance, first aid kit for a cushion
So hop along, hop-hop-hop-hop-oh
Squeel like a pig for the mafia capo
Someone said I'm a son of a gun
But hold upM hold up, who you're callin son?
I got a drum on my side, so I swagger
Smokin boots, see a plum, yo, I bag her
High on a fly, yo, I caught a [ ] buzz
Amnesia - forgot where I was
So bring it on back for the Minister Prime Time
Like [ernest and] Julio I sip wine

(You are sleeping)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Sleep, sleep on, get your soul train
Cause I got too much ill shit on my brain
I frame a masterpiece, a visionary vibe
My words drift, many ride my joint like a stick shift
I sip booze on tours, let me see you go for yours
10 g's down, I leave ya in your fuckin drawers
Whores got hold on the industry
But I'm your pimp, that's why you're suckin me
Now it's time to uplift, true, I never gas ya
Finishin you off with the dagger while I slash ya
Wise words cut, my pocket's full of politicians
I make incisions, Daddy Rich's cut precision
I take your slumber, slide into your psyche
Slippin in a sleep like a brand-new pair of Nike
Grips if you sips on the wines you might hallucinate
Visions of you swingin from a noose, a suicide state
Of mind, seek to find, rewind the tape to peep it
Like T-La-Rock it's yours, if you sow the seeds, you reap it
I flip stlyes, keep you wild like a [ ]
[ ] penile
System, enlist em, alarm clock's ringin
Why must you sleep, why must you sleep, sleep?
Got vibes that [ ] the reaper
So make some room for the sleeper

[ VERSE 2 ]
The sleep is subtle as a switch-up mode
Sleepwalkin over, some are droppin their load
No posin pictures, break ya, then I fix ya
Rich is on the mix, Daddy Rich break mixers
I got stamina, that's why I'm havin ya
Raw on a plate, yeah, I'm cappin ya
I said [ ] watch the pelicans fly
Rippin it from Watts out to Bed-Stuy
Wilfull wishes, all hoes and bitches
You got a little tipsy and forgot about the misses
Slept and you slept and you slept on
10 feet under, now you're passed on
I caught you lunchin, yo, here's a no-dose
Eyes in the back of my head, surveillance photos
I run missions, listen to the word pass
Guess I gotta smoke you like smoke glass (Woof!)
If you want to snooze, just kick off your shoes
Get a new attitude, not a [ ]
I bring it like a hooker out roamin
I'm fierce like a pitbull foamin
I got it like HIV got so many
I'm runnin circles like [ ]
Jump off the high horse, top of the heaper
And come on down for the sleeper

I just got out last night so it's like a cycle 

Even though I know shit always don't go they way you want it to go 

I proceed to be a nigga I need, it's only real 

It's money making plans to demand at center field 

And shit's real and right now everything is tight 

I got to pack a gun but if I get caught it's my third strike 

I'm strapped up, my tennis too tight, that's how I'm living 

A nigga on a mission, anything in my way, I'm killing 

That's my mentality right, me and my niggas be quick to fight 

Type of niggas you don't want to cross if you kinda value your life 

Whether wrong or right, I got a pocket full of rocks and I'm on a block 

Smokin weed with my niggas, last thing I want to see is a cop 

On patrol, some dicksuckers roll, the heck is up 

I'm heartless so I point my middle finger cause I don't give a fuck 

I'm strapped up and on parole, I gotta fight to stay out of the penn

This life full of plenty hurt, so soft and pain 

Consequences of the game but I had to maintain 

Step on toes, I'm ready to ride or roll over 

I'm a kill for a meal, lay back and smoke some doja 

But I know what go around come around good 

Knock on wood and it's understood 

I'm stayin young at twenty one life full of regret

Stop the record just start it up you can find him in the lake 

Have your people fucked up sayin I just saw him yesterday 

See that's real and I know you motherfuckers can relate

Choose your hustle spots wisely police give you the blues 
Lock you up put a strike by your name you on paper 
See the white boy be on every money and your paper 
Put the weed down now cause we face incarceration 
Stipulations of probation strike two is what you're facin 
In the mandatory joes, now you ain't gon bounce 
Short timin round them lifers hopin that you touch down 
If I see the free world again, I'm a ball 
Put my back up on the wall hopin blessins from the lord

Nigga respect gangsta and run in the streets they walk on 
FBI might finish listenin to the car phone I talk on 
Waitin on me, wantin me to mess up, put my hands in some dirt 
But I'm a legitimate businessman, I sell light green t-shirts 
Go on officer leave me alone, I ain't be got no weapon 
I don't even know what you talkin bout, I be makin records 
Hits size I'm too busy for this bull and kicks 
Was it tinted when you pulled this six 
Over to the side of the road 
Got my hand on my heater cause I'm tired of you hoes 
Let the dog sniff my vehicle and my clothes 
But I bet I make it home cause you gotta let me go 
I'm too cold for an iron box 
I need city lights, the projects, and the boondocks

So I can put my back up against it

See it's vicious out chea on these 3rd world streets

Makin liquidate runnin in them hater streets 
So I tell my brother get the cake for me if need be

Look let me run into ya'll cause the pilots burnin over 
I've been doin the same thing since lil 
But now I'm called a soldier 
And I'm older and watch fake soldiers transform cause they own 
See them same soldiers upstate and they ain't bout no home 
Why it's already a livin hell for the average thick soldiers 
Survival of the fittest watch yourself 
Is what poppa always told me 
Why we already misled, bustin hot metals 
I just need to step back and take a look 
Cause they liquidatin the ghetto

Her dycker names are grams, pizza, and rye 
What she got ain't no need for another bitch 
But its so hard, I don't seen brothers kill brothers quick 
Mothers done lie sick, from ,meeting up with my girl 
She done make my pockets fat from Corruptin' world 
But see don't let hr high tonight 
Cause she'll make you end your life tonight

And Quarter Key is what they call her 
She's a Chi town baller, checking cheese from new orleans 
Then she ship it down to her folks uptown in Harlem 
When my chips get low, that's what my old lady for 
Can you hear me dog nigga, do you feel me dog

My world she understanding never demanding 
And never overweight, when I go to jail she post bail 
And when I'm hungry she fixes a plate she's playa hated 
By these sucker, and homie they wanted the beef 
She kept my homies paid I know they like her 
Because they nicknamed her ""D"" 
 
My old lady snow jumped off the poacher 
Native four expensive hoe she balls cutthroat 
With gangstas cross if you here to one time 
Ain't no flossing, but if you pimp the bitch and stack the grits 
She make em good money they hoe hype stand on the block all day 
Long police mad, can't stand my bitch game plan 
Slick with her should I love money making bitch 
She got that fire, got all that junk and boy 6

You niggas want to love, my old lady tattoo slug bouncin' 
That ass in the club my old lady got the tweakers ,tweakers 
And she love when I beat her with that b-12, and watch it swell 
Making my paper on the streets, ugh and since I 
Pimp her so sweeter it comes back to me 
A boss bitch, every nigga want to please 
But they better get the fuck from around me, soul survivors, up in it 
Pimp that hoe for me from that LAP, to the LBC now pimp that hoe for me

Moonlight spills on comic books
And superstars in magazines
An old friend calls and tells us where to meet
Her plane takes off from Baltimore
And touches down on Bourbon Street

We sit outside and argue all night long
About a god we've never seen
But never fails to side with me
Sunday comes and all the papers say
Ma Teresa's joined the mob
And happy with her full time job

Do do do do do do

Am I alive or thoughts that drift away?
Does summer come for everyone?
Can humans do as prophets say?
And if I die before I learn to speak
Can money pay for all the days I lived awake
But half asleep?

Do do do do do do

A life is time, they teach us growing up
The seconds ticking killed us all
A million years before the fall
You ride the waves and don't ask where they go
You swim like lions through the crest
And bathe yourself on zebra flesh

May have nestled its way into his mighty throat

The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the
Oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days

Many a head snapped for double--even triple--takes as this vivacious
Feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most
Virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out

They hung in droves
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place
And that was O'Malley's Alley

But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into
The heart of the alleyway

She was looking for that he cat

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear 
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again
But sometimes, sometimes life ain't always the way

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
He used to say so strong, oh unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine

""Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song"" she said

How can I make you see that it's cool? 
Can't you just trust me?

Listen, for you naked I would dance a ballet 
Would that get you off? 
Tell me what will 
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me? 

Would you let me see you naked then? 
Would you let me give you a bath? 
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh 

And would you, would you let me kiss you there 
You know, down there where it counts 
I'll do it so good, I swear I'll drink every ounce 
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long

You can hardly be aware

And from chilblains on my feet
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk
Pray let us take the air
Said the table to the chair (can't nobody)

Said the chair to the table
Now you know we are not able (fuck with us)
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk (can't nobody)
Said the table with a sigh 
It can do no harm to try (fuck with us)
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two (say, can't nobody) 

So they both went slowly down (fuck with us)
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound (can't nobody)
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side (fuck with us)
See the table and the chair 
Have come to take the air (y'all, say it y'all)

But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
Till, to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house.

When they whispered to each other
Oh delightful little brother (can't nobody fuck with us)
What a lovely walk we've taken
Let us dine on beans and bacon
So the ducky and the little browny (say it, y'all)

And danced upon the heads

'Cause there's the key to unlock the body
Place it like that to open up the door

And he jacks the box 'til the party rocks

Things didn't turn out quite like I wanted them to
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode

Everybody want to see you down for the count
But that ain't what being a real man's about
The brave and the bold hang around for the kill
So the bigger the hole, the bigger we fill it (fill it!)
They can hit us with all they got
But cha know what?

That's like trying to tell Columbus that the world is flat.
If the song we're singing truly is the best
Then that my brothers is the ultimate test
All in favor say hey
We can change anything at all.

Prince,"He like to frequent this club down up on 36th
Pimps and things like to hang outside and cuss for kicks

Talking to no one in particular, they say ""the baddest I am tonight""
Four letter words are seldom heard with such dignity and bite.
All the poets and the part time singers always hang inside
Live music from a band plays a song called ""Soul Psychodelicide"".
The song's a year long and had been playing for months when he
Walked into the place.
No one seemed to care, an introverted this-is-it look on most of their faces.
Up on the mic repeating two words, over and over again
Was this woman he had never noticed before he lost himself in the
Articulated manner in which she said them.
These two words, a little bit behind the beat.
I mean just enough o-turn you on.
For every time she said the words another one of his doubts were gone.

Should he try to rap with her? Should he stand and stare?
No one else was watching her, she didn't seem to care.
So over and over, she said the words til he could take no more, (no more)
He dragged her from the stage and together they ran through the back door
In the alley over by the curb he said tell me what's your name
She only said the words again and it started to rain (rain, rain, rain)
Two words falling between the drops and the moans of his condition
Holding someone is truly believing there's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition. [Repeat: x4]
She said love me, love me, what she say?
She say love me, love me.
Joy, why don't you love me baby, joy, why can't you love me baby
Joy, come on and love me baby, joy in repetition
Alright, joy in repetition, [Repeat: x3]
Alright, joy, all my wishes add up to one
Love me, joy, Love me, joy, Love me, joy
Love me, Love me, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Joy, joy in repetition,
Joy, joy (love me) in repetition,
Love me, love, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Joy, and I'm gonna say it again, joy, joy, and I'm gonna say it again,
Joy, I'd like to go way up high and say, Love me, joy

We are gathered here today 
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The after world

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby 

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited 
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down

Thirty thousand feet and still-a-counting (live for love)

They killed my buddy but I'm supposed to feel nothing (live for love)

How can I live for love?
I'm calling (Live for love)

Live for love, without love you don't live
And how you make it is based on what you're givin' back
In fact, only a few of us slip through the cracks
Through generations
The cards have always been stacked against us (live for love)
To love each other is a must
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Believe me, unity is a must
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
I'm kickin' reality in the streets of the city
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
And 'gangking' any clown who ain't down
With the colors that you're sportin' 'round
Listen G, you are supposed to be
Strivin' to be the best that you can be
So stop tryin' to dominate and push and shove (live for love)
Come on y'all
We got to live for love (live for love)

Prince,"I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come to funk around
'Til I get your daughter I won't leave this town

In the beginning God made the sea
But on the 7th day he made me
He was tryin' to rest y'all
When He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar, cold gettin' down

I tried to bust a high note
But I bust a string
My God was worried
'Til he heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
Hurt me

Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody

Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk I am a junky
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got two sides and they're both friends

Don't try to clock 'em, they're much too fast
If you try to stop 'em they kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When you hear my music you'll be havin' fun

That's when I gottcha
That's when you mine
To tell the truth
Tell me what's my line?

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
Hurt me

Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody

My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
'Cause I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul

I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came today?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than you
But if you want to play with me, you better learn the rules

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come to funk around
'Til I get your daughter I won't leave this town

I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this, leave this, leave this

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
Funky fresh for the 90's

Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, some

The funkier I be, the funkier I get, oh shit
Lickety split on the lyric, a new jack in the pulpit
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this you're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak

When you jumped on my D I see K
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was too big for you anyway
You're just a simpleton, I'll bust you like a pimple, son
My star is too bright
Boy, I'll sink you like the ship, Poseidon Adventure

You're bumpin' dentures to be cocksure
There must be more coming from your mouth than manure
So with a flow and a spray, I say
""Hey, you must become a prince before you're king anyway""

Do that, do that somebody
Do that, do that somebody

It's time to get ig-ig-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on, you've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin' in my cauldron

That means my nugget, sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin', the other brothers buggin'
And this is for those who oppose
To propose to overexpose disclose
Pose a threat to my brother

Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let you play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do you expect to win when you're used to playing craps?

Do that, do that somebody
Do that, do that somebody

It's gettin' tricky, I mean it's a sticky situation
To resurrect a groove with feeling and give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows what lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow

12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air
This is a motherfucking party

While you're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack
Give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
To layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome
And I'm out

To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The after world

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

Change stone to bread with the touch of his hand
Made the blind see and the dumb understand

He died for the tears in your eyes
Your eyes

Many people came from all around
Hear this man preach, glorious sound
Spoke of man in harmony and love abound

He died for the tears in your eyes
Your eyes

Your eyes
Your, eyes

Died for the tears in your eyes
For the tears in your eyes
And the tears of sorrow
For cents may be all that they're worth
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth
The earth

Faith is a word, we all should try
Describing the man who willingly died
Believe that your hunger, sorrow, and fears 

Is less than the tears in your eyes
Your eyes

Less than the tears in your eyes
For the tears in your eyes
And the tears of sorrow
For cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth

Say it again
For the tears in your eyes
And the tears of sorrow
For cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth
The earth

Thank you",4 the Tears in Your Eyes [Live]
