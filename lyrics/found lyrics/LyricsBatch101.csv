Etta Jones,"There goes my heart, there goes the one I love,
There goes the girl i was unworthy of.
There goes my happiness, it couldn't be,
There goes somebody else in place of me.

Goodbye romance, it couldn't last somehow,
I had my chance, but it's all over now.
I never thought that she could pass me by,
There goes my heart, and here am I!

I never thought that she could pass me by,
There goes my heart, and here am I!",There Goes My Heart
Etta Jones,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

W e may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me
Can't take that away
Can't take that away from me",They Can't Take That Away from Me
Etta Jones,"We meet and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard
You speak and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word?

Suddenly the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore

Then suddenly I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart

Suddenly the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore

Then suddenly I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart

",And the Angels Sing
Etta Jones,"Answer me, oh, my love
Just what sin have I been guilty of
Tell me how I came to lose your love
Please answer me, my love

You were mine yesterday
I believed that love was here to stay
Won't you tell me where I've gone astray
Please answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me, my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me, my love

",Answer Me My Love
Etta Jones,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife'
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off of my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed
Give me the simple life

I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife'
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off of my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed
Give me, oh, give me, oh, give me the simple life

",Give Me the Simple Life
Etta Jones,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)
Etta Jones,"Looking back over my life
I can see where I caused you strife
But I know, oh yes, I know
I'd never make that same mistake again

Looking back over my deeds
I can see signs a wise man heeds
And if I just had the chance
I'd never make that same mistake again

Once my cup was overflowing
But I gave nothing in return
Now I can't begin to tell you
What a lesson I have learned

Looking back over the slate
I can see love turned to hate
But I know, oh yes, I know
I'd never make that same mistake again

Once my cup was overflowing
But I gave nothing in return
Now I can't begin to tell you
Oh, what a lesson I have learned

Looking back over the slate
I can see love turned to hate
But I know, oh yes, I know
I'd never make that same mistake again

",Looking Back
Etta Jones,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay
Etta Jones,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You
Etta Jones,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me [*]

Gee, baby ain't I good to you 
There's nothing in the world 
Too good for a girl that's good and true

Etta Jones,"I used to love to hold you when the lights were down low
But it's all over now
You used to whisper little things to set me aglow
But it's all over now

I listened to you tell me little white lies
Never thought you meant to deceive
Whoever would have doubted those innocent eyes
And all the little kisses that you made me believe

Remember how I planned a little home by a stream
Where we?d spend every day
You must have thought me crazy when I painted that dream
'Cause you threw it away

I kinda wish that things would be different
Have a happy ending somehow
But I guess you only took me for a ride in the dark
And it's all over now

Etta Jones,"The song that you sang so sweetly
You called it our love refrain
It's gone and I'm left completely
Out in the cold again

I dreamed that our love would linger
But just memories remain
As I gaze at that ring-less finger
Out in the cold again

True, it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new
But deep down inside my whole world depended on you

I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain
But now I'm back where you found me
Out in the cold again

Etta Jones,"I'm trav'lin' light because my man has gone,
So from now on I'm trav'lin' light.
He said goodbye and took my heart away,
So from today I'm trav'lin' light.

No-one to see,
I'm free as the breeze,
No-one but me
And my memories.
Some lucky night he may come back again,
So until then I'm trav'lin' light.

Etta Jones,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",The Way We Were
Etta Jones,"
Way down at Mister Joe's Cafe
They're takin' someone far away,
And if you hear a song today.
It's a sad tune that you'll be playin':
 
She's leavin' and folks are feelin' so low,
They're grievin' and they're consolin' poor Joe;
Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile
She'll be travlin' alone down that last long mile
They're sighin'
With all their trouble and woes
They're cryin' 'cause they all loved 
The Gal From Joe's
 
She's leavin' and folks are feelin' so low,

Etta Jones,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow i'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Etta Jones,"If I loved you
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know

If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go

Longin' to tell you but afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I loved you if I loved you

If I loved you
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know

If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way

Etta Jones,"You sigh, the song begins, you speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies and rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic

Without a golden wand or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand the world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows when there is no rain?
It's magic

Why do I tell myself these things that happen are all really true
When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you?

When we walk hand in hand the world becomes a wonderland

Etta Jones,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

Etta Jones,"Everyone knows him as old folks
Like the seasons he comes and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And his own corn cob pipe is so mellow, hits right
But you needn't be ashamed of him

In the evenings after supper
What stories he tells
How he held his speech at Gettysburg for Lincoln that day
You know I know that one so well

One thing we don't know about old folks
Did he fight for the blue or the gray?
But he's so democratic and so diplomatic
We always let him have his way

In the evenings after supper
What stories he tells
How he held his speech at Gettysburg for Lincoln that day
Yes, I know that one so well

Some day there will be no more old folks
What a lonely old world this will be
Children's voices at play will be still fonding
The day they take old folks away",Old Folks
Etta Jones,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love

And I'll know her the moment we meet

No more his eager call,

The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.

Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,

For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Etta Jones,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

Etta Jones,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Bleongs to Somebody Else)
Etta Jones,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Her only answer is one little smile,

Something we don't know what

And it's wrong

Wrong because I can't believe
He's come home to love only me
Oh, yes

Be gone again and again
And again and again
And again

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it

Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true

Like reflections of my subconscious.
Beyond the starlit heaven the horizon burns
With flames, so red.
As my eyes bear witness to this euphoria,
This apocalypse,
I hear the gates within my head open silently.
A new world takes form and its attraction
Temps me to enter.
I leave my body without farewells,
Peacefully
Through violet corridors,
Painted with beautiful
Reflections, from my life.
A sunrise beckons beyond the clouds, so dark,
As rivers stream through the air in stillness.
Through the emptiness where
Thoughts take form,
And into the lands of purgatory.",Fallen

Que no mata una mosca
Sé que algo más muy feo
Lo veo

Eres egoísta y piensas solo en ti
Y en vez de cariño prefieres perseguir dinero lo veo
Vieja traicionera, de mí te vas a acordar
Todo lo que has hecho ya lo tendrás que pagar

Lo que andas diciendo a mí no me va a lastimar
Porque a fin de cuentas siempre sale la verdad

Mentirosa, ya no te creo

Mentirosa, de tu veneno

Te puede alucinar, ese brillo que tiene al mirar
Ten cuidado que te va a hacer mal
Si tú caes en las redes letales de la mentirosa

Caras vemos corazónes no
Que sus besos saben a traición
Te lo digo yo anduve enredado con la mentirosa

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Like the kicker in a julep or two

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me

Don't look so vain with me

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon

Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love

But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

He'll know just what to do.

Then you're in for a big surprise

I'd stand by jour side to rule and fight

In an open car
To tempt you in
And drive you far away

And I want you
And I want you so

Love is a danger
Of a different kind
To take you away
And leave you far behind
And love love love
Is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it
And you still can't
Get enough of the stuff

It's savage and it's cruel
And it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood
And it seems like religion
It's noble and it's brutal
It distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up
And you're left like a zombie

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

It's guilt edged
Glamorous and sleek by design
You know it's jealous by nature
False and unkind
It's hard and restrained
And it's totally cool
It touches and it teases
As you stumble in the debris

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so

Like skeletons of leaves on the wall

Shades of sleep have driven you away.

The moon is pale outside
And you are far from here.

Breathing shifts your careless head
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives.

Another day, another night
Has taken you again my dear.

And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there
When you need someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes

Wait till tomorrow comes, yea yea
Wait till tomorrow comes, yea yea

Last night while you were
Lying in my arms
And I was wondering where you were
You know you looked just like a baby
Fast asleep in this dangerous world.

Every star was shining brightly
Just like a million years before.

And we were feeling very small
Underneath the universe.

And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there when you need
Someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes",When Tomorrow Comes [Extended Version][*]
Eurythmics,"Well there's a color picture
In my mind.
Of all the places
That I've left behind.
The broken windows
Where the wind blows through
Empty shells of houses
That have turned to ruin.

Oh, we were so young.
We didn't realise
Just what we'd done.
Oh, we were too young.

[Chorus:]
And I remember you.
You were the back yard boy.
Hiding in the wreckage
Of broken dreams.
Standing by the railway line.
Standing.

Oh, we were so young.
We didn't realise
Just what we'd done.
Oh, we were too young.

And all the sweetness
Has been taken out of this place.
So many memories
Are knocked down or replaced.
And I can't stand to see
The shifting time
Taking me further,
Leaving you behind.

[Chorus]",I Remember You
Eurythmics,"I could be anywhere else but here
But the rain won't let me go.
There's a photograph
Hanging on my wall
Of a place I've never been to

And I can't stop the rain
(Feels like Sunday everyday)
What do the papers say?
(Feels like Sunday everyday)
Get up and go now!

[Chorus:]
In this town, something's gotta change.
In this town, something's gotta change.

I'm looking at the world,
Looking for a scene,
Waiting for a day,
Filling in time like I'm digging
My own grave

I'll never make the grade

Eurythmics,"Well the first time that I saw you
You were standing in the rain.
You were waiting at the station
For the last connecting train.
Well, who will you go to
When there's no-one to betray?
And I said, who will you go to
When your best friend turns away?
Hey hey

Last time you're gonna let me down.
Last time you're gonna
Fool around with me

There's a garden full of roses,
There's a necklace full of pearls.
You have come to take the roses
To give to other girls.
Well, I am just a pretty thing
You wanted for a day.
There is nothing left between us
There is nothing left to say,
Hey hey

People like you
Can be so mean.
People like you
Just don't come clean.",The Last Time
Eurythmics,"He was the kinda guy
I liked the way he looked.
He had a red silk tie
He had a forties suit.
And I said, ""You're the kind of person
I've been longing to adore.""
""You're the kind of person
I've been waiting for.""
He said, ""The time is right to take a chance
'Cause I'm looking for a brand new romance.""
""So come on baby let's go outside,
I've got a car in the drive and we can take a ride.""

""So let's go, I wanna fall in love ooh hoo.""
""Let's go, I wanna fall in love ooh hoo.""

Well, we went driving for an hour or so
Till we took the little Chevy down to Mexico.
And I said, ""Blue eyed boy, you know I love the way you look.""
""Why don't we find a preacher
Who can get us hooked?""
""You know the time is right to take a chance
'Cause I'm looking for a brand new romance.""
And the great big moon
Was a shinin' down

You know you'll only hurt yourself.

In a world of illusion
That's covering your mind?

When you open your mind
You'll discover the sign
That there's something
You're longing to find

The miracle of love
Will take away your pain
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again.

Cruel is the night
That covers up your fears.
Tender is the one
That wipes away your tears.
There must be a bitter breeze
To make you sting so viciously
They say the greatest coward
Can hurt the most ferociously.
But I'll show you something good.
Oh I'll show you something good.

You can make a start
When your crumbling world falls apart.

When the miracle of love
Comes your way again.",The Miracle of Love

And take your pain away.

Take your pain away
Take your pain away

And even though you're far from here
Don't forget I'm always near.
Find comfort in these words I send
In this cold world.

For every broken soul

You do it very well
You do it so politely
That you couldn't even tell

When everything has changed
You think you're not to blame
How come you keep on talking
When the whole thing feels so strange?

But seeing
Is not the same as believing
When everything goes wrong
You're anything but strong

It's all bittersweet
Outside in the street
The grass is growing greener
Underneath your feet

We come and go
Deep water flows
Tiny leaves from small seeds
To tall trees do grow

But wanting
Is not the same thing as needing
There's no need to pretend
You can't turn back again

And loving
Is so different to keeping
The hurting that we send
Is so difficult to mend

Hold on to the good things
That keep you from falling down
Hold on to the good things
That keep you from falling down

How my heart aches
More than I can take
What are we really learning
When we make the same mistakes?

Where is your hope?
It's all gone up in smoke
You used to be so funny
Now it's just the same old joke

And laughing
Is so very close to crying
When there's nothing to defend
It gets you in the end

And living
Is so very close to dying

To find where you belong
Where do you belong?

Eurythmics,"My true love is sitting on a pile of stones
And he's wondering to himself
Oh, where did I go wrong?

My true love has found himself alone
And he's sorry for it all
And for the hurt, we've done

And I've given more than I can take
Fallen for the same mistake
Promises were made to break
What will save us now?

And I don't want to remember
And I don't want to remember

My true love is a saccharine kind of pill
That tastes too sweet for words
And cannot be fulfilled

My true love is a dangerous China cup
With all the broken pieces
That cannot be picked up

Now all the colors left to run
All the dreams have been undone
Love has left me standing here
Raging at the sun

Eva,"Qui dove il mare luccica e tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto, tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e
La bianca scia di un’elica

Sentì il dolore nella musica, si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte

Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all’improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai

Potenza della lirica dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po’ di trucco e
Con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano, così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole, confondono I pensieri

Così diventa tutto piccolo, anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come la scia di un’elica

Ma sì, è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaje ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai
Te voglio bene assaje ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai",Caruso

It ain't over - so don't act like you're dyin'
If they told you it was easy they're lyin'
Only you can get up when you're down
Stop running 'cause you know you're gonna run into somethin'
Dust it off and act like it was nothin'
And get ready for the next round

So many dreams locked in a box tryin' to break free
Seems like I won't live 'til they breathe
My feet are dragging
Torn to rags feels like I'm begging
These chains are slowly killing me

It doesn't matter where I hide
I always end up lookin' inside
Listening while my heart lectures me
Sayin' you're so close to victory

These sirens are starting to scream
And I admit you've got me underneath your spell
Intoxicated by your mystery
A junkie 'cause you keep me thirsty
Sayin' you're so close to victory

So stop cryin'
Stop cryin'
Stop cryin'
Stop cryin'
Stop cryin'
Ooh dust it off and act like it was nothin'
Stop cryin'
Move on
Stop cryin'
Move on",Stop Cryin'
Eva Avila,"Woke up to find myself
Standing in another day
Filled with anxiety, and praying for a different way
I give it all I have, till I have no more to give
I used to think I'd die for love
Now I'd rather live
If everywhere you look you'd find some misery
The view from there can make you feel
Just a little crazy

[Chorus:]
This kind of love ain't right
Won't take us through the night
Some think love equals pain but
This kind of love's not true
Not good for me or you
I think we got to get out of this rain

Sleep walking through life
Waiting for the other shoe to fall
Dreams cut like a knife
When you think you shouldn't dream at all
I saw a dark cloud
Looks like it follows us around
And it doesn't take that much you know
To make it tumble down
How did we ever go from being so happy
To suffer along and be strong
Just so we can keep on keepin' on

If everywhere you look you'll find some misery
The view from there can make you feel
Just a little crazy",This Kind of Love
Eva Avila,"Feels like I'm back in fifth grade
Day dreaming 'bout when you ask me to come and play
But you never do, you sit so far away
You don't even notice the heart I drew around your name,
I know it's crazy, I feel like a fool
'Cause every time you walk into the room, I always miss my cue

[Chorus]
I want to know if someone turns you on at night
I want to know if it could be me
I got to know how to make you see
That you've got me weak in the knees

Feels like I never learned to speak
Every time I think to ask how was your week-end
So I never do, I just hope to be seen
But I casually cross your path
While tripping over my feet
I know it's crazy, I ain't gonna lie
But every time that you give me a sign
I always miss my line

Oh you don't even know it
No...
There's a table for two
For me and you
Though it's so hard to show it
Oh...
When I give you no clue

Every day after day,
I been thinking of what I could say
To get through to you
Wish I could read your mind
So that I could find
If you're feelin' me too

I want to know if... oh baby
I want to know if... ooh oh
You got me
You got me",Weak in the Knees

Above earth's lamentations,
I hear the real, though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation.

Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear it's music ringing,
It sounds an echo in my soul.
How can I keep from singing?

While though the tempest loudly roars,
I hear the truth, it liveth.
And though the darkness 'round me close,
Songs in the night it giveth.

No storm can shake my inmost calm,
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble sick with fear
And hear their death knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing?

No storm can shake my inmost calm,
While to that rock I'm clinging.

I see the city through the rain
I'm just chasing me in my time
And remembering some pain

You see there once was a boy
And on the street he'd surely die
So the night bird took him in
And she taught him how to fly

See the night bird softly fly
Why does she fly alone
Is the moonlight just a flame
For her memory now she's gone

To big bars and honky tonks
Any pleasure can be found
You can get just what you want
If you lay your money down

And lonely sailors do their drinking
My my my how the brave men do die
And the night bird sells her pleasures
Bringing tears to my eyes

See the night bird softly fly
Why does she fly alone
Is the moonlight just a flame
For her memory now she's gone

So I guess I'll go out walking
Lord let the rain keep falling down
I guess I'll go and chase some memories
In the dark side of town

From a heart filled with pain

Are put back together again

Well I wanted to hurt you
For the tears you made you made me cry
All my hopes and dreams
Well they started vanishing
Those tender hurt feelings
Became a dangerous thing

Eva Cassidy,"Tall trees in Georgia they grow so high they shade me so
And sadly walking through the thicket I go

The sweetest love I ever had I left aside
Because I did not want to be any man's bride

But now I'm older and married I would be
I found my sweetheart but he would not marry me

When I was younger the boys all came around
But now I'm older and they've all settled down

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Oh, way above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Daddy left this gas & convenience store just before he died 
And I was only nineteen when I had my third baby 
And sometimes I think maybe I should've left here long ago

You're calling to me, I can't hear what you have said
And you say, ""go slow, I've fallen behind""

If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting,
Time after time

Watching through windows, I'm wondering if you're ok

Eva Cassidy,"Let me tell you 'bout a boy I know
He's my baby and he lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
He brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know yes I know
Hallelujah I just love him so

When I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him (knock knock knock) on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
And there is nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
And whispers baby everything is alright

Don't be discouraged
Though I realize
It's hard to take courage

Eva Cassidy,"The water is wide I can not get o'er
And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that will carry two
And both shall row my love and I
O love is handsome and love is fine
And love's a jewel when it's first new
But love grows old then waxes gold
And fades away like morning dew
There is a ship it's sailing the sea
It's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim
The water is wide I can not get o'er
And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that will carry two
And both shall row my love and I

True romance has died

[Chorus]

Then I think of all the lonely people
All thinking about
Why they're the ones that live without
Then I see a smile on her face

And I wonder how long will it stay
True romance has died

[Chorus]",And Then She Says
Evan & Jaron,"Was he a painter
Underground major
Wasn't he conspiring with Ralph Nader
Sunday afternoons in central park
Was he a writer
A freedom fighter
Did he make your world a little brighter
Mondays after dark
Andy Warhol had to die
We don't know why
We don't know why
Now he's painting passersby
In his corner of the sky
Was he a thinker
A heavy drinker
Was Nixon wrapped around his finger
I've heard crazy Alli swear he was
Was he a controller
A hip rock n' roller
Did he realize that the war was over
Or let them go on just because
(Chorus)
While Lou's still walking on the wild side
(Chorus)
Now I've been working
Nights at the diner
Where a soup can serves as my reminder
Did he ever draw JFK
Has anyone seen him
Talked to him lately
Would you tell him that I'm waiting
Sunday afternoons in central park",Andy Warhol (3:59 of Fame)
Evan & Jaron,"Looking over the edge
I can almost see you smile
But I can't be too sure
Looking to the light
I can almost hear you call
But I can't be too sure
Please don't leave me here alone
It's getting dark
Please take me home
What else can I say
To make you look my way
I've tried to do the things you've said
It's not working
Is it all in my head
I want to close my eyes
And count to ten
And when I open them
I want to be somewhere else
I just don't see the things
Other people seem to see
Reaching out to touch you
A name without a face
But I don't really understand
I ask to you these questions
For you I do recall
After it all
Please don't leave me here alone
It's getting dark
Please take me home
I've tried to do the things you've said
It's not working
Is it all in my head
(Chorus)",Close My Eyes
Evan & Jaron,"Another cold day
Three weeks in a row
I spend more time getting dressed than
Where it is I go
There are people on the streets
Shaking out their hands
Some to say hello others
Stay as warm as they can
I'm stopping in
For a hot cup of coffee
With an old bum who says
He could've been James Dean
Now the chief of police
Has asked him to leave
I say no, no, no
This man's with me
He makes me laugh
He makes me smile
And sometimes I cry
And he wrecks my mind
With a simple smile
Sometimes I believe in God for a while
Now I give a nod to Lucy
She knows my name
I've been around a lot here lately
Wow...someone knows my name
There's Dylan on the jukebox
A song from highway 61
James says he knows Dylan
That he wrote this one

(Chorus)
James has got a real name
But he prefers James
It reminds him of his youth
When he had a body just like yours
He says no one ever gives a damn
Unless they've got something to sell
It's a long way back
When you've fallen through hell
I'm stopping in
For a hot cup of coffee
With an old bum who says
He could've been James Dean
The chief of police
Has asked him to leave
And he whispers to me
As he tugs on my sleeve
You make me laugh
You make me smile
And sometimes I cry
But you never wrecked my mind
With a simple smile
Sometimes I believe in God for a while",Could've Been James Dean
Evan & Jaron,"I wonder how the morning came
Last night I went insane
I threw some things
I smashed some things
What happens next
I haven't figured out yet
I'm not quite sure what
Drove me to the madness
Bringing on my dark side
Was it me
Was it you and your obnoxious friends
That made me feel defenseless
I couldn't care less about
The things you'll think when I walk out
I couldn't care less about
What happens now
I couldn't care less about
The psycho-babble from your mouth
I don't think I care enough to care
Tripped on your diploma
Bulldozing through
Bringing spring into the room
Somewhere on a country road
You're probably killing me
Under broken things
You found your wings
Goodbye

(Chorus)
By now you've reached the mountains
Denied yourself the fountains
Off exit 41
In the old blue cabin
That hides the sun so well

(Chorus)",Couldn't Care Less About
Evan & Jaron,"Seems the morning has got you down
A gray window in a small town
Don't you worry darling
Don't you worry about it darling
This is how I keep the sky from falling
So hold on to me
I will try to keep the sky
From falling down on you
The ghost stories behind your eyes
Are something I can sympathize with
So don't you worry about it darling
'Cause I ain't worried about it darling
This is how I keep the sky from falling",How to Keep the Sky From Falling
Evan & Jaron,"Could you speak a little louder
Cause I thought I heard you say
That you need me and you're coming back to stay

I guess it's harder
To say whats on your mind
When you haven't told the truth at any time
And now its time to divide
You take what's yours and I'll take mine

[Chorus]
Is it all that great without me
I really wanna know
Was it easy to forget me
Cause your eyes are saying No
Did you find a broken rainbow
With an empty pot of gold
And if its all that great without me
Than I'm glad you let me go

I don't mean to sound so vengeful
Or to hit you when your down
But you took my house of dreams
And burnt it to the ground

And now you say your're really sorry
Well that's really nice to hear
But where were you when
Everything we had got up and disappeared
And now its time to let go
Walk through that door way and let it close

[Chorus]

When you walk into the sun
And turn your back on everyone
Will the world keep spinning
Round and round and watch what you had is gone

[Chorus: x2]",Is It All That Great Without Me
Evan & Jaron,"You never smile
The way you used to do
I see you trying
But it's just not you
What is wrong
And what is right
Marvin said he tried
He just couldn't get through
Maybe it's a line
He's just not used to
What went wrong
And what went right
Tell me do you plan this pain
Does it come down on you
Like the rain
Is there something I can say to you
I can't stop the storm
But I can cover you
There's something in the doorway
Between you and me
From my angle
It's too hard to see
Tell me would you please
Humor me
Do you care about me
Then care about yourself
Or carry on your way
All by yourself
Your sinking ship
Is drowning me

(Chorus)
Every now and then
I think of how it used to be
The power you would send
Would light up the city
For miles around you were never alone
I can see you struggle
And I can feel your pain
I think we're headed for trouble
Are we falling apart again

(Chorus)",Like the Rain
Evan & Jaron,"Guess who came by
And asked about you last night
Asked if you were seeing someone else
It's no big thing

So how have you been doing
I'm kind of seeing someone new myself
Are you listening close enough to hear
Somewhere it changed

I'm falling back in
Now it's me who's calling you again
I hear myself go on and on
Hoping I'll accidentally make sense

Don't ask me now
What's on my mind
Maybe I just called to say hi
But I guess you can see

[Chorus]
There are two things that I need
Nothing and everything
Do you still have
Those shoes I used to laugh at

Remember that night they turned your feet red
Is it too much
To tell you that I think of
The sound of those shoes falling by my bed

If you could read my mind
You'd see it clear

[Chorus]

Hey I didn't mean
To take up your time
I know this sounds like a riddle
I'm hiding behind
But there's nothing I want more
Than to have everything
Like it used to be

[Chorus]",Nothing and Everything
Evan & Jaron,"I never shared I never cared
It didn't matter much
And no one stared
I didn't pretend to be someone
To be somewhere
You know that's not my style
So put my picture on your button
My name around your hat
Call all the neighbors
And tell them I'm back
I've changed
I've come in from the ledge
I've changed
There's nothing here at all
No nothing here at all
For me to run from
I'd like to show you sometime
What I'm all about
I am pushing myself through
And hanging on
Without love it's lonely
Where I stand
Are you lonely too
It's a long, long road home
But I'll run, I'll run for you
You're everyone's everything
I'm dust in a Saturn ring
I champion the things you hate
The list is long
An hour late
I've changed
I've come in from the ledge

There's nothing here at all
No nothing here at all

Evan & Jaron,"I stare alone
For no reason at all
I could've had someone with me
But didn't think to call
And I'm definitely bored
And I sit with the cure
I know I want to go
Yet my mind must know something more
I want to go home
Somewhere south of Tennessee
I want to go home
This isn't what it used to be
Feel the lines
They're on my face
Where old school yards
Aren't parking space
I'm home
I'm home
South of Tennessee
Now I'm stuck in time
In an ordinary chair
This ain't no dream land
Hell this is nowhere
I'd ever wish to be
And I haven't spoken to my brother in over 2 years
And I smell like cigarettes
And I don't and won't even smoke the stuff
But it seems to be growing on me

(Chorus)
Now I touch my face
Everythings feels to be in place
I have no clue how long it's been since I left you
And left myself in outer space
You know gravity's cool for a while
But so are go-carts
And I know I want to go
But don't want to deal with the technical parts

But let me tell it to you anyway 
Although I never mean to let you down 
You keep your head up and you stand your ground 
Don't think I don't see all the things that you do 
You're the reason we've made it through 
There you are 
On the phone again 
Reminding me why we're still friends 
There's a road we're on that never ends 
Cause there you are again 
I know that sometimes I don't think to call 
But don't start thinking I don't care at all 
I'm always on my way to somewhere else 
Searching high and low to find myself 
Stuck on that highway 
Between here and there 
I could be anywhere

You're like the eye of a hurricane 
You are a constant in a world of change 
You are the calm in the storm 
When life gets strange

Talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by

But she don't know how I feel

But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl

She was the one to hold me
The night the sky fell down
And what was I thinking then
The world didn't end
Why didn't I know what I know now?

Would you look at her? She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she'll figure out I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl

Right now, face to face
All my fears, pushed aside
And right now, I'm ready to spend
The rest of my life with you

Would you look at her? She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl

Evan & Jaron,"Do I miss you, not that much
I stopped doing that a couple of months ago
And I was feeling so much better
I'm not sure now why you called
I didn't think we'd speak this soon, if at all again
Since you left me in a letter

Now I hear your voice
And it goes on and on, on and on

You may have questions now
But I believe that you were wrong
All that I wanted was you
You never questioned then
That leaving me would be the end
All that I wanted was you

I used to think we had some room to run
But that was long before you ran away with someone else
Like my feelings didn't matter
Now I'm stuck, as if you couldn't tell
Between what I want and a past I know too well
And I'm inclined to choose the latter

You can't even tell me why
Without walking in a lie
What do you want me to do?
Give it all another try?
Cross your fingers â??til you die
I've already played the fool for you",All That I Wanted
Evan & Jaron,"You really should have told me by now
'Cause if what I've heard is true
You were falling from me, while I was falling for you
Well I wish you would have told me by now
'Cause I didn't mean to waste your time
And I hardly considered you, a waste of mine

I'm just another mistake that you're not gonna make
I'm just one less day for you to throw away
And when you tell your friends about how it ended
Please be kind 'cause you know that I tried
'Cause you know I tried

Now I'm thinking back and looking for clues
For the day you changed your mind
Was I moving way too fast to see the signs
I'm replaying every word you said
Every laugh and every sigh
You had a thousand secret ways to say good-bye.

I tried to give you more, but you wanted less
I tried to read your mind but I failed the test
Why don't you try for once and get it off your chest",Another Mistake
Evan & Jaron,"You call me to tell me you're sorry
That you're moving away with the day
Well I'll be alright without you
You weren't that good to me anyway

You promise that it's not about me
That I gave you everything
And you don't want to live without me
But you don't want to tangle me in your kite strings

Fly away if you want to
I would never try to hold you down
You can fly away if you want to
Just don't crash on me when you hit the ground

Don't pretend that you're crying
When you're halfway to somebody else
I don't need to know all the details
You can keep them to yourself

You can come around if you want to, I don't care
Your pretty eyes won't save you
Not like they used to, I'm looking through you",Fly Away
Evan & Jaron,"If nature sold herself on layaway with a little down
I would be the first in line to buy myself a sound
A waterfall, a tidal wave or a beating of the drums
A heavy wind, a thunder or a falling of the leaves

And I would proclaim, I'm the new proprietor of a sound
In a press conference held downtown when the people would look at me
In this state I would simply tell them this
At least you'll have someone to blame for ruining your weekend

I would play Mother Nature unease my sound at will
No more sitting and waiting on this quite window sill
If I feel like love I will shake the trees
If I'm consumed in loneliness then I will drop the leaves

And I would proclaim, I'm the new proprietor of a sound
In a press conference held downtown when the people would look at me
In this state I would simply say outright
At least you have someone to blame for scaring the children in the night

What if I call for a waterfall some light rain
And some other owner calls for a massive hurricane
We'd have to be responsible users and respect the rules of God
I'll just take a load off and have to buy them all

And I would proclaim, I'm the new proprietor of a sound
In a press conference held downtown when the people would look at me
In this state I would, I would simply say
At least you have someone to blame for a near perfect day

I would proclaim, I'm the new proprietor of a sound
In a press conference held downtown when the people would look at me
In this state I would, I would simply say
At least you have someone to blame",Nature Co. [*]
Evan & Jaron,"We tried for something better, now we just get by
Knowing we may never get it right
If we don't spend our days
Steppin' round each other
Then we find new ways to fight
About the weather

Every night I lay in bed
Thinking â??bout someone else instead
â??Cause who you are isn't who you said

Now we're stuck here
Standin' in the middle of a mess we've made
It's all to little too late
You call your mother, I write a song
We've come to agree that we can't get along
Why can't I say goodbye
Why can't I say goodbye

You changed and all you wanted was for me to change
Well, why couldn't you just stay the same
Now all I see are piles of dirty dishes
And a laundry list of all our wasted wishes

Every morning when I wake
I see your angel face
And I know you're dreaming of a better place

I guess I'm waiting on you
To come and tell me we're through
But as time goes by, it gets a little easier
To hide from the truth

Now you wrote a poem, I called your mother
We still disagree but you know we'll stay together

Now we're stuck here
Standin' in the middle of a mess we've made
It's all to little too late
It's the end of the call
The end of the song
We still disagree and we can't get along
Why can't I say goodbye

Evan & Jaron,"I plan to take every moment that you are
And hang them on the wall
I can't explain what you did for me
But I can frame them all

And when I say goodnight
I'll find you there
Staring at me with those eyes
And walking me to the bedroom
And oh, I wish I could see you back
I hope you're fine wherever you are
And know that I think about you all the time

I smile through the blue for you
Even though it's hard to stay awake some days
Baby I smile sometimes through the blue for you
Even though I know you're a million miles away

I had to leave work early again today
Everyone thinks I'm lazy
I wanted to be home when you got there
I must be going crazy
â??Cause when I say goodnight I find you there
You're staring at me with those eyes
And walking me to the bedroom
Oh, I wish I could see you back
I hope you're fine wherever you are
That you're with me all the time

Sometimes I wake up to the sweet sounds of the earth
And I wonder is that you
Sometimes in the morning when I order my coffee
I order one for you

Baby I smile through the blue for you
Even though I know you're a million miles away
And I'll never understand why you went away",Through the Blue
Evan & Jaron,"We sure looked good on paper
â??Til we read between the lines
It always hurts when you find
You're running out of â??latersâ?? and â??maybe next timesâ??
When you can almost read her mind

She likes the romance, the slow dance
Staying out all night
She likes the Christmas lights all year round
Why put â??em up, take â??em down
She watches baseball, hates the mall
And hangs out with â??the guysâ??
That's what I know about what she likes
About what she likes

She's all about the rainbow
But not the one on Sunset Boulevard
I got it wrong, she took it hard
And it really hurts to let go when you're so close
To making it so far

I should have known that I
Never could have known that I
Could ever know enough about her to keep her mine

She likes the romance, the slow dance

Evan & Jaron,"Softly I hear you call and surely you're after it all
You tell me you know just who I am
That's a felony 'cause no one can

I can only look back when I stand all on my own
I know a friend and I'll tell you when I see one
I'm reaching back again can I make it if I run

Where were you when I was naked in the cold
Where were you when my thoughts were growing old
Where were you

The train has left the station with no chartered destination
If you don't have a ticket in your hand it's too late to ride

Evan Christopher,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Evan Marshall,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Evan Marshall,"As I write this letter, send my love to you
Remember that I'll always be in love with you
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever
 
P.S. I love you, you, you, you
As I write this letter, send my love to you
Remember that I'll always be in love with you
 
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do, love, you, you, you, you",P.S. I Love You
Evan Marshall,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Evan Milby,"We are perfectly imperfect 
From day one everyone is searching 
Just to know the reason for existence 
And we find it here in your presence 
So stop waiting to be better 
You're already more than enough 
'Cause you're all that love needs to 
Turn your world around 

We are We are the anthem for the ordinary 
We sing We sing the song of the unprofound 
Empty hands open hearts 
Crying out use us now 
We are We are the anthem for the ordinary 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh 

Calling generation hopeful 
We are fallen chosen people 
'Cause it's so much for got it all together 
So don't stand back its now or never 
Just stop waiting to be better 
You're already more than enough 
Cause you're all that love needs 
To turn your world around

'Cause we won't be counted out anymore. 
We're the voices crying out for more. 
'Cause its time to live out loud everything we're created for.",Anthem for the Ordinary
Evan Olson,"Too much, too little for a conversation
Too much, too little for me
To change my ways
I'm giving up giving this situation
I'm giving up all the things that I can't change

[Chorus:]
When all my dreams
Shatter in a million things
Though I did everything I could do
Even if we die tonight
It'll do me good to know we tried
Even though some dreams never come true

Sometimes, I'm living in desperation
Sometimes, I can't believe the things I say
I need some beautiful inspiration
I need somebody to tell me it's okay

[Chorus]

We both know that there's a reason
No one needs to know what's wrong this time
I'm just glad that we're still breathing
'Cause a life of regret makes it harder to forget

Evan Palazzo,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin'

Fill me with flaming desire
Setting my being completely on fire
You and the night and the music
Thrill me but will we be one
After the night and the music are done

Until the pale light of dawn and in daylight
Hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning will come without warning and take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love 'til the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you?

With a bang
She was there
Yeah she blew up off my cover,
Wasn't looking for a lover
And I crashed
I fell a part
And now I'm picking up the pieces
No, they're not exactly reese's
But it's a start
Did you ever think I'd let you go?
You're the only thing I've ever known

And she went right.
And I went wrong.
By the time I turn around and look for her over my shoulder she was gone.
I'll never know
How to make her favorite drink
And does she like the color pink
And hate her toes?
But did you think I'd let you go?
I Think I always knew that we'd grow old.

Its like twisted sister
Meets mr mister.
It's like a shout at the devil (shout, oh)
Meets a careless whisper.
It's like Motorhead and the grateful dead in a game of twister
It's like boy meets girl.

When I when I saw you,I could see.
I wanna wanna have you lying next to me.
I wish that I can take it back.
Put you on my favorite track, and play ya on repeat
And every day since then is incomplete.

Always warm on my back

Sealed with lies through so many tears

I'll never be
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me

Birthing a dawn to this endless night
Arms outstretched, awaiting me
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree

Rest in me and I'll comfort you
I have lived and I died for you
Abide in me and I vow to you
I will never forsake you

And watch my purple sky fly over me

The nightmare I built my own world to escape

You know I can't stay long
All I wanted to say was
I love you and I'm not afraid
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me in your arms

Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you
Sweet raptured light,
It ends here tonight.

I'll miss the winter
A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest
Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)
I know you hear me,
I can taste it in your tears.

Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you
Sweet raptured light,
It ends here tonight.

Closing your eyes to disappear
You pray your dreams will leave you here,
But still you wake and know the truth -
No one's there.

Say goodnight, don't be afraid
Calling me, calling me, as you fade to black.

Have you forgotten all I know
And all we had?
You saw me mourning my love for you

I knew you loved me then

Too small to matter,
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces.

Convince me that I've been sick forever.
And all of this,
Will make sense when I get better.

Between myself and my reflection.

Well, as much as it hurts,
Ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

I'm not afraid
I push through the pain
And I'm on fire
I remember how to breathe again

As much as it hurts
Ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?
I will find a way even without wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
And we've gone to the end of the dream",End of the Dream

Is tearing apart at the seams

I'm waking up in someone else's life

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this lie

Not gonna let this day go by
I'm gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way

Burn it til there's nothing left

Is it so hard for you?

To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this lie

There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame for it all

And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

As much as I'd like the past not to exist it still does
And as much as I'd like to feel like I belong here
I'm just as scared as you

I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time

A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Can't keep pretending everything's going to be alright
With the whole world falling down on me

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Fallen so far from where we were before
You'll never find what you've been searching for
Something to fill the void
And make up for all of those missing pieces of you
Like I could only dream to do

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Oh, we never learn
So we fall down again
Heaven, help me find a way to dream within this nightmare

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine

Hid your stash box cause we on that shit 
Run that ice cause we on that shit 
Keep a loaded clip cause we on that shit 
Ryde or die nigga cause we on that shit 
We out to get it all cause we on that shit 
And Eve don't play cause she takes no shit 

[Eve] 
Uh, yo, yo, yo 
I shoot backing out, P max them out 
And the only way I don't get shit is if you stash the house 
Professional bitches, destined for riches and precious jewels 
Distracted by the size of my ass, had you fooled 
I ain't getting' nada, forget that 
Just sit back and watch me take everything even you're drough sack 
Yeah my bitch can roll with, 
Expensive paintings on your wall, gimme that 
Ain't no slacking, time ain't a factor 
I'ma get it all 
Used to ball with your niggas 
Now I'm making you crawl across the floor 
Ego crushed and I don't give a fuck 
Small change to the range, heard what I said 
Give it up 
I know it ain't right, but me and my bitches gotta eat tonight 
And every night from now on, get it right 
Why, why ask why? 
I'm simply living and I get what I want 
By simply taking or you're simply giving 

[Chorus]

[Eve] 
y'all niggas faggottish 
Cops spot me got me running out my kiss 
Unlatch the ice pieces on my neck and wrist 
Screeching in the streets from the five series to a ditch 
I'm fast, he'd have to waste it and I ain't scared to blast 
Ducking, jumping over shit, bet this bitch could last 
Ready for war, act like I ain't done this shit before 
Practice on me next week, I'll be wanting more 
Best believe you ain't gonna live to see tomorrow 
My dogs already warned your mother 
She'll be full of sorrow 
Busting through the door, somebody's house, kids screaming 
I ain't gonna front somehow I wish that I was sleeping, dreaming 
Too late it's done now, all you hear is gun sounds 
Cock back, pop, pop, pop, and I'm like what now 
Ghetto bird on me, weaving through the trees 
Last fence I hopped over, fell and landed on my knees 
Barrels at my temple, hey yo fuck it I'ma make it simple

Brick house stallion, think you tamin' me right?

Mad they man is obsessed and stalkin' me
If he icy enough, I'm pricin' his stuff
Be nicy enough to let him spend, I'm callin' ya bluff

Snatched up the illest viscous pitbull in a skirt

Stoppin' your shine, and I do it to perfection
Made a promise everytime I touch the mic to bless 'em
Used to tease me how I keep is greasy just to test 'em

Cheater, that be you check your beeper 9-1-1
Never Eve stressin' for your lovin'
I don't want none
Peep her, two seater
Look at you nigga actin' like you need her
You run blocks with your henney on the rocks
You don't think I see you wiling, thirsty nigga want the cock, uh
Let you live for a minute 'fore I slide off
Get you mad, holla no smokey ride off
Stressing me, you ain't blessing me
With your 96 Rolley glistening and impressing me
Hear me though, want a job need a resume, ready though
Cause my time is like Presume
You got petty dough and I'm here to let you know
My time is priceless, so if you iceless, baby girl gotta go

[Chorus Missy: x2]
Ain't got no dough
Broke ass niggas ain't got cash flow
Why'all know why'all can't buy shit
See me in the club trying to impress this, heh

[Eve]
Yo, yo
You can say I'm bless I know
Niggas like 'em flashy drive a F50
Jets I go, go-tee y'all blow, H-why-dro
Keep 'em leaning the club
Hoochies screaming y'all don't know
Many bitches follow me
Daddy licking out your tongue, want to swallow me
Want to pile me, never put no smile on me
Better stop that
Want to see me beggin' for your chips
Bet I doubt that
What ya looking at huh?
Still speakin' to me think you pushin' it huh?
Know you pussy cat run
Cause this bitch is gonna bite
I don't light fire
Grab it, choke it, hold it down
Ride it ruff ryde
I can give you what you need
Or give you what you like
But the pay is kind of the low
So this pussy pawn stride
Wishin' you could touch me, lust me
Listen up daddy you ain't ready for the bed
Try-na to give it up

[Chorus]

Yo, yo
Swizz got beats locked
Every time I drop shit's hot
Think not and it don't stop
This bitch top notch and
Y'all keep watching
Play the back baby while your team keep flockin'
Try-na to touch my ass
You ain't got the strength to mount this stallion, I pass
Whiling out I dash
To that type of thug that's about they business
Piling out that cash
Long line of credit cause I like my thug to last
See they like it when I talk back
Dough stack, cut backs, we don't want that
Frontin' but you flaunt that
Somethin' whatcha want black
Cheap stack, keep that
Fake money nigga, fake thug
We don't need that
What's that all about
I can see you from a mile running at the mouth
Lies poppin' out
Claimin' you's a hustlin' type of nigga, cut it out
You's an average type of cat
No money, no clout

When Missy flow I give y'all fever, yo
If your bitch is ugly you don't need her
Feed her to a wild pack of cheetas
Yo I let y'all bitches see I'm off the meter, heater

Then we treat you like skeezers, yo let me

Now for every real dog
There's that bitch that's behind him
That bitch that when that nigga get to missin'
She gon' find him
Old girl gonna stand with the dog
Hand in hand with the dog
And whatever the fuck went down she ran with the dog
First time I had a match and didn't scratch
You catch just loss half you niggas, but the punk can fetch
And I know my baby girl is gonna stretch
Any rappin' motherfucker, male or female
Place your bets
You can imagine what the bloodline is like
Since I love mine to fight
I'm on some shit like what time tonight
y'all niggas can't be for real
Cause any one of you fagots
Will catch a face full of lead
Bitch you shouldn't be fagots
Fuckin' maggots, once you have it, as good as I got it
I know my hands is in my pockets
But Eve got you spotted, red dotted
Eve didn't before the Dog
Nothin' but a walk in the park

[Eve]
Always been the bitch that could roll with a thug and
Wipe up the blood
Roll in the mud with your other ducks nigga what?
What you need when the chips is down
I'll abide on the stand when evidence is found
I give pound to ya niggas they respect this bitch
I spit rounds at your enemy no less than six
Always keep the extra clip Dog taught me well
The extra eyes on your team I see who's next to fail
Always hold your back up, I pick it up when you slack up
And if attention gets to close I tell the world to back up
Bind too tight, rhymes who ride?
Bitch and you livin' nigga lessons through life
Fuckin' with the dog he's the master
Plus he's gonna show me how to blast ya
Bullets hit you then pass you
Split you then stash you
The game is real, E-V-E, DMX, the name's for real, uh

[Chorus DMX: x2]
Fuckin' with the dog man niggas keep beefin'
Eve will hold it down now, niggas can believe (Woo!)
Quick as niggas come and quick as they'll be leavin' (Ugh!)

Get em girl, ha-ha, that's my baby
I'mma put the bitch down, cause the boy got rabies
All my pups is crazy, cause off the leash
They can eat, stand a match for 3 hours at least
And if the beast is in the big one
The beast is in the little ones
Talkin' 'bout let's hit him son
Fuckin' with the little guns
y'all niggaz had a little run
What more do you want?
For your fans you can front
But the dog is on the hunt

[Eve]
You know I'm at the door point fox rippin' 'em out
And you're the only one that can tame me
When I'm flipping 'em out
Bite's lethal, no recovering
I spits no other than acid
Up against the top contenders
None of them lasted
This bitch goin' always hold you down
Keep the cowards thinking twice
I keeps it gritty nigga
Never think that love is life
Turnin' my back is something cats would do
I never take flight
Cause any breed he put's me up against
This bitch is gonna bite

[Eve]
Yo, Yo, this nigga lookin' like love, no doubt
Sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest
And, stay reminiscin' bout the rest
And, how they less than, trying to come between what we share
Can't compare, could have been left
But when it's mine, I never share, fight to the death
If need be to prove that, wounds from your war
Other bitches couldn't soothe that, broke from a bad back
I'm holdin' you down, throwin' dirt with other bitches
But them other fishes drown, locked in, for however long
I'm playin' it smart, court dates in other cities
There I'm playinÃ¢?T my part, wif-ey, in ya life see
Forever be us, passenger side of a Bentley
Or the number 2 bus, tell the whole world, papi
EVE don't want nobody else, with other niggas pick and choose
But you, I'm keepin' for myself

[Chorus: x2]

All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious
But the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It made a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, uh-huh, fuck it keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you wit me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a motherfucker, uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad 'cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me

[Chorus: x2]

I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
It's some thug shit things see him in the party, start to flip
(What the fuck?)
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin' the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowing my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, EVE the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time

My story

Went from dancing on tabletops to making labels pop
For the love of the money so I could cock everything from icy rings to drop
Tops and now I'm on top
But to look back on my reality happy I stopped
Letting niggas ruin my world impressed by niggas trying to school this baby
Girl I was fucking too early
15 knowing money was green
Puffing too early, body big, not grown knowledge'd up and too early
Thought it was cute to flirt with older kats up in they face
Didn't have a daddy so I put a daddy in his face
My mami was my shelter but I broke free
Learning that the streets was harder that I thought they'd be
Wanting to be grown, rebelling
Ain't no telling what I'd be pussy selling (huh) never would I
Instead I wore a g-string
Thought never could I
Thought I had to, to be grown beginning of my life

[Chorus]

Yo, close myself down
Held myself in
Explode by myself alone no one helping
What am I to do but cry alone at night
No one in the house nude TV is my life
Who was I to tell and what would they think of me
No one understood the pain that was sent to me
Broke down from the things men would say to me
Selling drinks to a naive kid
I blame me
But I never really had someone tell me what to do
Teach me that I'm better than just pussy that's true
Teach me that the future was written already waiting to respect my self in
Life not to be someone would hate me
Do positive and positive will happen
Stay positive and positive was rapping
It was like my brain was clouded with unnecessary shit
But I chose to see through the negative and make hits uh

[Chorus]

Uh, uh, yo, yo
Now I'm 20 years old and look where I'm at
I thank the Lord every night and pray there's no turning back
I wanna keep my family happy and that's that
Seen tears in my mother's eyes from platinum plaques
See things I've done I don't regret I just learn
From mistakes in the past knowing now I had to earn respect and earn trust
Survival school was never giving
The way you find out what life's about is simply living to be strong
Stay strong let nobody crush you your body is your temple young girls
Don't let him touch you
He'll respect anything you say if he really loves you
Don't settle for second let him put no one above you
I did a lot of things in my life
I take back gotta take from the good and the bad collect that
Cause it help the bill who you see now respect that
Young, black, and strong keep me in ya

Eve,"Hey, yo I don't even know you and I hate you
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you

She was in love and I'd ask her how? I mean why?
What kind of love from a n**** would black your eye?
What kind of love from a n**** every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a n**** make you wish he would die?

I mean s*** he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That n**** had the power to make you crawl for him

I thought you was a doctor be on call for him
Smacked you down cause he said you was too tall for him, huh?
That wasn't love, babygirl you was dreamin'
I could have killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen

[Chorus: x2]
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself
She had a baby by your a** and you ain't giving no help

Uh-huh big time hustler, snake motherf***er
One's born everyday and everyday she was your sucker
How could you beat the mother of your children?
How could you tell her that you lover her?

Don't give a f*** if she lives
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Sweet kisses, baby didn't even know she was your mistress

Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your b****es
Floss like you possess her, tellin' me to mind my business
Said that it was her life and stay the f*** out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip

[Chorus: x2]

I don't even know you and I want you dead
Don't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead

Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up

You heard my gun c***
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend
I ain't start your life but n**** I'mma bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets

?Member cops comin' in, watch me going to jail
N**** whatever my b****, f*** it my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live
What our love was all about

I considered her my blood and it don't come no thicker

This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit 
Hitting wit the hardest Shit, cause before we started shit 
Wit kids I knew my friends all turned against me 
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this 
He got my back I got his, scheming on mad niggas 
That's how we do bids
It's about time to start another, robbing spree 
Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump 
When I was up north, since 16 I was sending niggas home in a coffin 
Living like a orphan, you bad nigga? 
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here 
You know my style I'll put yo fucking man, in a wheelchair 
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me 
Thats how I left him G, scared to death of me 
Cannot run, hit wit the hot one 
From the shotgun, cats was close, wondered how we got done

Yo yo, E-V-E 
My dogz believe in me 
Petty thugz hide yo cake, never teasing me 
I show love to, all my bitches hustling one's, tussle wit thieves 
Making moves, second to none, I locked it, uh 
Made a sudden move you got bit 
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit 
The blond hair bandit, you got guns, hand it 
Turn my face when I bust a cannon 
Cause I don't wear sunblock 
Ask Drag if the fire is hot 
shit pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop 
We warn niggas that we coming then we hold up the blocks 
scorn niggas like their mothers then we wet up their socks 
red dye, escaping on the red eye ,sea shores then hide out 
buy out bars till we see fall 
Believe in this game, we beat y'all, you got money? 
Keep y'alls, for us be tearing trying to hide, then our fire 
Beat y'alls

And you can come see me if you trying to make a gram tonight 
Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white

Blowing the haze, while all of em giving me brains

everybody wanna contact me and get wit me 
but still end up being mad Cause i charge fifty 
and as for you sucker, you can keep those rapz 
and Screw your awards, my son can't eat those plaques 
I never was shit but some things i never forget 
like if you spend three your guaranteed to make back six 
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off 
Tints, rims, stashed, tick the governor off 
Even the cats that be hating still be loving the dogs 
Cause they know that the double R's coming for war

Like I wasn't hustling dope or robbing the blocks 
Starving or not, carving the cheek, palming the glock 
I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch 
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist 
Put it together, double it twice,this shit is my life 
Catch me wit a 45, hot pair of Nikes 
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face 
Gimmie a shank It's Holiday ugh

For those who can't see the light, it's comin'
Stay strong, feel me

[Teena Marie]
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah,

[Chorus: Teena Marie]
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars

[Eve]
Thank you God, I appreciate every blessin'
Happiness to heartaches, take it as a lesson
I learned a lot in this year

Got a profession that keeps me stressin'
Facin' criticism, answerin' questions
And you still keep me happy and healthy
Blessed with a mind to play the cards that life has dealt me

No doubt I struggle, I cry at times
Sometimes I wish I could live in a bubble
And it gets hard not to stray to trouble
I'm proud of me, got a family that holds me down

Real friends 'cause the other ones claim they don't know me now
But long as God with me, I'ma be good for sure
He's the one who picks me up when my face is to the floor
Life is crazy, people never cease to amaze me

Stay with stories by how they made me or raised me
And it's funny, 'cause everybody seems to be so hungry
Either they want my life, or they want my money

[Chorus]

[Teena Marie]
How can life be so hard?
How can my life be so hard?
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Every day I pray to God
Every day I pray
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Eve]
Been through a lot
Still gotta watch my back 'cause people plot
Close is to do you dirty just so they can take your spot
Some days I feel like I want to quit

But I pray too long and dreamed and worked too hard for it
Wouldn't trade my life, none even a little bit
'Cause it could be worse for real, I could be turnin tricks
Might bitch and whine but always just in the back of my mind

I could be livin' on the streets, nothin' to eat without a dime
So I thank God, and I think why 'cause life's hard
Meet a lot of people but always I'm puttin' up my guard
'Cause you never know, some people snakes

Some people give a lot but mostly not, most people take
A lot of smilin,' claimin' realness but most people fake
Still gotta smile, 'cause that's what it takes
Sometimes it's lonely

I feel like people see me really don't know me
But my best friend is Him, and I know He'll hold me

[Chorus]

[Eve]
I got a lot of people on my side protectin' me

Gotta thank God for them 'cause they keep me right

I also thank Him every day for the love of my life
I thank Him, for this gift just to be able to write
And rock crowds that scream my name, able to excite
Thank God for my fans; I love the way they love me

Happy that I'm comfortable, eatin, livin lovely
I love my life, still there's the pressure and pain
So I make sure that I'm grounded and able to maintain
A lot of people think I'm lucky, travelin and hangin out

But if they only knew, I +WISH+ I could be hangin out
I'm bangin out hits, in the studio I'm livin low
Makin plans to last a lifetime, make sure I'm gettin dough
Huh, come on, just so the people know
Uhh, come on, just so the people know

And you know how we do baby creep in the fog
Now hold it down for the fellas, hold it down for the
girls
Keep motherfuckers knowing this rap shit is our world
(What!)
Been there and done that, had fun where the run
at 
Don't got to shoot a motherfucker no more so put the
gun back 
Pay niggas to do that, cause they a lot better at it
Keep the burner in the truck cause well you got to
have it (aight)
It's an unwritten law (uh huh)
Let a fagot open that unwritten door (uh huh)
Hit 'em with four  hairline to the jaw (what!)
That's what I'm aiming at
We going to get that nigga X aight well keep saying
that
Eve I wish you the best and I'll always love you

Never hear me say FUCK YOU because I love you (what)
Always here for you when somebody else is not 
A dog and his bitch blowing up the spot
Come on

[Chorus: x2]

[Eve]
It should be against the law, me and the dog like a
brawl
And the only thing that can help you is God and you
should call on him
Weak sight, the streets like, creep like
Cause they got each other's she bark and he bite
It ain't strange you cats know the name
Double are bubble hard it's a shame
Realest niggas doing it, them clowns they ruin it
Shut 'em down give 'em pounds cause palms go glue in it
Sticky finger niggas steal each other's style
Claiming how they started things not original
Cats they get caught up in the glitter and glam
If that's the case you should be considered a fan
I'm like tired of the same beats that claim streets
Doing nothing but ducking from the hood got the same
speech
Only one you feeling is you niggas know the deal
Industry, fuck it, in the streets keep it real, nigga

[Chorus: x2]

[DMX]
Since the beginning we both knew we was winning
Cause we been in all type of shit  but kept on
spitting, hitting
Niggas in the head with that shit that let 'em know it
was the truth
So they feel that cause it's real black (WHAT!)
We never going to stop, no matter what they say

No matter what they do  they'll never take it away
(Come On)
What the Lord give you let no man curse
E-V-E and DMX from the birth to the earth

[Eve]
Why they sick cause we still close thought that it was over
Cats trying to tear us apart dogs got closer
All the shit we deal with only make us stronger
Try to do a lot of shit but they can't belong to
For real niggas scared us, steady catching thembluffing
What you say shut up nigga saying much of nothing
Act like they don't want it but they demand it
Double are keep it hard and niggas can't stand it

Can I turn you on by my word's spell?
Look into my eyes think I want you, can't tell 
Me I keep it sexy, daddy so I can't fail 
Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell 
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash 
Wrist glist now cause I make a gang of cash 
Light glance, still street with the do-rag 
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that?
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed game game around me, I run the game 
If I gotta keep it gritty so be it, I'm supposed to change 
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't messin' with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch check what I've been through 
Got mine took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dog I ownin' dot coms

Yo, yo I can understand why you're scared of Eve 
Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me 
Huh, mad cause an image I don't care to be 
Realness, real shit, spit reality 
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I 
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life 
Breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair 
Why you listening to other shit?
You go the best here
Come on try your luck shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there 
Ain't known for frontin' vouch for my behavior, 
Same way they get down I get down for this paper 
Sixteen lean from my pence so you can test her
Still need to know who I am then cop the record 
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line my world, my way any questions 

[Chorus]

Uh, yo power moves is made everyday by this thorough bitch 
I'ma get this bank anyway that I do this shit 
I was born to shine while most of y'all was borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want from me, you cats is clueless, 
Dispose the flow through my hands like water 
Heat starts growing from my son or my daughter 
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her 
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her 
All ball is played, won't starve today 
Song after song I write so I get paid 
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now bitch swallow it up while I shut it down 
Make em love me over again and over your name 
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame 
Why you lookign sad at me, I ain't the blame
Back to plan be	 baby I can feel your pain 

[Chorus]",Who's That Girl?
Eve,"First time I seen your face I was like damn
Put your arm around my waist I was like man
Gentle with the touch I ain't fuss still a strong hand
I ain't know if I should lust or play it like a man
True I'm human like you but gotta play it smart
Questions I gotta ask for we get this start
Pulse racing fast damn can you feel my heart
Got me feeling wild yeah you doing your player part
Trying to feel you up excuse me I mean feel you out
What your life like tell me what your mind about
Oh you ain't even tryin' to share no secrets straight to bis
Wifey, baby mother, you got any kids
One word answers oh I ain't feeling that
Then the pain for american express black
But I'm a play it cool and let you think you running things
You seem official long as you ain't runnin names

[Chorus: x2]
You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touching on me (you know you want it)
But I got go

Listen baby you know that I'm attracted to you crazy
But I ain't gonna play stupid so you can try to play me
You ain't really telling me shit and tryin' slay me
And on the real this quiet shit is starting to drive me crazy
The only thing that's keeping me still is sex appeal
Strong but silent type is that you what the deal you
Know what I like on me gotta keep it real
Something in my mind saying that you probably got the skills
But I ain't giving in your friends they feminine
And I don't know how many of them you might be swimming in
But them lips though make me wanna try my luck
Straight thug what I love and you got me stuck
Cause you dress right I'm supposed to be pressed right
But on the real you got me thinking if I could be blessed tonight
Let me stop thinking these things it's not polite
I wanna give it to you raw but I'ma put up a fight

[Chorus: x2]

From subliminal seduction not really touching
But like rubbing acting like you wanting nothing
Your eyes say it all playboy but you no rushing
Treat me like your pray only your sexual hunting
I'm running fronting cause really I'm wanting to
Let you lay me down pound for pound we be crushing
I'm tight vexed cause I'm really dwelling on the sex
Chills up my spine the way you smelling up my neck
I'm like putty in your hands I gotta keep my composure
Plus I'm tryin' to remember how long I really known ya
You make it hard fighting you off is like a job
But I'm doing good so far body starting to throb
Should I give in ready to open my garage
And let you park in the dark but damn I gotta
Fight you off gotta roll out but before I leave
You need know that dinner was lovely but I really gotta go",You Ain't Gettin' None

The news that your moving got me standing outside
Use to be rubber ducky late nights no wine
Mrs. Lovely Vessel body all mine
Girl went to shoot me with the shoot all mind
Sweet like a puppy, is so hard to find
And I know you don't love me, I'm reading the signs
Cause there's no where to go since you left me behind
(Now it's TRUE, TRUE) that I loved you for truth
(TRUE, TRUE) she stick like ankle glue
(TRUE, TRUE) I make your gray skies blue
(TRUE, TRUE) you want me pers-nal boo
Chilling up on the house our love be that strong
DJ's steady playing on the one's and two's

[Chorus: x2]","No, No, No"
Eve,"They usually hate her when she comes around
Huh, first lady mobbin' nigga hit the ground
Next break into that who we what a sound
Heads boppin', never fails once the doc's around
Hatin' the fact that she do things on both sides
But never disrespect two rings round both eyes, right?
Lady like in many ways
Because in trust I can be crazy like on any day
Some do they dirt but best believe in time they pay
Do believe in lettin' shit chill 'til the promised day
Huh, seems they just fade away
I love it 'cause them clowns they just paved the way
Left it wide open got no time to play
Mad 'cause shit changed got no time to stay
Considered snobby then just hate me I don't give a fuck
Considered sloppy to me you just need to give it up

Eve don't give a fuck about you
That's what it is
Eve is the hottest bitch
That's what it is
But she gon' stay ladylike
That's what it is
But I'ma act crazy like

Think I got your house shot
That's what it is
Think I got your car burnt
That's what it is
Think I got your people robbed
That's what it is
'cause we don't give a fuck about you
That's what it is

I ain't got a moment to waste
I'm tryin' to get to your head, so I gotta make room in your face
And they can't see your eyes or your nose
Why P? 'cause four, five slugs is consumin' the place
This is holiday you need, you fuck with the scorpion
I don't stop poppin' till your body don't breathe
Clap more than the audience, after the show
Stab more than the butcher and I'm kinda righteous
So I'ma help you pray for the Lord when I push you
She, the first lady, I'm the ghost with the gun
Aimed at your son that'll love to burst crazy
Ruff ridin' the clique, come up outta your shit
Get clapped in the wig, sold a lotta records
But we never gave a fuck so it's a wrap for the kids
Got to the back and the ribs
We the hood, even holiday bitch that's what it is

Eve don't give a fuck about you
That's what it is
Eve is the hottest bitch
That's what it is
But she gon' stay ladylike

Think I got your car burnt
That's what it is
Think I got your people robbed
That's what it is
'cause we don't give a fuck about you
That's what it is

Broke out and got grown, holdin' her own
That bitch come strong, give up, dead wrong
I don't even fuck around 'less your head strong
Ain't too many that's around that can match they mind blown
Can't figure her out
Is she street, sweet, gutter, I'm from the hood
A lotta y'all niggaz gold
This bitch two million sold
And I just figured that I'd make it known
Baby girl got the whole world in her palm, alone
Watch me rock, got my lip cocked
Spit fire, watch it better duck, you stuck, you crossfire
Thought you was the realest you said you caught, liar
Any time you at where I be, I'ma try you
(I'ma try you)

Eve don't give a fuck about you

I be the D-are-A-G dash ya niggas foot slim
Cause bullets make your feet fast
We throw babies in the trash
Drag don't play with little gats
Crib like McDonald's nothing but Big Macs
And quarter pounds
Bitch place your order now stay in line
I only fuck with broke niggas
That straight depend on crime
You straight pussy so fuck your ass cap
Cause in jail they'll put your cap where
Your ass at you ass black
Projects that's where Drag at
Yea ya got heart
But if I don't got my gun
That's where ya gonna get stabbed at
Boy as a young I never grabbed that toy
Drag was taught to grab that and ask
""Where the cash at""

[Sheek]
You think we shoot his pocket sides
Deuce deuce and 25's
You ain't takin' em' nigga
You threatenin' lives
I ain't frontin motherfucker
I don't shoot no legs
I'm tryin' to see if your brains
Really look like eggs
Or is it just that commercial
Your brain on drugs
Now it's a total different look
From these shotgun slugs
To get rich it could take less than two days
I'm like them little beepers
Half's and bullets two-ways
Fuck vests my shit go through toupees
I'ma thug in New York
And when I'm on your set
We the apartment where they filmed
Good times at
Bitch what the fuck I'ma thug nigga

[Chorus: x2]
I'ma thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fucking with me I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now I'm doing my thing
Like a motherfucking dog I'm doing my thing

[Styles]
Weight on my back
Hate in my heart
Blood in my eye
Foot on the gas
Blunt in my mouth
Loving the ride
Hand on the gun
Ear to the street
Back to the wall
Mind on my money while I'm clapping at y'all

[Jadakiss]
I got niggas in jail
Crack in the hood
Hustle in south
Fiends and customers
That run in your house
I got family ties
I'm handy with knives
I live my life in the ghetto
Nose candy and nines
I'm deeper than most
Sleep wit it close
Wake wit a demon
Have visions of the whole
World shaking and screaming

[Styles]
I was born to be a leader
But if the game was dirty
I was born to be a cheater
You talking to me greasy
I was going to get the heater

[Jadakiss]
You tell me what you know about blow
Getting dough and straight warrin' with a meaner
Fronting in a Benz or I was soarin' in a Bima

[Styles]
Lyin in the cut
The gun is straight running
Like a tire on the trucks
If he is real or a liar
Put the player to his nuts
Or the fire to his guts

[Jadakiss]
Cause niggas is too soft
That heat make niggas cool off
Fuck ice I'm tryin' to cop the crew lofts

[Styles]
So we can be back in effect
I throw the barrel to the back of your neck
And hop back in the vette (corvette)

[Jadakiss]
Cause everybody is a felon with loot
Cause they say rap is like dust

[Styles and Jadakiss]
And we the only ones sellin' the juice

[Chorus: x2]

[Eve]
Bitches is so sick
They throw up
So scared they don't even
Come around in places that I show up
Go ahead nigga put your dough up
Me against who nigga grow up
Bitches choke can't even get their flow up
I ain't got no fear bout you bitches in the industry
Acting all confused don't know who you supposed to be
Chickens lost steady worrying bout
Who's dick is tossed
Stop stallin' better get this thing before it's gone
But I ain't mad
Cause I ain't gon' pass it on
Callin' askin can you get on my shit
Cause your cash is gone
You won't get no sales off of me
Bitch please
Pitbull run with dogs
I don't like fleas

[Chorus: x2]",Thug in the Street
Eve,"[Chorus:Repeat x2]
You had me, You lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad

Uh, uh
How should I start it off
You must have thought me soft
Like it was all good to move on and cross me off
We never shared secrets
We wasn't fucking raw
Helped you when you were down and now you got the fucking gall
We used to be so tight
We was each others life
You was my husband and no doubt I was your fucking wife
Did anything you ever asked of Eve
You turned out to be a devil nigga I couldn't believe
Sneaking numbers out my phone
Calling bitches on the cell
What the hell!
Clunky bitches one on the scale
I'm like a dime over line
You can't calculate my status
And you fucking with these bitches like my ass wasn't the fattest
Like I didn't dress the baddest
Any time we surface
Must have been insecure
Niggas made you nervous
And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in
But you fucked up
Your lucks out
But then again

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Used to let shit slide
Caught a couple lies
I chilled for real, I mean I called a couple guys
Knew when you was fucking up, I saw it in your eyes
Then I guess it was my fault cause I put up the disguise
In public we was happy
In home we'd be scrapping
Later we'd be naked, joking, smoking and laughing
Making up to Break up
I thought that shit was love
But it wasn't and I learned the hard was soaking in suds
Crying all depressed
Not again You'll never catch me
Wishing on a star for some nigga to come bless me
I tried to save it
All you ever did was stress me
Pushing all me buttons
Why the fuck must you stress me
Nigga get a life
Go on and find a wife
Get the fuck out my face â??fore I go and find a knife
And you still calling my phone trying to act polite
Asking me for favors now you know that shit ain't right
But

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Uh-oh
You see me coming don't you
Look at you running won't you
Oh you gonna sit there and see me like I want to approach you
Now it's payback
I'm talking way back
To bitches calling hanging up
You ain't no way to save that
To unanswered questions
To home in the a.m.
To you out clubbing 
Forcing me to stay in
Remember, okay then
It's over, no playing
I said it before
I'm about to do it, fuck what you saying
To late for apologies
Go puff on a pile of weed
Think about this good bitch that's leaving and don't follow me
Moving on
Shut you down
Now you want to regret
You could fuck all day
But it would never feel like my sex
Played yourself
Tried to show I cared
You ain't cared
When I needed you the most nigga you wasn't there
And the game is the same
Comes around goes around
Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around

Bet against her, take a loss
And I ain't slackin' up
I gotta win at any cause

Ayyo I bet you can't stop her

Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn she much thinner know now I'm complete
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on

Yo
I'm in a position to help a lot of people
When I love it, but people that claim that they love me
Want to take advantage of it
I duck 'em, I can't lie that toss a lot of lies
Can't trust the story tears swellin' in my eyes
Let my pen stab the page, times I feel raged
Sometimes I feel trapped got me locked in a cage
But I break free
Won't never let the anger overtake me
'cause actions of another never make 'e or break 'e
(Hum)

I never let 'em shake me
And no matter what I always wish excessive thos' who hate me
The ones they call my enemies
Who only will be wanna be friends of me

Who wouldn't trade mind for nothin' not for anything

And yea I know I'm livin' blessed
And if I didn't make it here, my life would be a mess
Can't live a life of fear
All that get you is nowhere surrounded by a bunch of stress
And I always had a hard head

Had a choice to play around wit life or listen to a gossip
So I straightened up and I'm doin' right
Growin' every year, hey yo' this thing ain't happen' overnight
But I still got a lot to do
And never givin' up 'cause anything I feel I know is possible
Don't never let people discourage
Plant yo'll see the dream, baby and let 'em flourish
Lettin' you in on what I know

Styles: Eve let's do it again! Hahaha...

[Verse 1: Styles]
Yea it's the ghost Jada and Eve
I squeeze my shit, I don't wave it and leave
why'all motherfuckin' extra lame
Here's the game, when I shoot seeds, your man can catch your brain
He looked a hero when he drove the taxi in the hallway
Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'ma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I leave a message, ain't a phone I use
I call my niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise
Leave 50 niggas dead, niggas know my groove
Another 20 more engine niggas know my tools
I got a gun, you need to stand fo'
FUCK YOU BRING YO' MAN FO'?!

[Chorus: Styles, Jadakiss, Eve]
Styles: S be the ghost, Double are What
First come the hawk, then next come the toast

Jadakiss: K to the are Double are what
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah

Eve: E-V-E, Double are What
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ryde or Die, Double are What
Better keep your hammer right by your side

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I gave you the best flows
On top of that, I even made niggas set goals
I want to know how many bullets can your flesh hold
Thirty-two, or whatever the tech holes
My dirty crew rather hawk you to death rather than talk you to death
'Cause listenin' is like livin' when yo' talkin' is death
So why'all better start readin' before you start bleedin'
And the odds was against us before we got EVE-n
Niggas in the hood don't give a fuck if you rich
Or drunk with the Prince CD own, bumpin' a kiss
Nigga frontin' I get my you in the pump kinda hot out
Hit the button put the roof in the trunk

[Verse 3: Eve]
I'm a savage bitch
Ain't nobody gettin' close to this
And ain't nobody flipped and wrote the shit
And can't nobody sit and coach this shit
You feelin' lucky? then aproach me, shit
I'm like the glass, you just the coaster bitch; Under me!
You want to make it ugly, can't do nothin' 'bout it
Angry at the public, buggin' me
Rat bitch, pot bitch, hungover hot bitch
Wantin' all that money, fuckin' gettin' all that rock, shiiit
Scared of who? huh, we goin' get rid of you
Climbin' the walls wit' gimmicks, that shit is pitiful
Dawgs close by me, so why try me
They wan' cop me but they too sloppy
Damn, I gotchu stuck in a box
You feelin' trapped, got your stomach in knots
'Cause I ain't lettin' go
I keepin' it locked
I know you gettin' mad 'cause your luck's up
Plus I'm a purebread, baby, I don't fuck with mutts
Come on!

Now I ain't ever been the type to
Not excite ya
Can't miss the vixen that meant ya like her
Play ya position, just might invite ya
Party till the mornin if she like ya
I ain't attracted to no lame dudes,
Don't want to name a few
Don't lie either so don't ask
She might be namin you
When I'm allergic to these corny bitches
Tryna start shit to end my ? I'm too up on my riches
?Gang? been a part of me, dawg, and I'm'ma keep winnin
Never shoulda started me off
I love the way I'm livin
And they wonder why she won't stop
Sit around mumblin to myself hopin that my shit flop
Now that's the shit I like to laugh at
Obsessed with my every move
Dummy, find a crash test
Every year I'm just a little wiser
And yo it's still gon be left in the race ?

Eve,"[Chorus]
Lady look I'm tryin' to figure you out (OK)
I'm tryin' to find out what you all about (Yeah)
Baby girl I wanna get in ya head (My head?)
Damn is you everything that you said? (No Doubt)
Mean no harm. I admire ya style 
Just take a second baby here me out
I know ya game you tryin' to make me shout
Yo look I'm just tryin' to figure you out

He approached me boldly. Said he felt me said I'm looking lonely
I had to stop 'em. Tell him daddy chill cause you don't know me
He said listen ma mean no harm
Just wanna let you know my story yo, don't be alarmed
Usually I'm like the bitchy type
I'm quick to hit 'em wit a 'Ha yeah, OK aight'
'What's ya name again?'
But I was feeling dude
And to my surprise for once I wasn't being rude
had these eyes that'll make you melt
So what its corny. That's the way I felt
Had this body not a big deal but it helped
I mean this nigga had some shit wit 'em
And every time I tried to talk
he grabbed my hand and said sweetheart just listen

[Chorus]

Felt like I was little. Got me back to shy days
Is he being real or is he comin at me sideways?
Said he want a build wit me. I'm like here we go
Said he was a regular nigga that liked my flow
Confidence is key wit me so I let him go on
Casanova saying shit like damn you got a glow on
I'm like he did his homework knowing what I like
Cant find nothing wrong on 'em and he might be my type
Continued wit his story bout his 3 years in jail
How he missed the streets cause being in there was like hell
Bout his little daughter Kira center of his world
His princess and she know she daddy's little girl
I'm looking at his face-I looked at my watch
He smiled said he wished that time would stop
I apologized to 'em cause I didnt mean to be rude
He said 'I know you busy. Just really wanted to meet you.'

[Chorus]

Asked me if I had a man I said that I didn't
Wanted to know if he could be that wit my permission
Told 'em that I wasn't ready. He said 'Yeah right'
Told me that I need a real nigga in my life
I agreed wit 'em. Told him that'll come soon
Let him know that I enjoyed the talk but had to run soon
He asked when's the last time I took time for me?
And if I ever reflected on how shit could be
He told me I was blessed. I said 'Dog I know it'
He said just a reminder. Feel that way and never blow it, huh
Slipped me his number said use it for inspiration
Kissed my cheek and whispered thank you for your conversation,
huh

I keep some chuck's on my feet khakis on my legs
Trunk full of funk nigga while I'm breaking bread
Sliding through your system banging, bobbing heads
Doing mines and I don't care what other niggas saying
They can pop it, but they can't stop it, boy I'm getting mine
Selling clothes up in this bitch like Calvin Klein
Getting cuties to shake they booty at the same time
I'd be damned If I go back to jail for the same crime
I'm to slick to get caught up in this dirty game
I'm a scollar that make dollars off the birdy game
Crip hoping I got it popping on the Blvd.
Man I ain't fucking with Chevy's I got my own car
D-O Double you don't want to rumble, why you testing me
Oh I know, you must be gone off them extacy
Bad habits you better kick it before it get you loc
And try to get yourself hooked on this chronic smoke
Fo' sho!

Hey y'all, dogs from East to West Coast

And this chick got the drums from your ears throbbing
Known to do it, baby bubbling do 'chu dare stop it
Love when bitches hate you, hear the song pimps
ain't nothing to me, Got my nigga Snoop he been down
As for my nigga Nate, shit he was in town
created heat so you can bang it, crank it nice and loud
Can't block me out I'm popping up Evie Eve, I'm upon your tv
Ain't never stuck up off the freezyness
Same bitch, same pitch nothing ridiculous
Want this brown girl I see you thug lick your lips
Gotta have that bombshell, damn girl I need you for me
Keep love on the both sides, we in the church
On these niggas getting smoke ties, domino playing
Up here praying that they legalize, but fuck it still choke top down
Baby blowing smoke in the sky, come on

[Chorus]

[Eve]
Now when you see me acting up in the club (it ain't nothing)
Uh six fall up on dub's (it ain't nothing)
Huh breaking up blueberry buds (it ain't nothing)
And every hood showing nothing but love (it ain't nothing)
Taste buds ain't the same, for the simple brain
Should of never let me learn what millions really mean
Yea I'm a simple girl, but really don't want simple things
Keep real dogs close, hate cats with simple brains
Not ready for the collision, stay up in your lane
East coast, West coast, you still don't fucking think
Dedicate to you baby, keep your gangsta lean

Most dudes is okay (Half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they want to do (Reality they can't)

We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm sick of that

Yea it's hard, breakin' up ain't never easy, believe me
But fuck that, I wasn't gettin' treated like I needs be
But trust, I was controllin' all the things around me
But shit, I always been this chick ever since you found me
I tried and I tried, cried and I cried
Down for you nigga wit' lie after lie, after lie
Got sick of tradin' games wit' you
Started bein' jealous of me like dames would do
I'm like dawg, check ya balls, mad 'cause I receive applause
Men in my life was against the law
Startin' fights in public just so you could piss me off
I swear, if I was a dude it'd be fist to jaw
Always mad at my mouth 'cause I cursed you out
Missin' hard, know you feelin' what these verses 'bout
Doin' dumb shit, breakin' things, hidin' my phone
I'm outta 'dis here, pimp jus' leave me alone

You and me should just let this go

I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on

I had to get away, I'm past the stress
Mama told me baby girl never settle for less
Learn the hard way, hard days, I'm ready for next
A bunch of leavin', I don't need Eve's shit, I'm doin' me
Soon as pack you sippin', with the booze, you and me
Reminiscin' 'bout the way you was pursuin' me
Actin' like your period on screamin' you doin' me
Well, bye dawg, have a nice life, I'm fine dawg
Don't try to track me down or call 'cause that line off
Hope you feelin' bad without me, see if you can laugh without me
Cry what tears? I'm happy, I'm free
Still ridin' past the spots that you know I go
Procrastinatin' wit' yo niggas hopin' that I show
Never know what you have 'till it's gone
Wonder what she doin'? Best believe she doin' her

I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on

Funny, how it happens when you fall in love
When you find out that the one you wit ain't who you want
Then you move out 'til you find yourself anotha love
But your ex gone always hate 'cause he can't hit you off
You don't hear me though

Claim you wanna please me, yet you vex me
Can't front, be thinkin' 'bout the way you used to sex me
God damn, days short, nights was long
And I was mad when I started spendin' nights alone
But I'm better off by myself lookin' for somethin' else
Sendin' me shit you can't pronounce, I don't want nothin' else
Wanted to love you until the end of my time
But fuck it, I'm done wit' you at the end of this line

You and me should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on

Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate

Some days I be wantin' to get away, from it all
To be real this game ain't all it seem to y'all
I mean I'm blessed by my good God high, that no question
And I know my journeys long just a life learned lesson
But the world's just a mess right now, gone all crazy
Thankful for my single mother, strong how she raised me
Could've gave up long time and been lazy
But my dream's strong, hear this song I'm not complainin'

Just the realisation, livin' in this world of dreamin'
I mean I cry real tears and I got real fears
Want a marriage and some babies, do ya'll hear me in ya ears?
Discouraging, keep ya courage and walk ya path
Question everyday, ""How much longer will we last?""
How can you apologize for mankind?
No heart, no soul got sight but yo, the man blind
Not really seeing what he done to the future, he lost

Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me

Love, hate, pain, all the same
Still took for granted, either reason that's to blame
Gone 'coz he loved her, gone 'coz she hated him
Flipped out, taken out from the pain, who she datin' him?
It's like we don't have no meanin', what we breathin' for?
Birth, child raised right, gone now, fightin' for the war
Damn! Enough to make you crawl up in a shell
Cry for the innocent babies in this hell

Stuck from a fast fuck no shelter from the cold
Drugs and disease never growin' to be old
Do you feel me? Am I seein' all this by myself?
Can't trust the air I breathe, I'm prayin' for my health
Wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin' songs, let it flow
I said I wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin' songs, let it flow

Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me

Sometimes my heart hurt
Wish I could take away the pain with music
But it won't work, I guess I'm just an optimist
What's it gonna take for all o' us to stand up, put a stop to this?
Man, we in this thing together
Live and breathe together
Everybody love life but never make it better
Everybody talk shit but never get together

Shit, I ain't tryin' to preach I ain't even teachin'
This some shit that's bottled up inside me, I'm just speakin'
Wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin songs let it flow
I said I wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it

I ain't givin' up or lettin' up, advice? Step it up
Slow down, cause your mistakes is catchin' up
Fan's a fan and you scramblin', I'm sittin' pretty
Ain't nothing left but me standing and you ain't wit me
Sob stories all you left wit cause it's over
Some say I'm mad, naw, I'm just a little colder

You know what this is, got the crowd like WHAT!
Ain't a bitch alive that can take my WHAT!
This time when I come, it's gone be like WHAT!
It ain't hard to tell you just been done

[Verse Three: Eve]
I'm the boss of this, know the cost when you floss wit this
Got you lost like ""Excuse me, miss?""
Can't give up, you step, I jump five steps ahead
Need new shit, old tactics is dead
Anything that you thought was the shit, it ain't
All the things that you thought you could do, you can't
While I'm here, heh... stay prepared
Veins in ya eyes while you stare, nose flared out
Same as it used to be, niggas clear out
Open spaces, heh, I replaced it
Disappointment on all ya faces
Cheer up, back to the basics, I geared up
Settled this, stuck, and I'm here, what?
What you gonna do to take me out? Nothing!
But thank you cause you caked me out
Watched you, studied you, made me better
Played you, faded you, now they sweat her
Got through the door only cause they let her
Dose of the first was cool, but it gets better
Yeah... shit gets better

[Chorus: Truth Hurts]

[Styles]
Yea it's the ghost Jada and Eve
I squeeze my shit, I don't wave it and leave
Y'all motherfuckin' extra lame
Here's the game, when I shoot seeds, your man can catch your brain
He looked a hero when he drove the taxi in the hallway
Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'ma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I leave a message, ain't a phone I use
I call my niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise
Leave 50 niggas dead, niggas know my groove
Another 20 more engine niggas know my tools
I got a gun, you need to stand fo'
Fuck you bring yo man fo?

Better keep your hammer right by your side

I gave you the best flows
On top of that, I even made niggas set goals
I wanna know how many bullets can your flesh hold
Thirty-two, or whatever the tech holes
My dirty crew rather hawk you to death rather than talk you to
death
'Cause listenin' is like livin' when yo' talkin' is death
So y'all better start readin' before you start bleedin'
And the odds was against us before we got EVE-n
Niggas in the hood don't give a fuck if you rich
Or drunk with the Prince CD own, bumpin' a kiss
Nigga frontin' I get my you in the pump kinda hot out
Hit the button put the roof in the trunk
Play the block with the Royal Blue 45 and make your mouth leak
Can't fuck with NY
Get my diesel from South Beach
you ain't got a ride, get yu a cab
ya' bitches is mad
Eve got the shit and smash

[Chorus]

[Eve]
I'm a savage bitch
Ain't nobody gettin' close to this
And ain't nobody flipped and wrote the shit
And can't nobody sit and coach this shit
You feelin' lucky? then approach me, shit
I'm like the glass, you just the coaster bitch, Under me!
You wanna make it ugly, can't do nothin' 'bout it
Angry at the public, buggin' me
Rat bitch, pot bitch, hungover hot bitch
Wantin' all that money, fuckin' gettin' all that rock, shit
Scared of who? huh, we goin' get rid of you
Climbin' the walls wit' gimmicks, that shit is pitiful
Dawgs close by me, so why try me
They wan' cop me but they too sloppy
Damn, I gotchu stuck in a box
You feelin' trapped, got your stomach in knots
'Cause I ain't lettin' go
I keepin' it locked
I know you gettin' mad 'cause your luck's up
Plus I'm a pure bread, baby, I don't fuck with mutts
Come on!

Gotta be special to see my world

To get with E V E you gotta have skills
So if you want it come and get it

Man you need to stop, can’t you see I’m outta your league?

Shots of Henny and soda, man we twist it and roll it
From the door to the sofa she scream my name like yo mother
She tell me that I’m the hottest, I say correction – the coldest
We did it all night, she wake up makin mimosas
Gotta er caught in the feelings, textin me to the mention
She givin me up her heart and we create a cause in a minute

Watch how they leave you standing there,
Just leave you all alone

Swear I won't look back if I get chance
Oh, I won't come back around

Yo, have you ever laid in bed and it's late in the night
Staring at the ceiling talking to God about life?
Asking when it's gonna happen, just maybe it might
Made a lot of life turns, some wrong and some right
Wanna know when it's your second, your minute, your time
Sick of dreaming, wanna lay the pictures in your mind
Never been like all the others, you're one of a kind
I know you're feeling like you wanna break free, it's a sign
Just wanna fly above it all, see where you can land
Know that you can do it on your own cause you can
Know that you can conquer all with a plan
Forget about the negatives buried in the sand
Yeah, never forget this is your life
Your path, your dream, this is your fight
Victory you'll see, you'll be alright
Get through the darkness, on the other end is pure light

Have you ever felt alone like the whole world was missing?
And when you prayed it seemed like no one was listening
You try to keep the faith and keep on living
But when you struggling the future looks distant
All your hope seem to be just pipe dreams
And you really gotta wonder what your life means
That's when you gotta pick yourself up out the dust
Make a change and find a place in your heart you trust
You ain't always gotta take the first card your dealt
In this life only you can represent yourself
Never let your circumstances hold you back
You were born free, never gotta feel trapped
And on the pursuit to happiness you're gonna feel pain
But the only way to win is to stay in the game
The naysayers they're gonna try and embarrass ya
But I've learned that the struggle builds character

Goodbye, it's over, it's through and done
Our relationship is no longer one on one
So I quit, girl, I don't need this
I'm disgraced cause in my face you spit
I caught you steppin out with another guy
And after givin you my love I deserve to know why
How long has this been going on?
How long have you been doin me wrong?
You thought I didn't know?
You thought I'd never go?
Well, that's why I'm makin this song
To say goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 2: Everlast ]
Pack your bags and leave, get out of my sight
I won't share you with another man on any night
You tried to play me for a fool
But now you'll find that you been schooled
By the E and it's plain to see
You thought you had luck like a four-leaf clover
Your luck just ran out, homegirl, it's over
I hope you had a lot a fun
Were you lyin when you said that I was number one?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter
It makes no difference
I caught you with a smokin gun
Or so to speak, girl, you're a natural sneak
And the hand you dealt me was really weak
But that's alright, you won't see me cryin
I brush a girl off when I catch her lyin
So when I toss you out, don't dare ask why
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

You think I'll stick around so you keep abusing me?
Wise up girl, I ain't playin
You try to make it better sayin let's hit the hay and
Make love, then I'll know that you're loyal
But I can't take the stress, don't need the turmoil
You told me that you love me but it was a lie
You know that I care but I must say goodbye
Who is it you're thinkin about when we're kissin?
And when we're all alone is it him that you're missin?
I couldn't stand the feelin that I got
When I seen another man standin in my spot
Next to you, so what you want me to do?
Forget about it act like it never happened?
Turn the other cheek and wait to get slapped again?
Or until you say when, you're through with me
But you will see I'll be the first one to say goodb-why-e
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why

I must admit it, you hid it well
Did you get your kicks puttin me through hell?
Runnin around with your new found child
He's not a man, he can't get wild
But that's alright, girl, you made your choice
And maybe by now you're sick of my voice
But it's too bad cause you made me mad
And I'ma show you all the things that you mighta had
Then you'll be the one feelin pain and misery
Regrettin the past (goodbye) cause you're history
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why
Don't tug at my sleeve as I walk by
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye

And talk so small I can't remember every single word

Laced with think naivete
Firm delusions can't be swayed
Tell yourself you're happy
We both know the truth

It's false behind the dirty talk
The dirty sheets
The sexy walk

Your heart is open wide

There is something up my sleeve

You and me that you can't see

Honesty's a virtue that can hurt you

The thought that counts is
Counting down the minutes 'till I leave

It's sickening how comforting the privacy of the mind can be
How much longer will I try before I realize I'm desperate in the situation
that I'm in again

I've exhausted frequently with no regrets

The telephone doesn't scare me anymore
You're home
And I am here alone
My dear
Always stupidly sarcastic
My hyper, spastic superhero girl.

So break the bruised monogamy
And let him fade to memory
And your erotic wet atomic eyes
Keep reoccurring in my mind
Do me a favor please
And touch your lips to mine.

No I don't kiss and tell
I'll tell you after I've betrayed you
Supersonic boy sweating sin
The pillar that I'm melting on you
Will prove you wrong
Keep your lips sealed this just in
You're speeding up the ticker
Of a walking time bomb
Time's up
Stand up and face the muzak
Smile wide
Step outside.

Click your sticks
And cast a spell that'll suck my saliva like water from a well
I try to do what's right
What's right ain't right enough
For you tonight.
I see you're displeased
A middle finger response
I'll try to appease
I'm sorry, don't be mad.
But ask me what I'm sorry for
And I won't have an answer...

Knock off his glasses

Pardon me sir, can I use your eraser
To remove my brain of unconventional nature.

Find a sidekick pronto I should 
Think Thelma not Daria
So I search hard and near and far for 

Someone the description called for
Thought seldom not Daria
Found her in a suburban wasteland 
Swaddling clothed and caked in beach sand

At first sight thought that I might turn and 
Run out of fear and intrigue
I stood numb kind of military 
I'd found her I'd keep her

Safe and sound
Don't make a sound
Look up at the sky shit's going down
I heard a bang and stars collided

Her skin drew me in just like a magnet
Little girl my little world is yours

I took a one way highway headed West heaven bound
Never even thought once to turn round
Real life plays tricks on the brain
Pointed fingers were left in the dust and The ones who doubted rusted

We're out of here like Vladimir
Now I'm looking at a picture where I'm right beside you
Eyes shine with a light that binds you
To this fool with Super Glue

From all the way across the nation
You came with just your name and 
Your suitcase I'll keep you

Safe and sound
Don't make a sound
Look up at the sky shit's going down

October light show bright through the windshield
Right into my eyes where I was silent riding shotgun
Chewing on some sugar free gum
Parallel park and pay the meter
'If I die before I leave tell her
I'll never leave her
I am just fine
I am just a little broken up
OK my nerves have never been so short
Can't get this shit off my mind
I just want to be alright
So tell her nothing's wrong
Then get undressed and spend the night
The autumn sun is burning logic in my brain
I'm asking why there is pleasure when there's pain
I'm here to pay for my mistakes in a humiliating manner
If there is a next time I'll cover up
I feel alone, I feel shaky and uncertian
A kind man shakes my hand and draws the curtain
In a word he saves my life and then
I exit out the enter door and smile
Can't get this shit off my mind
I just want to be alright
So just tell me nothing's wrong
Then get undressed and spend the night
I took a ride to meet an enemy
I faced a fear of mine and shivered but didn't blink
I took a ride to meet an enemy to end all the madness
And now I know that I'll be fine
I am fine

I get a feeling and she starts to grin
Adjusted my pants as my face turns to red
Foresight is so often blind

Just take the 2 to the 134
But first take the elevator to my floor
It's good to be bad if it's better than bored
Foresight is so often blind
Slur to a favorite rhyme

Girl eyes tend to hypnotize
The trance is so divine
Decide to be the reason why
I stay another night

Vodkareening through the hotel door
Guilty is really a choice and a chore
It's good to be bad if it's better than bored
Foresight is so often blind
Slur to a favorite rhyme and that's when

Girl eyes tend to hypnotize
The trance is so divine
Decide to be the reason why
I stay another night

I took her hand and then an aspirin in the morning
I took her hand and took her home

Singing dreams inside my head
I'm heading out
I've got some ends who say they care
And they just might
Run away with you
If things don't go as planned
Plannin' big could be a gamble
I've already rolled the dice

I spit and stutter stuff and clutter
Worries in my worried corner

Just untrusted
Rusted
Sometimes brilliant trusted thoughts
Think ill stay for a while

I promise not to mind if you go your way and I go mine
I promise not to lie if I'm looking you straight in the eye
I promise not to lie and not to let you down

I am all smiled and dated
In my man bites dog small town
With a Spanish name
I am my own bone
I am two toned

In the backyard stars shone brighter than the others
That I rarely see through the smog through the haze that covers
The home that I used to live in
Well I kind of sort of knew what was going to happen
When she put her number down on a restaurant napkin
She said goodbye I think the words were when you're back in
Town let's have each other again I'll come around and see you again

Animated vixen stole Cupid's arrow and came to rescue me
In the blink of an eyelid my lid opened up and I could see
That she'd come to rescue me

I tasted southern sin with a girl who was just perfection
Had a two room condo back in a wealthy section
Of the Florida flatlands where she had me kept in
A wicked trance for a day
Well I kind of sort of knew what was going to happen
When she and a friend came and met me in Atlanta
I professed my love in an animalistic manner
Like an endless foreign flick my subtitles were sick

In the blink of an eyelid my lid opened up and I could see
That she'd come to rescue me

Well I kind of sort of saw the sirens coming
She was running toward me wearing almost nothing
And my heart beat skipped when she bent down at the hip
And her lips pressed against mine

Promise that forever we will never get better at growing up and learning to lie
I'm on my way back home now

Will mine be told while I'm still young and horney
I know my role is to be a confusion
Set the clock back when I'm growing old

Never wanted to be like you or all the rest
I've always been the first one to settle for second best

Eve 6,"Hey Montana take your daughter back
From the bathrooms of Angeles Vall

She believes in destiny
Her name's always mispelled
Waitressing to pay he rent
Drinks to quell the smel
Of people breathing way too close
Folks who don't mean well

No one sees the color of your eyes
No one sees you smile
No one knows the secrets that you hide
No one sees you cry

She parks her car two blocks away
From apartment 15A
She walks with somber in her step
And scores along the way

Blue's your hue you tiny thing
Dropping patrons wine
Singing to your own sad song
Two feet stuck in the mire

It's clear she needs your care
These bustling streets are icy vains
Of a beast who snuffs her prayer

Saw her standing in the street in a hat made out of skin 
Underneath a stormy sky like a Heroine, 
Over me came the feeling that i'd never win

Save me 
Stop sneaking pain to the cranium, 
Blame me, Let me out from underneath your thumb

I know a girl she's from the plains of South Dakota
Drives around inside a home that has a motor
Her mama told her not to so she crossed the border
Her hair was long, she dyed it black and cut it shorter
I heard she fed a cocker-spaniel to a cobra
And I don't know if I believe it but I'm gonna
Step inside her magic ride
And roll the fuzzy dice

See every seven wonder before the age of forty

Evelyn Evelyn,"Evelyn, Evelyn,
Why do we bother to stay?
Why are you running away?
Don’t you feel like severing?
Everything’s just come together at last
It’s broken, I don’t want to play

We grew up closer than most
Closer than anything, closer than anything
Shared our bed and wore the same clothes
Talked about everything, spoke about so many things

What shall we wear tonight? What shall we eat today?
Can we go ice skating? But we just did that yesterday
Should we be firemen? Can we be astronauts?
What if they find us? They’re not looking anyway

Fill my glass, let’s drink a toast
This is our birthday, so why are we weeping?
At your side, I feel like a ghost
I wake up first, and I stare at you sleeping

What shall we wear tonight? What shall we eat today?
Do you think I should marry him? But we just met him yesterday
Should we be movie stars? Will we be millionaires?
I want to be famous They're watching us anyway

We grew up so very close
A parasite needs a host
I’m only trying to do what is best for us
Well, I never asked for this, I never wanted this
All that I want is some time to myself
Looking in your eyes, I’m coming home
Just get away from me, please just stop touching me
You’re always trying to be somebody else
Now I realize I’m not alone
Well, you’re only scared of me
But you never cared for me
Why don’t you let me free?
‘Cause you’d never dare to be
‘Cause you never listen, you’re always insisting

I feel something missing

Evelyn Evelyn,"You pulled up at the house at half past seven 
In your '69 Impala, you shook hands with my father 
And we stopped off at the drug store by the drive-in 
For some Trojans and a six-pack, but still your eyes 
Kept wandering back to her
It's always her
So let's get one thing straightened out here, sir

[Chorus]
If you think you're seeing double, let me save you some trouble
This ain't no two-for-one bargain here mister
'Cause I'm much more than just my side
Had enough of two-timing guys who only want me 
'Cause they want my sister

My eyes are just as blue as her's
My hair is just as fine, and that tattoo on her lower back's 
Exactly just like mine
But if you look beneath the surface
We're as different as can be
'Cause there's just one heart that beats for you and 
That heart belongs to me and not to her
It's always her 
So let's get one thing straight if I'm your girl

[Chorus]

Hoo-ooh

And if tomorrow you should die my sister would not bat an eye
She doesn't even know your name
She's going with some other guy
As long as she is still around I'll always have a trace of doubt
I need to know your love is real, but how?

We're all dressed up, the flowers sure are pretty
Mother pays her last respects I look around, no one suspects that it was me
I put some Drain-O in her coffee
Now that she is underground I'll know that you're not hanging
'Round for her, not for her
Now I know your love is true for sure

[Chorus]

It pains my heart to think of her a rotting
Stinking, maggot-infested, bloated and pus-oozing corpse that I leave her
You can't imagine just how much I miss her
But now I know you want me, not my sister",You Only Want Me 'Cause You Want My Sister

And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me"

Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know

Terrible creatures and bound to roll past you,

[Chorus:]
I don't want to be wasted
I don't want to live inside this daydream anymore
I just want to be happy again

I don't want to be wasted
I don't want to be blind

[Chorus]

I don't want to be wasted
I don't want to be blind (x 3)

I wish I could be like all my heroes
I wish I could be like all yours too
I wish I could sing like Otis Redding
I wish I could play this guitar in tune

Do you remember when we were hungry
Do you remember when we were cold
Do you remember when we were happy
In a way, no one outside
Could ever know

I wish I had one more life...

How I wish I had one more life to live

[Chorus]

I don't want to be wasted
I don't want to be blind

[Chorus]

I don't want to be wasted
I don't want to be (x 2)

I don't want to be wasted
I don't want to be blind

I don't want to be blind",Otis Redding
Everclear,"The only thing that ever made sense to me
Is the words to a song from an American movie
The only thing that ever made sense in my life
Is the sound of my little girl laughing
Through the window of a summer night

I sit alone in the back yard
Wishing I could be inside
Just the sound of my little girl laughing
Makes me happy just to be alive","Song from an American Movie, Pt. 1"

Yeah I wish we had never bought
A king size bed

That it's ever been good for
Is plenty room for the real good sex

I lay in bed in the dark
And all that I can see
Is the distance that grows between us
You seem so far from me

Yes I think we are headed for a real big fall

A little bit strange
I have one thing to say
Before I turn and I walk away

A little impulsive

But you and I
We will be together
Someday
Someday

I know, I know, I sound
Like I'm on drugs
But listen to me now
When I say

That ever since when I first saw you
Sitting on your car outside
You asked for a cigarette
I couldn't stop staring
At your eyes

Ever since when I first saw you
Looking bored in that plastic chair
With the lights of the office
Around you
Those blond streaks
They look so pretty
In your black hair

You look cool and alternative
With that disaffected stare
You want people to think
That you just don't care

Hey you can be with me
'cause I just might be the one
Who will treat you like you're perfect
Who will always make you come

You can be with me
I will always let you win
I will never be like those other guys
I will never be your
Unemployed boyfriend

This is gonna sound
A little bit out there
This is gonna sound
A little insane
But I keep having the same dream
That you will
Be the mother of my children
Someday

Someday

I heard you sleep with that
Obnoxious guy
I know he is in that famous band
You look so sad when you
Are with him
I never see him reach
To hold your hand

You can be with me
Yes I will treat you like a queen
I will go to all those
Chick flick movies
That I really don't want to see

You can be with me
No I will never let you down
I will never make out
With your girlfriend
When I know you're not around

You can be with me
Yeah I just might be the one
Who will treat you like you're special
I will always make you come

You can be with me
I will always let you win
I will never be like those other guys
I will never be like those other guys!

I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again

Hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
Hear them scream, I hear them fight
Say bad words that make me want to cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed
And I dream of angels that make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Tell me everything is wonderful now

(Na na na na na na na)

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all okay
I like to laugh so my friends won't know
When the bell rings I just don't want to go home

Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world is so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
When you tell me everything is wonderful now

I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now

I don't want to hear you say
That I will understand someday
No, no, no, no
I don't want to hear you say
We both have grown in a different way
No, no, no, no
I don't want to meet your friends
And I don't want to start over again
I just want to my life to be the same
Just like it used to be
Some days I hate everything
I hate everything
Everyone and everything

Everclear,"Yes I think it's safe to say
I feel good about the place
That I have made in the world today
I get all sticky inside
When I close my eyes and I open up wide

I see pictures in the clouds
So obscene I gotta laugh out loud
I look back to find my way
And reminisce nice about the good old days

Yeah, when I saw my brother above me
I remember the words he said
""When you dream you hit bottom
Chances are good you're gonna wake up dead""

I will be up on top when the sky falls down
And It all goes wrong again

Yeah,
I will be sitting on top when it all goes wrong again
Yeah,
I will be sitting on top when it all goes wrong

Yes I think it's safe to say
I feel good about the sin
That I inflict on my own skin
I pay money to cut and burn
Pictures like lessons that I need to learn

I see faces on the ceiling
I see them move
I hear them singing
I lay laughing here by myself
And think about the time that I spent in Hell

When I saw my brother below me
I remember the words he said
""When you need to wake up happy
You better sleep right in your own warm bed""

I will be singing in the rain
When my beds on fire and it all goes wrong again

Whoa,
I will be singing in the rain 
When it all goes wrong again
Whoa...whoa,
I will be singing in the rain
When it all goes wrong

Where are you gonna be
When it all comes down?
What are you gonna do
When it all comes down?
What are you gonna be
When it all comes down?
What are you gonna do
When it all comes down on you?

Sitting on top of the world
(When it all goes wrong again)
I'll be sitting on top of the world

I will be sitting on top when the sky falls down

When it all goes wrong again
Whoa...whoa,

When it all goes wrong again

The voices drop hard
But the eyes still stare
The world resolves into a
Death's head grin
Because i walk with pride
With a black girlfriend

My mom said not to bring her around
Cause she's black
My family would put her down
I'll break the white-trash
Ties that bind
Trade a love so pure for
A hate so blind

She said -- she said
Forget the fact that i don't
Look like you
She said -- she said
You're possessed with a power
Bigger than the pain

Time stops when we lie so close
In my room where we share
What no one knows

From the day that we start
Until the day that we end
I know i know i know now
We will never find a place
Where we could just fit in

Me and my black girlfriend

And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Everett Greene,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell
Everett Greene,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Everett Greene,"I used to dream about angels But then I never knew
That I'd ever meet one And such a sweet one
Till I met you

When did you leave heaven? How could they let you go?
How's ev'ry thing in Heaven? I'd like to know
Why did you trade Heaven for all these earthly things
Where di you hide your Halo?

Where did you lose your wings?
Have they missed you?
Can you get back in?

If Ikissed you would it be a sin?
I amonly human but you are so divine

Everett Greene,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty

Everett Greene,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before

Everett Rucker,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day

I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

Everette Harp,"There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you

When all of the stars were shining bright

We made our very first promise
To love, to share, and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater
You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing to you
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because, I'll never give up on you
