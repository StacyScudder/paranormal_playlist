Siti Nurhaliza,"Malam bertandang
Hati berbisik mengenang 
Cerita derita yang daku pendam

Kata menguji
Cuba untuk kusudahi
Berulang airmata membasahi

Aku kini perlu berdiri
Walau hakikatnya 
Pasti kan melukai

Aku ingin
Semua rasai
Kerna pengakhirnya hidup
Ku sendiri

Malam bertandang
Hati berbisik mengenang 
Cerita derita yang daku pendam

Aku kini perlu berdiri
Walau hakikatnya 
Pasti kan melukai

Oh tuhan kau berikan aku
Segala kekuatan 
Meneruskan
Perjalanan

Aku kini perlu berdiri
Walau hakikatnya 
Pasti kan melukai",Hati Berbisik
Sitti Navarro,"Kung ika?y magiging akin
Di ka na muling luluha pa
Pangakong di ka lolokohin

Kung ako ay papalarin
Na ako?y iyong mahal na rin
Pangakong ikaw lang ang iibigin
Magpakailanman

Di kita pipilitin
Sundin mo pang iyong damdamin
Hayaan nalang tumibok ang puso mo
Para sa akin

Kung ako ay mamalasin
At mayron ka nang ibang mahal
Ngunit patuloy ang aking pagibig
Magpakailanman

You can end this anytime you want to
Just jump out of the window
And feel your body break on the ground
Or you can come a little closer
Come ride my magic carpet
And follow stars to Bethlehem

You're such a better man that he
You're such a better man that he
You're such a better man that he
You're such a better man that he

We'll find faith in the most magical of places
And find home in the smallest of rooms
We'll find life in the most barrenness of faces
And touch Christ in impending doom
 
Lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo
Lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo
 
We can go anywhere you want to
I don't really mind
But follow the life on the moon
A life of pain to do
A curse from me to you

You're such a better man that he
You're such a better man that he
You're such a better man that he
You're such a better man that he

We'll find faith in the most magical of places
And find home in the smallest of rooms
We'll find life in the most barrenness of faces
And touch Christ in impending doom
 
We're singing
Heroes from your harsh dreams allow me closer
Signs from your palms read
We're so much colder
Ships sail out past the Persian coast to the edge of the world
And I've died
 
Lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo
 
You're such a better man that he",Better Man Than He

Sixwire,"I remember a boy in his back yard
And all the games he used to play
Looking for armies to conquer 
And dragons to slay
Fearlessly seeking adventure
Riding a make-believe steed
Swearing to all on his honor
To be all he can be, 'cause…

Chorus:
A brave soul fights the good fight
Defending his castle with all of his might
It's an age-old story of life, there are those
Depending on one brave soul

The day finally came when the soldier
Set out to take on the world
Armed with the heart of a warrior 
With his flag unfurled
But real life was not like the back yard
Now enemies are hard to define
The difference between good and evil
Is a very fine line, but…

(Chorus)

Now I'm behind the wheel of my Chrysler
At the end of my daily war
I pull in the drive and I wonder
What's it all for
Then I see a boy in the back yard
I smile at the games that he plays
He's counting on me to defend him
When there are dragons to slay

And a brave soul does all he can
And that makes a hero from an everyday man
He holds it all in his hands
Now I finally know that I am

(Chorus)

I remember a boy in his back yard
And all the games he used to play",Brave Soul
Sixwire,"I am lost—paid the cost
Double crossed by one heart
And I tried not to cry
As love died in my arms
You make each day a little better
Sometimes I still can't hold it together

Chorus:
I'm broken
In pieces on the ground
But I'm willing to try
So I'm keeping my
Heart open
Hoping love will come around
And find me again
Won't you save me
I'm broken

I have prayed every day for a way to believe
But I know in my soul how that goes
You could leave
I hang on every word you've told me
Just remember every time you hold me

(Chorus)

Baby help me put it all behind me
You're the only thing that doesn't remind me
I'm broken

(Chorus)",Broken
Sixwire,"I remember
It was September the third
When I said it all with just three little words
I know the way you wore your hair on that day
I know it sounds crazy—the heart's funny that way
But after all that you told me
I still gave it all that it's worth

Chorus:
I can't help how I feel
It's out of my hands
This time it's for real
I've gotta do all I can
With every kiss that I steal
The further I go
I can't help how I feel
Just like you can't help how you don't

I remember
It was December the fourth
When I finally asked you
Is it worth waiting for
I know you're still running from things in your past
I know nothing's changed, but I still had to ask
'Cause I just can't leave you
I'm just not that strong anymore

(Chorus)

I've got nothing to show
Still I can't let go

With every kiss that I steal
The further I go
I can't help how I feel

You're leaving—what am I missing?
Did I hear you say I never listen? Well…

I never heard when you cried
I never heard when you tried
To tell me that I was slowly losing you
I never heard you mention
I should've paid more attention
That's a fact
But when you said that you were leaving me flat
And you were never coming back
Baby, I heard that

I'll hang on to our love, tooth and nail
Keep my eye on every detail
I love you, and you're gonna know it
There's no way I'm gonna let you go unnoticed, 'cause…

I'm a new man and I can prove it
How could I have ever been so foolish

I hope she comes around

Chorus:
I try to have faith in us
Say it'll all work out
I try to keep my spirits up
While my defenses are all down
I try to rely on luck
But I know it may be running out
And all I can do now
Is hope she comes around

I've waited all I can
The silent phone is a lonely sound
It's making me a lonely man
I hope she comes around

I dream of holding her
I close my eyes and she's here somehow
So I'll let the porch light burn
I hope she comes around

Sixwire,"Jack is your neighbor—you see him every day
(He) picks up his paper and he throws you a wave
An ordinary man—seems like a heck of a guy
An average day in his average life
He hugs his kids and he kisses his wife
Then drives his minivan to his nine-to-five
No one knew a thing 'til they caught him on tape
Breaking into cars at the YMCA

Chorus:
Did you hear about Jack?
Everybody's talking
It wasn't such a straight and narrow line he was walking
No one can believe he would ever do a thing like that
But then you don't know Jack

There's more to this story that we haven't heard yet
But it seems our friend Jack had some gambling debt
That got out of hand—and he couldn't pay
And his eighty grand a year doesn't cover his bills
When he spends it all on prostitutes and pills
But a desperate man is gonna find a way
A wallet lying on the front seat of a car
Couldn't solve all his problems
But it's a good start

(Chorus)

Late last night, Jack went for a drive
He had a revelation down on I-65
He'd be worth more dead
Than he was alive

Did you hear about Jack?
It's all over town
They're not really sure about the way it went down
No one can believe he would ever do a thing like that
But then you don't know Jack
No you don't know Jack",Jack

It's hard to know which path to take
When you're constantly reminded 
Of all the times your heart would break
The odds are low of ever finding
Someone who'll go with you all the way

Waiting there at every turn
We both know sooner than later
We'll reach the point of no return

I promise you can take me at my word

Lost the wind in my sails
Then I'd have never needed redemption
If I hadn't lost my way

I would have drowned if not for your faith

Chorus:
You gave a lost and lonely man
Reason to live and the strength to stand
Where would I be without the love I see
In your face
You're my saving grace

Love had eluded me
It excluded me
And I'd lost all of my expectations

Merry Christmas.

That's what people say at Christmas, right?
Except normally they have someone to say it to.
They have friends and family,
And they haven't been crouched naked under a Christmas tree
with a needle in their arm like an insane person in a mansion in Van Nuys.
They're not out of their minds, they're not writing in a diary,
And they're definitely not watching their holiday spirit coagulate in a spoon.
I didn't speak to a single person today.
I thought why should I ruin their fucking Christmas.

I've started a new diary and this time I have a few new reasons.
One, I have no friends left.
Two, so I can read back and remember what I did the day before.
And three, so if I die, at least I leave a nice little suicide note of my life.

It's just me and you, diary. Welcome to my fucking life.

Nobody would believe the shit that happens inside my head, it's haunted.
Now I've come down from the drugs
it seems like a sick play that I saw in a theater somewhere.

Sixx: A.M.,"There's always struggle here
With senseless pain and murder
No mother's milk to sip
No innocence to nurture

May God be cruel to you
May he rain his hell upon you

We will grow strong from this
We will not be defeated
However hard they try
Over and over and over a thousand times

Through all this suffering
As fall turns into winter
We will be back again
And grown in new found numbers

Babylon set it so, building them bridges and fence 
That they may support them so-called government

Remind them that slavery was not an accident 
In return they kill my brothers and my parents

So long we a burn them fire 
Some a them want to bring down themselves into slavery 
A just Ethiopia the chant you know 

What does it worth, without love? 
Put away your distrust and your grudge 
Words without work is not enough 
And everyday you make a pull, the journey get rough 
What is this world without love? 
Put away your distrust and your grudge 
Words without work is not enough 
And everyday you make a try the journey get tough 

You remember when you trodding through the valleys of the region? 
Jumping the follies, all the doubts and confusion 
Giving obstacles, so many trouble you buck up on 
Things a go the other way 
When a never so you set your plan 
Words of the wicked is pollution 
Can bring no stress nor no strain in a Zion 
Emperor Selassie is the only foundation 
Only Emmanuel relieve the frustration 
You want to be free from the corruption 
Me tell you such is life from the creation 
Only Marcus Garvey show the situation 
I only chant for repatriation

Whatsoever it brings, it will have to stay 
According to your words, a double death you pay 
Keep the smile on your face, make it an easy day 
Me know them weak, so them gone astray 
Wolf amongst the sheep, them the same way 
See me and a creep for make a better way 
One man fly the seal, a King Selassie I me say
Some a them a sleep, even before them pray 
Getting it right a come a lion bay 
Through undivine only if you stay 
In a the right line, you see the right way 
Selassie will be blazing I praise him 
Remember that is blackness me still a say

There is no sense in turning back 
Get right by your friend, whether you are a idiot 
This world want love to put them out on top 
Some a them say that them have it 
But me know say them no have 
Much easier if we all could share 
No distrust nor envy must be in here 
Dirty mind people, a time for your care 
What is not yours, me say don't interfere

I'm not sure if I will live to see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lie cold
As gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work
Is taking off like an arrow

I'm not afraid to die, but to live until death
It's not hard for you to guess 
What will happen next
Heartaches and pain, works of ungodliness
Some nuh know why dem a live
That's when them have to hurt the flesh

But who are they
Tell me what they represent
I struggle with fear as I experience
How them do them dirty works which I resent
And no one but them a go face the consequence

Them build walls instead of bridges, of ridicule
Then war with whom they live, like a fool
But if I travel I'm not sure if I will live to see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Ah, where you water full
'Cause the vessel of the inequity
Never yet full 

[Chorus: 2X I wonder...]

That burning concern is no longer there
There filled with the medicine
When Babylon prepare
Instruments of cruelty present everywhere
Strong enough to take the life
But not enough to care

As the road gets dark, I expect anything
I know not my enemies
So it leave me wondering
Many life was lost, who is the next victim
It could be you, it could be I  
Through how them set the system

Them kill without a cause, what is the meaning
So no one knows what tomorrow may bring

[Chorus: 2X][I'm not sure... 2nd chorus I wonder...]

They are filled with corruption and selfishness
Overload with bitterness and wrath
So I have to seek to keep myself away
From the wicked on the roads they walk

Oh yes, them sow seed of conflict
Them wan fi see mi trick
But na go fester my heart
Because I dwell inna Jah sight
Man do what is right
Don't want it to be said that I never pay my part

Many ride with enemies
And I am my brother's keeper
What have I done
They no want to see me prosper
Push on this load as them make it heavier
Jaf, is only sorrow the wicked have to offer

I wonder...

Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows

When people say they don't love, they never see progress

‘Cause I myself know, without the Conquering Lion I would never endure

Verse: 2
When I heard them say play the music no more
I know they've been wounded by truths and rights so pure
And if they should say do away with the true source, 
       you know that they're unfair
Hey, they don't know how this come about now
All His great wisdom buildeth a true house, withstand everlasting

Verse: 3
After all you know the world has been taught
To be the system, that down press your very soul
You never know when they will lurks in the dark, 
Willing to do the killing, for a dollar they knock you down cold
Corrupt in their heart, no trust whatsoever
Who is so clever, to be under their take hold

Chorus:
‘Cause I myself know, that no man is an island, no man stand alone
I myself know, without the Conquering Lion, I would never endure

Verse: 4
When the people say there ain't no love, they never see no progress
Wouldn't right to let them be alone

Un animal, un cachorrito para que puedan jugar
Le separaron de su madre na mas nacer
Directo a esa puta urna de cristal
Usar y tirar, calienta el verano lo tengo que abandonar

Nadie le dijo que la carretera, seria su fiel y fría compañera
Nadie le dijo que en la carretera, moriría destripando en la cuneta

Miles de animales, son las victimas mortales
De unas mentes anormales que no tienen sensibilidad
Sensibilidad

Morir bajo las ruedas de un camión
Servir de carne de cañón, peleas en clandestinidad
Tétricas sesiones de dolor
Bastarda experimentación, con total impunidad

Tras el cristal, por la autopista les ves vagabundear
Sin descansar, sigue buscando sin rumbo su viejo hogar
Un alarido en la noche me estremeció
Bajo las ruedas de aquel maldito camión
Y no es el final, mañana comienza ésta historia en otro lugar

Nadie le dijo que la carretera, seria su fiel y fría compañera
Nadie le dijo que en la carretera, moriría destripando en la cuneta

Chuva sobre chuva, noite e dia só chuva
E eu descia para rua
No meio da avenida um amigo me via
Aonde vai, Sam?
Vou ali, depois de conto
Chuva tão sem graça, tudo que aborrece passa
Logo o sol ensolarava
Passando pela praça uma gata me mata
Aonde vai, Sam?
Vou ali depois te beijo
Um pregador me pega
Me prega o seu asco, um saco
E eu já tava no inferno
Um pregador moderno.
Blusão de couro em vez de terno
Aonde vai, filho?
Vou ali, depois me humilho
Cineclube à tarde, filme de Godard e Bergaman
Nunca mais vou esquecer
Te conheci na vida, te conheci num fim de ano
Aonde vai, Sam?
Vou ali, depois te amo
Baixo é guitarra, noite e dia só farra
Que saudade de uma missa
No adro da igreja meu amor se divertia
Aonde vai, Sam?
Vou ali e volto um dia
Aonde você vai, Sam?
Os dias são muitos
Aonde você vai, well?
Podemos ir juntos

Alegria gera alegria

Charles que deu a voz
Ao outro lado da cidade
Um grande rapper de São Paulo
Deu ao filho o nome Jorge
Invocando de novo o guerreiro
Que batuca no violão
O futuro de muitos velhos macumbeiros
De todos os butecos que Santa Clara clareia
Pelo mundo afora porque outros meninos
Virão
Com outras formas de samba
Pra melhorar nossa história
Levanta e ""vamo simbora""

Nosso charles agora é o rei mais novo

Posso chorar se ele não ganhar

Skankin' Pickle,"When I was 15 years old, I weighed only 96 lbs
Then my PE teacher told me about anabolic steroids

My body started to swell, my penis didn't look too well
After deep thought meditation, I joined the Wrestling Federation

When I step into the ring, little hulksters scream and shout
Although I'm feeling really, I can't keep my hair from falling out

Macho grabs me by the hair, throws me up into the air
There goes another 60 strands out into the screaming fans

I'm Hulk Hogan
I am losing all my hair

Skankin' Pickle,"We live in a racist world, you gotta stop hating each other
I wonder what the world thinks of one another
I know theres something wrong with me

But there's a problem in our society
You see the blacks hate the whites
And the whites hate the blacks

Or is it something else or opposite
Or maybe I am to blame for this
Wars are going on this time

To satisfy the minds of an ageless crime
And then the youth of today becomes a part of tomorrow
And tomorrow's just as worse

And it even starts to follow suit of shooting in the streets
Another rock star dies again
Boy has aids and makes news in the Enquirer
Hey there, won't you be my brother?

Skankin' Pickle,"Can't sleep once again
Too many things on my mind
I wish I could change the ways
That I have spent my time

Too lazy to get up
And help my father with the chores
I'm sure I'm not a bum
But who am I to score

But starting from 0-0
Give me the ball I say
Pride I have and always will
And I'm not a Pabu boy

Take time to think things over
Hey, that sounds okay
Even though it's four years later
And the kid has grown to stay

Make no mistakes
I understand there comes a time
To move along in some way
And make ends meet with mom

Until that day, need I say
""Don't worry ‘bout me""
I will be fine you see
And I am not a Pabu boy

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,

Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin

Hello, hello, hello
Hooray, hooray, hooray
I am here to interrupt your regular program
So hey man now don't you touch that dial
Unless we step in single file  
Keep it pretty slowly
Cause you know I like to focus on the ease 
And you can call me Skee if you please
So come on in, come on in 
Come in and give a pound mix and mingle with your friends 
Or just have a drink or just sit down
Get up stand up come on throw your hands up
If ya girl is throwin fronts then your brothers keep your chin up
Be cool with the flexin she's in the mood for sexin
You could pop the question but that's just my suggestion
And when the mood is right we can switch it off to candle light
But hold on to your girls cause if you don't well then I might
I know that you just might be in the mood-a 
To want to shoot a spark into the dark 
But this is just a start

Thinkin back black yo I could remember that high school flame
Now was it Nikki or Lorraine yo what was her name
Anyway she was so cute that back at school I tried to rock it
But she often put her purse to any brothers tryin to knock it
So stop it to get with I got with 
But what's this was honey just fakin it that kept me from my ducats 
Now the rain has gone I can clearly see
What was we enemies?
Not for long alone is what she wants to be
But what am I to do, what am I do to?
What would you do if you were in the same shoes?
With a bunch of bad news from my hoodrat
Sorry but I gotta scatter I'm movin from the East to the West
So please say God Bless and oh yes see I miss her very much
I wish that I could give her my number so that she could stay in touch
I wonder if she remembers me and what went on 
And if she does not understand word is born I'ma keep holdin on

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
(I'ma keep holdin' on)
I'll keep holdin' on

Well hello my honey ?dips?
See I'm back from my trip
All the letters you wrote I kept
Do you remember when I left?
I said, ""I'm leavin on the next plane 
Don't know when I'll be back again"" 
Kiss me, smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go my little trick-a-dee
Cause life is what you make as we take it as reality
Now we're reunited and it feels so good
You know were reunited and it feels so good
Through the centuries of time heal the rhymes and unwind
Melodies flowin swift with the jazz fill
Kill the lights move in closer to your loved ones 
Baby hold em tight like tomorrow never comes
Gaze into the eyes sympathise not the sympathy
Me and Mrs Jones got a marriage going on understand me
Everything is dandy so what can be wrong 
And if you now know the song then sing along

Yeah, this is not the diddy cause the diddy's dumb, dumb
Now I'm checkin out the sounds of the phat jazz drum
The horns and the samples with the bass and the boom
When added all together it's a phat jazz tune
Listen examine this carefully you can even dance to the beat 
Or chill and have a seat or choke of the smoke of a cactus tree
As I'm steady pumpin sounds out my NBC
With the natural ability to make you want to get down
And maybe slap five to everyone around 
So pass me a drink stop and let me think
About the sounds of the street - The Funkadella Beat
So go and get your friends and strap yourselves in  
For the journey's of your life the saga now begins
3, 2, 1 contact we have lift off right?
So I'm about to take flight and this is how it sounds 

(Skee-Lo)
I freak the funk on the microphone check it baby 1, 2
Cause I got the skills and I thought that maybe you knew 
That I can be chilled and have a good time
So when you see me - make sure you throw up your peace signs
Recline, let your mind be free
Till the break of dawn at a club I'll be
So you know to put your dirty hands up in the air 
And wave em side to side like you just don't care, yeah
Sister's in the back with the afro's 
And the brothers in the corner with the jerboas
And if you haters start trouble you know where to go 
And now you're tuned in to the sounds of the Skee-Lo
I take the stage and your aid to another fella emcee
Produce tracks is not whack with sounds from my MP
3, 2, 1 contact we have lift off right?  
And so I'm about to take flight and this is how it sounds

Beats they be infinite and phatter than the pork
The sounds can be heard from Cali to New York
Forget about your troubles forget about your blues 
Cause jazz is alive so go and spread the news 
And once the news is heard then others can relate 
Maybe find the phattest samples from the back of the crates
So chill cool with the breeze microphone check one, two to the three
Break down doors dance on floors and have your fun 
Cause the party doesn't stop till the morning comes 
Yeah, now I can feel the beats so I'ma kick back for a second
Have a seat yo and this is how it sounds

I don't need your sympathy your misery is drivin me insane
You got your hands out but I refrain 
From givin you a pound you bloody hound
You better take heed to cause I don't need you to hang around 
Now you wasn't cool ever since back when I got jumped
You played the punk and ran a sprint 
See one of us is trippin but I was just concerned 
At the time I lost my wallet 
and you found it stole my money then returned it 
You used to claim in front of people we were next of kin 
I never knew that you were sleepin with my girlfriend
And if I did I would've bashed you maybe thrashed you
I never asked you homie tell me is it true 
Because I knew you were up to no good
Spreadin rumours on me in the neighbourhood 
Yeah, so let me bring this to my point
We ain't friends, we ain't homies and we never shared a joint

I remember girls in college who was never ever
Among these beautiful women was my favourite name Venetta
Pain, love and agony she's all of the above
I keep thinkin to myself ""Oh I don't want to fall in love""
But oh Venetta I read your letter
And it gets better as I read on down the lines but in my mind 
I cannot find out why you want to diss me 
Getting me to fall in love with you and just to say you can't be with me 
(You ain't down)
You're messin with my head and although it seems
Your heart is darker than the night so I'm prepared to use my high beams 
You had me doin things silly things 
Sharin with you my feelings and in the meantime you was killin 
Me softly hey women get off me you know you lost me
Hey that's what you get for actin flossy 
You caused me to open up my eyes and look around 
I see that we ain't friends, we ain't lovers we ain't homies baby

This is dedicated to the kids who ain't crew 
You ain't never been down so homie ain't no pounds for you 
You'll never know me so don't you try to show me
We can be friends you can now but somehow you did back then
Just to be down with me you don't need a change of heart
Just change your life and your identity 
Cause everybody's on my jock tryin to flag me down
When I come around the block 
It's all the same the only thing that's changed is
You used to call me puff but now you call me by name
You and your friends get no love, sympathy or pain
If I gave you the chance then you would diss me again
Is it fortune and fame that you persist to be around?
I don't want to see a smile I don't want to see a frown
So now you know that's how it was and that's how it is
By the way stay out of my biz
Cause homie you ain't down

Last year when I went home, got in my car and got gone
Hit the streets and shot on, 18 years since I'm gone
Call my homie Jerome, spoke to his brother Tyrome
Who seemed a little distant cause my calls were not persistent
He say Rome went to prison for resistin' arrest
And mamma had a problem wit her chest, what, cardiac arrest
I was hurt and ain't even been here a week
And after all that bad news I couldn't speak
And my toes went weak and my legs went numb
It gets crazy in the streets tryin' to live wit no funds
Don't cheat you don't eat, your case you can't beat
Public defenders is there to make the deals go sweet
For the prosecution it's like an execution
But you can make it if you're patient and avoid confusion
It took a while for me to learn this and stay on my feet
But if this rappin' don't happen for me I'm goin' back to the streets

Before the day that I blew up back when I grew up
Back when I had a shag chewin' gum wearin' chucks
Before I even thought about makin' the big bucks
I was busy throwin' rocks at cars and dump trucks
Even now I can hear her mamma callin' my full name
Me and uncle Joe would be watchin' the Bulls game
Before they had Jordan when all you needed was change
To get yourself some candy, some pickles and sugar canes
Even then I could feel the streets movin' all through
My veins and everything I seen absorbed in my brain
I'm not afraid to tell it my brother I'm not ashamed
You take a look at me now and look at where I came
Robert Taylor, 4500 on State Street in Chicago
Where most of the hoodsters and thugs be
If it hadn't of been for all the people that loved me
And for god's grace life get cruel and ugly in the streets

It's all good
But people don't, got it misunderstood, street code is
Simply you stick to your own hood
Stay in your own woods and chop your own tree
And if something jumps off pretend you didn't see
Keep your mouth shut up, for you get knocked up
Ain't no since in tryin' to get somebody else locked up
And that's the truth
That's why I send messages to the youth
Hope the lord makes a way out
Forget the gang and stay out
Cause everybody wants to live in the sunshine
If not right now at least at one time
Look back in your mind remember you was a kid
Remember before you grew up how innocent you lived
From big wheels to big thrills and big heights
From innocent to killin' your brother for Air Nikes
And I can't believe that none of these things don't
Strike y'all brothers in the head like this ain't right

And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown
And any time a tiny face will show itself cause waiting's almost over

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

I won't beg you to stay with me

Creating the sound, there's still no love for me,
Somebody rescue me,
Just rescue me,
Rescue me,
Rescue me",Rescue Me [Ruff Loaderz Mix]
Skepta,"I noticed when I walked in
The room went dark
Somebody better call the police
There's a guy here with no heart
He said he goes by the name of Skepta
He's on a warpath
And he said if anybody touches the crown
He's gonna tear them apart
And a grime MC was telling me
I kill them and I put them in a cemetery
And if anybody thinks they're sick in the head
Then I'm going to rip him to shreds live on the stage like Jeremy
I'm going in for the kill
I wouldn't stop even if I had a punctured wheel
Got no time for the war with will
Squash that beef like a Forman grill
I got a lot of mandem looking out for me
The ladies, they go wild for me
Back to the front, left to the right
And everybody up in the balcony
You can tell by my accent that I'm straight out of London city
Like Wiley
Like Dizzee
Like Tinie
Like Trippy
Let's get busy, I was in forth now I'm in fifth
Man wished I was in port looking at a sixth
Instead I'm on tour
I fxck off the stage, encore
Excuse my French, bonjour
Je m'appelle Skepta AKA Daniel Son
If I'm on the bill at two
Then the party starts at about half past one

I'm a grime MC and I won't change,
Doing it again, doing it my own way
I'm a grime MC and I won't change,
Doing it again, doing it my own way
I'm a grime MC and I won't change,
Doing it again, doing it my own way
And I might recycle the bar
Because my material is too good to throw away
Doing it again, they tried to stop me but I'm doing it again
Skepta, yeah I'm doing it again
Boy Better Know yeah I'm doing it again
I'm, I'm doing it again
They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again
Skepta, yeah I'm doing it again
Boy Better Know I'm doing it again.

All because of the grime bars I'm spitting
MC's are talking about quitting
25 mobiles ringing, majors bidding
Boy Better Know chase ringing
I've walked with the best
2 fingers up to the west
Big S tattooed on my chest
Microphone champion no contest
A lot of man never though I would get to say my piece
Can't believe the singles I release
I climbed up the chart at light speed
And I'm made of myrrh I forget about Sajid
If it costs to be the boss
I pay full price
And I can show you my receipt
Scars on my body from wars in the street
Pain in my left arm
And I can't sleep
So I'm sitting up praying for success to come a little sooner
I never suck up to no-one
I'm not a hoover
I come to fxck up the game like a sore looser
The way I turn heads
You would have thought that this was a reverse parking manoeuvre
And when you're listening to Boy Better Know,
You're listening to the sound of the future
I keep my circle tight
And the question everyone's asking is, ""Who are you? ""
So I gotta put these squares in the right place like a Rubiks cube
I'm a solider, what have you been through?
You and your stupid crew
Better remember when you're talking to a chart topper
You're talking to the lord of the mic part 2

SN1 on my tee again, my black trousers D&G again
Looking like a G again
That's right it's me again
My big .45's gotta flea in 'em
Think I've only got one Mac, got three of 'em
Then you won't see me again
Time to get the white in and the B again
Just got some high grades from Vesra
I'm a real G so I gotta little extra
I like hot girls 'cause I'm extra
Thought about my lighty then I text her
Impressed her, thinks I'm on shit 'cause I'm doing it with Skepta
Take off your whole head top, Hannibal Lecter
Black director, shoot up shit then I cut in the Vectra
Orange bud weed lookin' nectar
Strap a big boy spliff sotum nester
Had to breeze up to Chester
Got a new flake link, gotta tester
Ooohh, potent white girl, so I pressed her
Hugh Hefner, pitch niggas like Scarface did Hector
Breeze in there like car chase with feds cah it's looking like them Jakes wanna get us
I'm the best 'cause I ain't in the rap game were the best bruv
We got the best slugs, so come against us

Makes you wanna lick out a cartridge
Look out you bastards
We push out the hard shit

Yo, this might sound a bit cheeky but I don't even try fam I make it look easy, naturally greazy
Me and Giggs run up and take all the gold coins like Mario and Luigi
You wanna say something, say it when you see me
Don't phone me, save your credit
'Cause if you can't tell me what happens after you die I don't wanna hear it
You ain't half a gangster, nowhere near it
Meridian, that's my murdering force
Giggs beat the skeng in South, I heard it in North
And hate me, Boy Better Know t-shirts and SN1 wear for the whole world to endorse, course
North's up in this bitch
I don't know what you heard but you can't take the piss
If you saw what the kick back done to my wrist
You would have never put my name on your murder list
Fam if you interrupt the vibe that I'm in then I ride ride ride with my ting
So fuck them niggas, everyday I'm surrounded by killers, like I was on a lifers wing
See I'm a cool brudda with a heart of the wickedest
Violate me I squeeze this 'til it finishes
Then I switch clips like Hollowman switches chicks
Rinse the machine like boom bye bye, I call that Buju Banton
Light up your head like a lantern
Boy Better Know standard
""Look Out"", that's the anthem
Ask all the mandem, out here in the grime scene I'm the champion
Until I get a mansion, I'mma keep murdering spitters at random

This is the hard shit
Makes you wanna lick out a cartridge
Look out you bastards
We push out the hard shit

Haha, what they gonna say now?

We can write at home, but we wanna write in the studio and make it look good
You get me?

Skepta,"Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this Amnesia

Skepta, Charts
Last night was sick
Oh what a city I lost my phone though oh what a pity
When I woke up I found a note that said
Sorry I had to go ily
I looked around this can't be real
'Cause I don't recognize this
Then I saw the minibar and I was like rar
Somebody terrorized it

Not even a bottle of water
Make it worse this room was hotter than a sauna
So I jumped up got ready.
Went downstairs to the hotel lobby
Man are like swear down you're a mad man skeppy
I must have had one to many
'Cause I can't remember anything
After the two Jägermeisters and a bottle of Henny

Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this Amnesia

Who you trying to diss?
Who did you fight with?
Who did you kiss?
Who did you dance with?
Who did you lits?
Aw man, you were a myth

I remember walking in blinded by the lights
Look left, look right
Saw two men that I don't like
But I already lit up the room when I walked in
No need for fireworks tonight
Unless it's on the side of a bottle
And I'm only here for one night on the high
So I'm trying to find me a model
We circled the party once
Nothing, twice
Dead third time around I saw a girl I tuck into bed
Two minutes later, I'm at the bar
Doing shots of Jäger
That's when I blacked out
Anything after that's all a myth
Like Lorrie Ager, major

Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this amnesia

Who you trying to diss?
Who did you fight with?
Who did you kiss?
Who did you dance with?
Who did you lits?
Aw man, you were a myth!

We had one drink, two drink, three drink four
Had one too many, now you're laying on the floor
One drink, two drink, three drink, four
Had one too many, now you're laying on the floor

You lost your phone
You lost your friends
Now here comes that classic line
I'm never drinking again
Thought you were casually drinking
But you were actually binging
Woke up somewhere you've never been to in your whole life and now your thinking

Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this Amnesia

Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this amnesia",Amnesia
Skepta,"They say ""Skepta, you must get loads of girls""
The music's picked up now
Tell em like J2k, nah, it's all switched up now
She thinks that if she talks to me they'll call
Her a groupie behind her back now
So she stands far but close enough for her pictures
To have me in the background
I'm kinda used to it now
They say it's all part and parcel
And if it's this much for me
Imagine what's it's like for Curtis and Marshall
I wanna go hard
But my body keeps telling me to take it easy
So I sit here watching a DVD logo bounce around the TV
My life ended ages ago, now it's all a dream
Sitting here, thinking how this thing all started
From What D'Ya Mean, What D'Ya Mean
Now that I'm getting that paper I heard a couple man want me dead
So I went out bought a Gucci hat and put money on my own head
I forever hear people talking like I don't know about street
Fake gangstas must think I spent my music money on chocolate and sweets
You're looking for beef in London? Nah it's not hard to find it
But I'm not scared of a gun, it's all about the man behind it

You wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
This famous life make people wanna wish they were 6 feet under
But not me
See when I made it big
I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger
Truss

Sometimes I think that I think too much
I start thinking about thinking
Then I start to get paranoid
I think my windows need tinting
They say why work all this time
To get famous Joseph
Just to wear sunglasses
Cause you don't wanna get noticed
Once in a while I take em off
And I'm like ""arrr, that's too bright""
Because I sleep all day then I wake up at night
Then I phone my girl, see if she wants to link
She said she got work in the morning
So what do I do, I go out for a drink
I spend all my time in clubs
It's starting to feel like home
I don't wanna sit in the VIP but sometimes I just wanna be left alone
I hate when I'm in a bad mood and I see all my supporters vibes'n
And I apologies to anyone I've taking a pic with when I weren't smiling
They say ""don't you remember me I met you at Party In The Park""
Babe, I can't even where I parked my car in the car park
Now she hates me and every time she hears my song she's changing the station
I swear the human brain weren't designed to deal with all this information

You still wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
This famous life can make some people wish they were 6 feet under
But not me
You see when I made it big
I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger
Truss

Listen tomorrow isn't promised to us so
You have to enjoy today
Cause the game is like a box of roses
Cause when they're done with the chocolate
The wrapper gets thrown away
I said the wrapper gets thrown away

When you're shooting for your targets
And it's making you a target
You die before you live, I wish you warned me when I started
We're going full hearted, R.I.P the half wits
Cause now we're 6 feet under the top spot fuck a casket
Bastards, don't we make the lifestyle look appealing
Independent names and chains
Skepta are we dreaming?
Nobody could season, this track couldn't reach him
Cause now I'm on the other side of that glass ceiling
The underdogs are off the leash
Eh Joseph, pass the muzzles and the leads
The games full of demons, let's get this arm house on
Everyone wants handouts but I ain't stretch Armstrong
We've come so far as emcee's
Round of applause or bust it off just make it clap please
I'm so past just trying to be the favourite
You're nobody until you got some haters
But you still wanna make it BIG!

You wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

There weren't one ticket left not even a chair
I should send you a postcard, I wish you were here
I wish you could see, I wish you could hear
I make 'em scream
When I come true with the rest of the team
I get it pop-in mainstream, still I'm the best in the scene
So I can understand why everybody wants to do it like me
No you don't do it like me
Nah, no we ain't the same
You're never gonna do it I'm doin' it again
Boy Better Know, were moving too fast
You better move into a different lane
Oh what a shame
They though I weren't gonna bust, then I came
Took off the condom, made it rain
Left my stain all over the game
And these wanna be's wanna be me
They disrespect me then they beg me for a Re-tweet
Then we see them on the camera, walking, talking trynna do it like me
No you don't do it like me

Skepta I got the UK buzzing like a vibrator
Now my paper's looking higher than a sky scraper
Chipmunk told me don't watch no face
I'll never leave home without my pencil case
24/7 I stay with my eraser
Put it up in the sky, nice and high, wave it side to side
Screaming rub e'm out, rub e'm out

But you man are blowing off
Blad, you're blowing out

But you're constipated, your sh*t ain't coming out

MC's don't wanna see me on the scene I take it old school like
Nah rude boy, what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean you fool
Go on then, go on then draw for the tool
Think that you're hard but you're soft like wool
I will lick a man in the jaw side with a stool
I'm a real bad boy but I still look cool
White gold chains and a' I start drool
But they can't jack me becuz I'm not Ja rule
Nah rude boy what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean
I was born on September the 19th, don't care about February 14th
Pay me for my 16th before I start acting like it's Friday the 13th
With two black gloves and balaclava

Pay me for my halfa

People here are starting to hear you as the King of grime 
because you're the one person that has stuck by this genre of music,
I'm the, I'm the guy that we love this music I love grime world.

Blowin up shh like a bomb in iraq
Diddys in white I'm in all black
It's about to get real grimey
So somebody say dj pull up the track
Ow shut this down
You ain't heard nothing like this since pow!
You ain't heard nothing like this so god forgive me
Fore I buss my ting right now
Wow I blow my own trumpet
And if you don't like it lump it
I'm a uk badboy and just for the record I like tea
But I don't like crumpets
Dirty money and boy better know together
That's crazy as hell
Me and diddy got both hands on the big red button
Just say the word and we'll shut down the world

This is the grime remix
Hello good morning
Let's go
Hello good morning
Know you been waiting
For it
Hey yo skepta

Walked into the club and I got two sexy girls on each side
Money in the bank but still I got to stay on my grind

Man better mention me when they talk about grime
And they told me to shut this down I'm a do it tonight
I'm a do it tonight
It's skepta I'm that guy
And I'm d-I-d-d-y
Boy better know till I die
And you can't see me I'm way too fly
Chicks stop and stare when I roll by
Hate me and I don't know why
Cause I spent half my life in the sky
And I buy the things that you wanna buy yeah
Take that come on don't stop talk to em girl
So hot that I bring the shit

Spending dirty money everywhere go from the 504 new york to London

Skepta,"See I used to think like you
So to diss you wouldn't be fair
But at the same time if I listen to what you tell me I wouldn't be here
Shit turns to gold when I touch it
So me looking at youtube comments is counter-productive
Cause none of that criticism is constructive
So I switch off the mac like fuck this
You're never gonna see me switchin'
Another twitter account with no pic, 10 followers, 
Following everybody he's dissing
I found myself now I'm missing
They love the grime flow I'm spitting
I took it to the chart now they're listening
I can't wait till I'm on tour I'm itchin'
Make some noise
Somebody tell Will Smith I am Legend
What dya know about looking in the fridge 
And all you can see is a white light like heaven
When I was young I used to beg mum 
For some money to buy a birthday present
And now parents want to book me for a sweet 16
I'm a birthday present

They didn't want to rate me
But all my supporters came together and saved me
Tears in my eyes
Head high, pointing to the sky
Screaming nobody made me, nobody made me

Put your hands in the air
For the grime MC of the year
Some say I came out of nowhere
Little d'they know it's been a four year nightmare
Running around with no runner
Had to pay for my own radio plugger
Watch'd everybody eating
While I sat there with no bread, no butter
I told myself I gotta do this
Whatever the weather I get through this
Long as I keep making the hits
My distributors gotta move those units
So I never gave up hoping, naa
Forget crying and sulking
They said I was too grimey
Now me and P. Diddy on the iChat laughing and joking
Make some noise
And I hope all you A and R's heard that
I got so much more that I wanna say
But I'm looking foward I can't turn back
Remember it's boy better know all year from October to September
We built this ourselves so the only man that can ever knock me down is Skepta

I never have a dream when I go to sleep at night
My dream begins when I walk outside
Now I'm on stage and I feel like I'm looking through Michael Jacksons eyes
Stories, rumours and accusations
So I gotta stay self conscious of my hand gestures
Before they call me a Mason or say that I'm working with Satan
But even a blind man could see
I would never sell my soul for the P
When you're looking at Skepta, you're looking at grime
So the only thing I gotta stay true to is me
I don't need a helping hand
Stand up tall, I'm my own man
Find me on the tallest building in the country singing as loud as I can

I-I feel so alive, so alive
(S-K-E-P-T-A)
Got my two feet on the ground
But it feels like I'm in the sky
It's time to enjoy the sun
'Cause we made it through the rain
Put your hands up in the sky
Like you're tryna touch a plane
I-I feel so alive, so alive

(Boy Better Know oh-oh, yeah)

Shit what have I done
Raa, everyone singing along to my bars man
Went triple platinum, see me I'm trying to do what Elvis done
And the stage is way too big for me
Labels never thought this guy from the ghetto could make all these girls sing for me
Nana, nana, nana, na ee
I got a big NANA chain hanging down to my navel
Tell the bartender ""take a fat bottle of champagne to Polydor's table""
Big men acting like school kids
Say there gonna run up on me with a full clip
So I pull down the two flaps on my hat
'Cause I didn't want to hear that bullshit

I-I feel so alive, so alive
(D-A-Double P-to-the-Z)
Got my two feet on the ground
But it feels like I'm in the sky
It's time to enjoy the sun
'Cause we made it through the rain
Put your hands up in the sky
Like you're tryna touch a plane
I-I feel so alive, so alive (nana, nana, nana, na ee)

It's time to get dark, blacker than Cilla
Fazer aka 6 figure nigga
Man said I got robbed for my chain
Until I put a picture on Skepta's twitter
When I go to the Gucci store I dress rags
Security think that I ain't gonna buy shit
Then I pull out my card, swipe it, bowl out with 20 bags
If I like them, cop them
Fuck the hater, can't stop them
Mc's wanna diss N-Dubz, but they can't get a top twenty let alone a top ten
So if it weren't for the fans
I woulda had a haters blood on my hands
I'm a mastermind behind the keyboard
So I'm a carry on stacking up these grands

I-I feel so alive, so alive
(D-A-Double P-to-the-Z)
Got my two feet on the ground
But it feels like I'm in the sky
It's time to enjoy the sun
'Cause we made it through the rain

Everybody doing covers of American beats

Then it all sounds like Rick Ross to me

Fuck that nigga SMD

Dunno who you're pretending to be
I don't care what gun you bang
I don't care what drug you sell

Because I got a manager, a DJ
7 MC's and five producers on my label

Better bring something to the table

Too many man come in the game for two minutes
Shoot two videos, spit two lyrics
Now all of a sudden their names getting mentioned
In the same sentence as mine by the critics
What has this world come to
Man better control Z and undo
But all thanks to the love and support
I'm gassed up standing out the sun roof
And I'm screaming BBK BBK
None of them flex like BBK
And if I ever see your girl on the street
Then I'mma get arrested for TDA
'Cause she knows I do it and it's real
And I don't give a shit who's got a deal
'Cause if the game was a tray full of ice cubes
I'm the coldest and the hardest still

They thought the ""All Over The House"" video would crush me
Last week I did five shows in five different countries
The supports have still got love for me
Middle finger to the media
Hypocrites can't touch me
I'll be in Dubai eating in Nobu
Word to Dumi and T this food tastes lovely
I walk from White Hart lane to the flats opposite Tottenham police station
Payed subs to go on the radio station
Left radio jumped on the train to Leytonstone
Linked Murkle Man to make some more grime in the basement
Lemme show you bout dedication
Suffering from Underdog Psychosis tryna stay alive
Riding around on a bike
Blade long enough to go to jail for, more dots on me than a dice
The olders had the chips and the Big Macs
But didn't wanna let me have a bite
So it was just me, my cats and the foxes roaming the streets at night
Felt like I was wasting life
Put down the cling film and picked up the mic
For one whole year never got music money or money off white
But I know that Rome weren't built in a day
Looked at he end of the tunnel and saw light
Now me and Jme, top 30, back to back on the iTunes site, mental

Too many man come in the game for two minutes
Shoot two videos, spit two lyrics

Sitting in Meridian playing Alien Trilogy
Still I had the ladies feeling my masculinity
Black Bill Clinton linking Monica and Hillary

She's undressing me with her eyes, she's stripping me
X-rated video, I did it deliberately
These little newspapers thought they got rid of me
But I was in the Coliseum in Italy
Fresh shirt, iced out, Hickory Dickory
Pretty lookin' wife with a swag on infinity

Took her back to the room for some intimacy

Niggas ain't got GCSEs still don't wanna work for a minimum wage

Livin' a life of the young and the gifted
In the studio, run out of drink, all we got is some weed and biscuits
I'm supposed to be writing
Instead I'm daydreaming about doggy-styling Kate Winslet
Snap out of the dream
Pass me the lighter let me light up the green
A million words in my head
Tryna think about punchlines that I haven't already said
I wanna write a diss track but my enemies are already dead
I only smoke one spliff but my eyes are already red
I'll be waiting 'til the cows come home
For man to offer me a biscuit cos I don't normally beg
Open up the pizza box we got earlier but it's full of crust and corn
We've been here so long

Discharge myself from the hospital
Fuck the constable
Go home and deal with the beef like sunday roast on a plate
See I grew up in London
Where the olders talk, but the youngers ain't listening
I was given dirty looks by the priest at my christening
No food in the kitchen
Two brothers, one sister'n
Right now you're listening to the oldest sibling
And I get so much cake I might change my surname to Kipling
All the mandem raise your glasses again
Here's to another year at the top of the game
Ah we just can't stop toasting
Said I'll be a big MC by end of school term and they thought I was joking
Now I got 15 girls in my bed and each and every one of them's roasting

She told me it's just a little bit of powder so I look better in HD
I saw the video, I had so much make-up I didn't even look like me
So now it's just me, myself and the camera, 1080p
She saw the video fullscreen on YouTube, now she wants to fuck with a G
Told me she'd come into my house in a long coat with nothing underneath
I would love you more if you brought me a packet of Rizla and something to eat
Please, keep it simple don't act like a leech
I don't wanna hear your ""I'm not a groupie, tell me your real name"" speech
My real name is Skepta and I do this for my niggas that breach
I do this for the girl with green eyes sunbathing topless on a beach
I tell an A&R come check me if you wanna talk about making an anthem
You wanna talk label politics, go and check David Cameron
'Cause if success is judged by chart positions and riches
I'll put the mic down and leave my legacy to reign on all these bitches

Now every day's like Saturday
Surrounded by stars
Come chill with the constellation

And killed the conversation
Sometimes I've gotta scratch my head
Like big man ting on a level
Only my mum and dad call me Junior
What makes you so special?
No Rolex timepiece
No Hublot kettle

Put the foot to the pedal like

Yeah, I don't care about VIP
I've got very important places to be
While I'm asleep, I'm making a beat
Girls in the house getting naked for me
What I'm tryna say is basically
Never get a joke man mistaken for me
Corn on the curb if a man diss me
My niggas got the biscuits in T
Santa Claus used to miss my house
So I decorated my own Christmas tree
Ring man's phone if he think's it's beef
What do you mean, ""who is this, blud?"" It's me

Don't get it twisted 'cause I don't beef online

You don't mind if my friends introduce themselves, do you Leroy? 
Then let the games begin!

Ha! Back up in the booth and my ""V"" is for Vendetta
Fuck the last rhyme, to tell you the truth I got 10 better
I bend letters over 'til they look like ""n's""
And then offend so many men with them, they look like fems
I'm a feminine rebel, forever cleverer than your shit
Never be level with niggas' shit, my flow can float bitch
Figure out the dosage to administer vaccines
Sickness I invoke in close considered the Black Jean
It's Blakroc, it's Blacksmith
Miss Grae and I'm back, bitch
Hulk-smash harass a motherfucker most passionate 
Fashion plate, magistrate
Fascinating lady, grab your Vaseline and masturbate
Emasculate your manhood, possibly damn good
Dismantle all your posse turn them pussy with tan hoods
Don't push me, I don't land good
Liable to fly up off the handle like a pan would
And ""swoosh,"" hit. Mrs. Woods

Salt rivers flowing out my eyeballs
Pierced side, broke legs, bearing my cross
The old heads told me life wasn't a game
But mine steady feeling like pinball, dodgeball
Chasing freedom, establish a kingdom
And build a stone castle out of thinwall, drywall
I'm a keep going 'til God call or the sky fall
Or they blast me on a grassy knoll and try to blame Oswald
Average Joe Blow, mastering my mojo
Cinder block, karate chop
Practice in the dojo (uh)
If it's so-so, I'll probably be a no show
Shootin' the willy bobo out on Nostrand with the po' folks (uh)
Black dragon rap, flames out the nostrils
From Crown Fried to Roscoe's I'm spreading the gospel
I overcame like the Saints done the Falcons
Like Hoover did to Malcolm

Poison with the darts

Lies the wounded, the shattered remains of love betrayed
And the innocence of a child is bought and sold
In the name of the damned

How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true

Tell me when a kiss of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear of running unto you
Please let there be light

All the precious times have been put to rest again
And the smile of the dawn
Brings tainted lust singing my requiem
Can I face the day when I'm tortured in my trust
And watch the crystallize
While my salvation it crumbles to dust

Why can't I steer the ship before it hits the storm
I've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shore

And when you needed me I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes

Wished ever after would be like this
You said I love you babe, without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights through every endless day

But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

But nothing else could ever take you away

Skillet,"Walk this world alone try to stay on my feet

Sometimes crawl, fall, but I stand up cause I'm afraid to sleep
And open my eyes to a new day, with all new problems 4. and all new pain
All the faces are filled with so much anger
Losing our dignity and hope from fear of danger
After all the wars, after settling the scores, at the break of dawn we will be deaf to the answers

There's so much bigotry, misunderstanding and fear
With eyes squinted and fists clinched we reach out for what is dear
We want it we want
We want a reason to live

We're on a pilgrimage
A crusade for hope
'Cause in our hearts and minds and souls we know
We need it we need
We need more than this

Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by looking for angels

Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels

So many nations with so many hungry people
So many homeless scrounging around for dirty needles
On the rise, teen suicide, when we will realize
We've been desensitized by the lies of the world

We're oppressed and impressed by the greedy
Whose hands squeeze the life out of the needy
When will we learn that wars, threats,
And regrets are the cause and effect of living in fear

Who can help protect the innocence of our children
Stolen on the internet with images they can't forget
We want it we want
We want a reason to live

We represent a generation that wants to turn back a nation
To let love be our light and salvation
We need it we need

We need more than this
I became a savior to some kids I'll never meet
Sent a check in the mail to buy them something to eat
What will you do to make a difference, to make a change?

What will you do to help someone along the way?
Just a touch, a smile as you turn the other cheek
Pray for your enemies, humble yourself, love's staring back at me
In the midst of the most painful faces
Angels show up in the strangest of places",Looking for Angels
Skillet,"The walls between
You and I

Always pushing us apart nothing left but scars fight after fight

The space between
Our calm and rage
Started growing shorter, disappearing slowly day after day

I was sitting there waiting in my room for you
You were waiting for me too
And it makes me wonder

The older I get
Will I get over it?
It's been way too long for the times we missed

I didn't know then it would hurt like this, but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this

The time between
Those cutting words
Built up our defenses never made no sense, it just made me hurt
Do you believe
That time heals all wounds?
It started getting better, but it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you

What was I waiting for?
I should have taken less and given you more
I should have weathered the storm
I need to say so bad
What were you waiting for?
This could have been the best we ever had

I'm just getting older
I'm not getting over you, I'm trying to
I wish it didn't hurt like this

We used to laugh
About nothing at all
It was better than going mad
From trying to solve all the problems we're going through
Forget 'em all
'Cause all those nights we would stand and never fall
Together we faced it all
Remember when we'd

Stay up late and we'd talk all night
In a dark room lit by the tv light
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive

We'd listen to the radio play all night
Didn't want to go home to another fight
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive

I remember when
We used to drive
Anywhere but here
As long as we'd forget our lives
We were so young and confused that we didn't know
To laugh or cry
Those nights were ours
They will live and never die
Together we'd stand forever
Remember when we'd

Those nights belong to us
There's nothing wrong with us

I remember when
We used to laugh
And now I wish those nights would last",Those Nights

I'm in the grass on my knees, wipe the leaves away

I got some things I need to say

I'd give up all the world to see
That little piece of heaven looking back at me
Now that it's over

And I can't live with myself today

They said it'd bring some closure to say your name
I know I'd do it all different if I had the chance
But all I got are these roses to give
And they can't help me make amends

Just another moment in your eyes
I'll see you in another life
In heaven where we never say goodbye

I can't keep it, hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain, in the world we've made

Every day you need, a bulletproof vest
To save yourself, from what you could never guess
Am I safe today?
When I step outside, in the wars we wage

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is our call
Rise and Revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise and Revolution

Unite, and Fight
To make a better life
Everybody, one for all
Sound off, this is the call

Tonight, We Rise, Rise
Tonight, We Rise, Rise
Tonight, We Rise

Like a hand grenade, thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos, trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb

And when the scars heal, the pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes
Darkness fades away
And the light shines on a brave new day

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is our call
Rise and Revolution

In a world gone mad (in a voice so sad)
Sometimes it's crazy (crazy)
To fight for what you believe
But you can't give up (no)

If you want to keep what you love (keep what you love)
Keep what you love (keep what you love)
Keep what you love

So break it down for me I can't understand
Nowadays you got more rappers than you got fuckin' fans
And man listen that's a pity
That shit wouldn't come off the shelves if a earthquake hit the city
If they ain't pullin' blunts, they pullin' triggers
I'm gettin' tired of DJ Nobody and MC New Nigga
Huh, I start cyphers for self in dark alleys
I wreck shows lovely cause I got nine personalities
I kick the real on ear woundin' tracks
Your first mistake was, ""Man niggaz from Virginia can't rap""

I put roots on MC's who try to fade these
lyrics kid please, I got the microphone disease
And I don't joke when it's time to go to work
Wack MC's play like Pee Wee Herman and get jerked
In the cypha, Mad Skillz gets hyper
More heads show up, and now the shit's gettin tighter
Huh, I find it hard to breathe, bassline strummin
Money it's gettin hot but the lyrics keep - comin
Feel like I'm trapped inside my mother's womb
Adrenaline's flowin - it's bound to be a battle sound
Peep it - this is our secret garden
Niggaz are representin and nuff heads are noddin
on the corners, without the mics
Inside the clubs, without the spotlight
Packed in tight like we were all doin a bid
Fuck where you're from, it's time to shoot your lyrics kid
Yo flip the script if you're wack time will tell
Aww shit, my man lit up the L
So you go for yours, I'ma go for mine
Rapper after rapper, rhyme after rhyme
Hardcore punchlines and then come the riddles
It's like gettin high when I'm standin in the middle
So freestyle fanatics and you bad-ass writers
Your shit ain't real unless it's real in the cypha, uhh

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
On the corners, brothers bob their heads
From the baldies, and the natty dreads (doin time in the cypha)

Minus the static, and some batteries for your radio, cause yo
Skills are vital if you enter
I seen niggaz lose titles just for standin in the, center
Can you feel it?  Can you feel the vibes?
It looks like we beefin to them people walkin, by
The feel is real and ain't nobody fake
So go acapella while my man flips the, tape
I close my eyes and think for a while

Yeah, who's next to flex?  Yeah, you know the deal

Keep shit funky with the funky sensations
So step up kid, c'mon kid step up front
And peep out my man while he's rhymin with the blunt (true)
Some kids bring the funk, some kids bring the dissin
Some kids are just wack (right) but everybody's listenin
Yeah you gotta give respect money when respect is due
Fuck the bullshit - in the cypha, shit is true
The rhymes get spit and the 40's get tapped
Some niggaz don't have jack, some niggaz got contracts

Their crews became victim of the body-snatchin dread
The world is now mine, the world belongs to me
I carefully planned the extinction of all wack MC's
Now innocents must prepare for my slaughter
My style will inherit the world, just like water
Cover it like sauce, think about who lost
Niggaz minds was the reason for the MC holocaust
I'll be the first to admit, I'm on some next shit
Two rappers stepped up and left bullemic, and anorexic
I told humans I'd conquer and bomb shit
Now I stand alone and take care of my continents
A&R's used to ignore me (yep) realized I was nice
Now it's no one left here to write my life story
Ninety-five rappers shelled like pearls
Hit by genocide, I inherited the world

Slit my own wrists, and bleedin out microphones
Consider me the MC who lives forever
Rainin hemlock on niggaz, yes, the God of the weather
The end of time as you know it without a shotty
In the simple game of freeze tag, I touched EVERYBODY
Man's worst creation like the bomb
Just exist in life form, then I'm leavin town tomorrow
If I hadn't done it, the world wouldn't be clean
Now I memorize rhymes, work on my time machine
Nothin shall breathe, or be conceived
They shoulda known, now it's on and the world's on it's knees
I feel relieved, free from their directions
Now I battle my reflection, ask rhetorical questions (uh-huh)
My actions, they might make mortals earl
I won't have that problem, I inherited the world

Now put thought to the word one
Cause now I got Mad time to think about what I done
It's too quiet here, I'm losin my mentality
I'm actually alone and I'm startin to see reality
No more hip-hop -- what was I thinkin of?
No more fat tracks and no family to love
No incidents makin black people tighter
No more real MC's doin time in the cypher
No wreckin shows, no more gettin biz
I fantasize and hear voices sayin, ""Yo that shit was fat kid""
Nothin to look forward to, day after day
So why write rhymes - who's gonna hear what I have to say?
And if I do, who's gonna appreciate it?
Humanity terminated, I'm alone and I hate it
I lost it all, my crew and my girl

like the ground was covered with thumbtacks
I'm in your face like mace, take a taste
Make a crowd vibrate, like a device on my waist
Skillz Mad, will he be bad?  Ask your dad
Don't front, he know about the skills that I had
Or should I say got cause my mic still hot
Back up it's Shakwan I'm lettin off verb shots
I take MC's, wake 'em up out they sleep
Pour ammonia in they face, slap 'em with some microphone techniques
After that, niggaz retire, cause I'm iller
and my lyrics are thicker than Richard Pryor
One time for my crew, two times for the fam
Givin crews sun tans, make way for the jam

[Chorus]
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yo you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Money you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yeah you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam

[Mad Skillz]
Yeah, the jam has arrived so all that garbage can walk
before I personally interact with that ass like Box Talk
So pass the steel when I flex on the reels
You know the deal that nigga Skillz be up in dips like Massengil
douche, ass toosh, who get loose
Funk money times five gettin live call a truce
From Compton to Maine I tear, niggaz out the frame
I don't battle I show niggaz how to play the cryin game
Like last November, when your man got dismembered
It was me I ate his meat, and it lasted through the winter
So enter, cause yo I been, bombin since
ninety-one when I started destroyin MC's confidence
So peace, to the real MC's
Kalonji the Mindbenda and my man Lonnie be	
Javon, Little Rock, Big Street my man
Fuckin 'round with Skillz you get caught up in the jam

[Chorus]
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yo you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam

When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yeah you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam

Skillz,"On the real, I freak techniques and beats in my sleep
The mack back in action show skills when I speak
Watch my - leak when I bring it to your face
I still corner dimes, but in the nine I'm on a paper chase
Glass rocks, mega tops, Tims on your block
Holding heat like crock pots and keeping g's in my socks
(So, what's up, hopps?)
I got to keep it tight like seams
'Cause ain't no fiends
Coming in between me and my dreams
See what I mean, black?
I keep it real like that
F a ""word is bond""
I need stocks and bonds from these ill raps
Rappers won't see me with contacts, friend
So, please act you've got a Siamese twin and think again
'Cause in the end I start off with flavor
Next to bless your chest with freestyle fantasia
Smooth behavior
Seeing rappers as illusions
Meaning they disappear but I'm hear to keep you moving

chorus:
Everybody, move ya body!
Everybody, move ya body!
Everybody, move ya body!
I don't think twice, kid
You know I bring it to ya live

See, I don't get writer's block
Yo, I block other writers
And there's been nights I had to wear sniper attire for biters
Don't make that same mistake and get scarred, retard
I see that tape you listening to got you thinking that you hard
But dig this...
Cut your hair and get your name on your stomach
I still find ways to make your whole rap career plummet
Maintain
I steal mics out of the frame
But now people think they know me 'cause they know my real name
While I stay same
Doing shows and tours
Somewhere in a phat crib(?) playing Sega in the dashboard
Styles of sword(?) and flowing steadily
Trapping MCs in mazes forever like Frankie Beverly
You know the steeze
I'm bringing beats to they knees
Holacausting MCs and sees some g's before I breath
That's how it be
It's no doubt that I
Got to bring it to your chest as I bring it to ya live

chorus

So, from this point on until the day that they bury me
I'll still be on a hunt trying to snatch this currency
Putting my peeps on while friends turn fake
They get pissed thinking I be in Switzerland checking some real estate
Dropping LPs every year
Somewhere in a mansion with a butler named Vincent Jeffrey Belvadere
I'm rare
But, rappers ain't trying to hear
The reason why their girl freestyled her number in my ear
It's my year, son, and I ain't trying to slip
I'm trying to collect props and get not(?) to stretch money clips
Honey-dips
I keep 'em on like low end
So, f five-o
Illegal, so we don't got to go there
It's so unfair
How I do wack crews shady
They want to be next up
Their style sucks like a new baby
They can't faze me
Mics and man fusion
Beats I keep bruising
Do your thing and keep moving

So for every loyal nigga (what?) it's two spoiled niggaz (true)

You in the wrong motherfuckin place tryin to be Scarface
Niggaz be schemin and slippin on Henny demon
Tryin to outlast the next ass, cash got him fiendin
to rock on the wrong blocks and don't know the tactics
In God we trust, mad deep like Sounds of Blackness
Locked in the rule of no sharin, it might seem
I'm selfish but I'm for delf I can't spend whipped cream

Makin plans to jam after they bag up this next gram
Brothers gettin laced, I caught a new case
But if they want me, they got to kill me twice like Screwface

Out here some ol' (?) Columbian blindfold shit (true)
Dou-ble go to club chill drink holder (uhh)
Discrete down to low cabbage gettin street soldiers (hah)

It`s time to bring it down, don`t front on the sound
Check your thunderpound, it be Skillz blowing up from the underground
Now, don`t waste your time and try to taste mine
I`m killing MC`s and going low-key like baselines
Be hesitant, VA residents ain`t friendly
Diss and I`ll walk on your back like Mr. Benny
When my shit drop, all this wack shit`ll stop
Till Janet stops, rockin` Planet Rock
Keepin` it real hot
I specialize in microphone satisfaction
Hackin` MC`s who think Skillz be relaxin`
Straight from punchline ave, metaphor metropolis
I`m shockin` MC`s like seeing their grandmothers topless
Watch this, check for my sequal
I make raps and niggas vanish like the Village People
Hey, you checkin` for me check ?round my way

Now I`m in, so watch me Kline like Calvin
I`m the Dread Man, you fucked up by lettin` me make an album (huh)
The outcome is ill, when I grip the steel
Don`t be mad at me (why?), if you ain`t got no skill
No questions, no second guessin` without a doubt

Doing MC`s anytime, anyplace like Janet Jackson
It ain`t about dirt roads and corn bread
Niggas be MC`ing, G`ing, war deeds and dread
After this pack it up, I`ll tell you my plan
I`m on a VA tour with Kalonji my man
Check it, hittin` city to city like a horny trucker
This year, it`s East Coast like a motherfucker
Misconceptions are coming back like reflections
Niggas who dissed, are now checkin` for my section
They want to be down, they makes me laugh

Waiting for the bubble to burst
Over your stagnant pauses

Or light a fire below the death of me

Days spin through my heart

Now I'm up and running
Strong enough to walk away
And leave you all alone
I won't be lost

Waiting for the straw to break
Over the back of desperate ways

You were a dream to me
Now you're nothing but a heart
that bleeds

Those waves they came for me
Egged on by scarlet sun

Shine on your face
Only the darkness blinds your way

You take it easy
You walk on your own
Look for the sunshine (you'll) find (your) way home

Just let the sun
Find your way home

That floods my pretty dreams
I snap awake from love

'Twas a girl I learned it from 
Living down Sonora way. 
I don't look much like a lover, 
Yet I say her love words over. 
Often when I'm all alone 
""Mi amor, mi corazon"" 

Nights when she knew where I'd ride 
She would listen for my spurs, 
Fling the big door open wide, 
Raise them laughing eyes of hers. 
And my heart would nigh stop beating 
When I heard her tender greeting, 
Whispered soft for me alone --- 
""Mi amor, mi corazon"" 

Moonlight on the patio, 
Old senora nodding near, 
Me and Juana talking low 
So the Madre couldn't hear. 
How the hours would go a-flyin! 
And too soon i'd hear her sighin' 
In her little sorry tone --- 
""Adios, mi corazon."" 

But one time I had to fly 
For a foolish gamblin' fight, 
And we said a swift goodbye 
In that black unlucky night. 
When I'd loosed her arms from clingin' 
With her words the hoofs kept ringin', 
As I galloped north alone --- 
""Adios, mi corazon."" 

Never seen her since that night, 
I can't cross the line, you know. 
I am wanted for gambling debt; 
Like as not it's better so. 
Yet I've always sort of missed her 
Since that last wild night I kissed her; 
Left her heart and lost my own 
""Adios, mi corazon.""

Skip Gorman," In the lobby of a big hotel in [C] Ney York town one [G] day
 Sat a bunch of fellows telling yarns to [A7] pass the time a[D]way
They [G] told of places where they'd been and [C] different things they'd [G] seen
[C] Some preferred Chi[G]cago town while [D7] others New [D] Orleans


(Chorus)
[G] I can [C] see the cattle grazing o'er the [G]hills at early morn
I can [C] see the campfires smokin at the [G] breaking of the [D] dawn
I can [G] hear the bronco's [G7] neighing I can [C] hear the cowboy sing
I'd [G] like to be in Texas for the [D7] round-up in the [G] spring.


(Verse 2)
In a corner in an old armchair sat a man whose hair was gray
He listened to them eagerly to what they had to say
They asked him where he'd like to be his clear old voice did ring
I'd like to be in Texas for the round-up in the spring


(Chorus)


(Verse 3)
They sat and listened carefully to each word he had to say
They knew the old man sitting there had been a top hand in his day
They asked him for a story of his life out on the plains
Slowly he removed his hat then quietly began.


I've seen  em stampede o'er the hills till you'd think they'd never stop
I've seen  em run for miles and miles until their leader dropped
I was a foreman of a cow ranch the calling of a king
I'd like to be in Texas for the round-up in the spring.


(Chorus)


(Final Verse)
I'd like to sleep my last long sleep with mother earth for bed
My saddle for a pillow, the bright stars overhead
Then I could hear the last stampede, the songs of rivers sing
Way back down in Texas for the round-up in the spring.  ",I'd Like to Be in Texas

That's word
To any and everybody who ever quoted
I swear you could've been down
And what's worse is you'll never notice
What's up?

Uh, I mean what's to understand?
Always knew I had it coming
All I needed was a plan ah no
Now all these new girls wanna be down
(Down, down, down down)
But nah, nah
Middle finger and a blunt
Motherfuck a non-believer
On my mama, word to God, ah no
Nigga you will never ever be
(Down, down, down down)

I've been asking you to stay
But no matter what I say
You can't see that I'm the one you're looking for
I can't take the games you play
When you look the other way
I'm not sure if I can take this anymore
Can't you see?
I could be?
Everything you want and more
Let me be what you need
Don't you know that I adore you?
Boy you know that I could be down for you
Let me be the one that you're down for too",Down

And the love and the work it’s hard to balance them
All the time that I lost tryna salvage it
Man these niggas lost they swag that’s some tragic shit
I’m a prince come smoke in one of my palaces
Go together like Pusha T and Malice did
Nah I don’t love her
I was with the homies 'cause the homies will comfort
You know how it is
Dabbin' too much call me Wax Payne
Her dad famous yo I only know her last name

I smoke weed all the time get forgetful
Stay with me for the night I’ll be gentle
And I tend to smash girls who don’t give a fuck
And drink twenty dollar vodka and red bulls
And she gotta a lot of baggage she ain’t get to
And she say she got some problems she gon’ get through
Well I’m like we all got our issues
Stay up all night smoke weed watch visuals
Thinking too much make it big when it’s little
I’m the realest nigga out girl it’s simple
You got questions, I got the answers
Drunk at the club spillin' whiskey on the dancers
I need a purpose, she need a surface
Catch a car to the crib girl it’s urgent

Is when I leave she be so persistent
Crib overseas cause my bitch is foreign
Please light the weed get to problem solving
Never mind school we got lots of knowledge
She got some big dreams but she stuck in college
Look me in the eye since you speak
Like you got this shit all figured out (all figured out)
Keenan got the Audi and we all liquored out
Took one dab now she all trippin' out
SportsCenter anchor this a whole different route
She mad I live at home, like you ever moving out
Bitch, patience is the key

Tell me who the most consistent
Is tell her chill, be home in an instant
I took her out for dinner, called the Uber, see it yet?
Look at me and laugh, she say ""you ain't copped the Beamer yet?""
Selling records now, ain't you supposed to flex more?
Playing in like 16 countries on my next tour
She said ""I get it but at least could send a text more
If you got time for the music, what's the rest for?""
Everything in due time, patience is a virtue
Thinking about what other people got should never hurt you
If you're too weak your heart gets broken like a curfew
Anything worth having always takes some time to pursue
Nothing comes fast except a virgin
Can never take a shortcut, I'm not that type of person
If you love what you have, well then what's the point of searching?
I ever hear you cheatin' it's a wrap like a turban
Quick visits here and there, hope it helps still
I know she longs for commitment and something else real
I'm never around, she look like she on the shelf still
Told me ""you don't cop a ring soon, someone else will""

It's not complicated, yo, it's super simple
Now Skizzy be the man wanna see you doing good
I don't wanna get rich, leave you in the hood
Girl in my eyes you the dopest
Reason why I love you 'cause you always keep focused
And I'm always stressing but you know I keep hoping
Had the door closed now you always keep open
Keep smoking, keep motion

Don't say nothin' foul, you on speakerphone
It's just the homies and I told em that you comin' thru
Leave the club at 1 or 2, probably leave at 1 or 2
Keep it casual, bitches mad at you
Keep it pushin' girl, and move it lateral

So baby why you actin' cool?
Why you actin' coy, girl I ain't a fool
Let's get it, but only if you wit it
And I hate commitment
And man I need forgiveness

I probably really didn't
It's too late, but now I really did it

Tonight, while you are gone
Tomorrow things will look different, I know

Aggressive when I drink too much
Hopin' that she understand
But I know she understand
Shorty I'm the fuckin' man
And I say that cause I always do deliver
Well maybe I should chill and reconsider
These niggas can't compete, they resumes is weak
Drivin' somewhere cool, the city with dumb heat
Shorty wanna dance, I'm a little bit clumsy
You got your boobs enhanced, they look at little bit bigger
And I know you got these niggas all over you
But she got a [?] and I'm a little bit iller
Put the bottle in the freezer, a little bit chiller
We need something to mix the weed with
Stay up 'til 7 and watch the sunrise, all night with the weed lit
Cookin' breakfast in my flannel, isn't the view scenic?

But she broke my heart when her stop came
On the L with some headphones on
I wonder what you bumpin' in those in-ears
I want to say what's up but I been scared
Vibes out of thin air, full car, blank stares
I wonder if you single or you got a man
I bet you like me you got a lot of fans
I wonder if you smoke if you drink too
I wonder if you care what I think too
We don't know each other but that's all good
I'm chasing love like we all should
I wonder where she headed, Lord knows

City is fucking heartless
Easy to get tarnished
Beauty in all the darkness
There's wealth in all the poverty
You're like I won the lottery
You'll never get tired of me
You remind of a lot of things
Martin and Gina, my Iliad and Odyssey
Girl I want to make you proud of me
I know I act stupid but you know I'm talented
The chaos the mayhem
Girl smile the suns out
The city got crazy

You're talkin' too fast, you're thinkin' too slow.
The pickup gets in your way, you go too far and you're stuck Right!

A Where did ya come from? Now where did ya go?
You're kickin' too fast and you're pushin' too slow
When trouble gets in your way, You bend right down and get stuck! Right!

Do you remember yesterday?
Times all changed and we went away,
Old times seem so far away, where's yesterday?

You're goin' too fast, you're tryin to make a go,
He's movin' so fact and you're breakin' too slow
You feel so bad you won't let me know how is today

Do you remember yesterday?
Don't forget what we used to play
Old times seem so far away, screw yesterday

We're fallin' apart but now we don't know

Said we'd all come another day
All together we all moved on and it's gone away

Power, money, holy roads
Information overload
Leave me in the bitter cold to die

Killing time has just begun
Clinging to a holy gun
Leave me in the blazing sun to die

You get nothing for nothing
Except what you steal
I've got a cut in my soul
That just won't heal

Inject myself with cyanide
Break on through to the other side
Gimme one more try
One last lie, goodbye

Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, you go down
Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, Chaos

Breaking every promise made
Redefine a better way
Asphyxating while I pray, I'm dead

Destroy offend and terrorize
Nothing left to vandalize
You can't make me compromise, I'm dead

You get nothing for nothing

So if you think you're in control
It's dragging you further down the hole
Right when you thought it all would end
All of the pain is back again
Every attempt to make it stop
Is taking you right back to the top
Nothing you do can change it now
Not that it matters anyhow

Erase my memory

Was gone without a trace

All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied

Follow your heart, and nothing else

'Bout to get rowdy right now.
Yeah. I'm an all time factor, I make the next guy look like an actor.
So the mandam wail like they matter, when I touch mic I see the men scatter,
And they wanna talk big, but when it comes to big it they bout to get splatter,
So I tell them to relax yourself, go home to your mom and stop being a catta
Many guys wanna parr, many guys lookin to take this thing far
Many guys lookin to be some big star, but soon enough them man about to get slappa
So there's no need for chatter, no need for anything cheap and that's that
Anybody making a ting to get smacked up, back up, fam no need to sound back

When I touch mic I see the men scatta
Scatta, as if I had a clutch on a magnum

You're just another pawn in my game, another god figure pour in the rain,
I'm a raw one, too much of a force to contain,
And I'm forced to repay all the thoughts of the brain,
By any means I ain't putting pure spits to shame,
What I depict on scripts too much for the mandem,
And I keep calm when more shits a spray,
And when I'm letting off as if I had a clutch on a magnum.
See you making at me in the fashion,
Most of these mc's are straight gassin,
Yeah they getting paid on the JSA,
Like its something like guy got draper from Mad Men.
Bagging up while I'm racking hits by the minute,
I'm sick with the lyrics, so you best be backin up
Chatta with a little more flex,
doesn't matta cos when I ratatat bars watch the bare man scatta

When I touch mic I see the men scatta
Scatta, as if I had a clutch on a magnum",Scatta
