Everette Harp,"Hey baby
That's alright people
I know that's alright
Oh, when we love each other
I know that's alright
Oh feel it, feel it
Oh everybody feel it
God know that's alright, yes
Some of us were born
With money to spend
Some of us were born
For races to win
Some of us are aware
That it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind
Of poverty blowing in the air
For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
Ah, and heed the people's cries
Let me say to you
Right on
Right on, feel it
Yea, oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey right on
For those of us who live
Where peace is craved
For those of us who live, uh-huh
Where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life
Yea, surrounded by good fortune and wealth
Talk about it
Those of us who live a life
Hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned
In the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else
Love
That's all it is
We need love
That's all it is
Oh, oh
Love, love
Love's the thing
Love, love, love, love
Sweet love, love
Wonderful love
Ah, true love, love
Love for your brother
Love, for God
Pure love
Love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find
Peace sublime
And my darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you
To live where love is King
Ah, ah baby, baby
Ah, ah, ah, baby
People, people
People who love and care
That's alright
Alright
Ah...",Right On
Everette Harp,"I just want to ask a question
Who really cares?
To save a world in despair
There'll come a time, when the world won't be singin'
Flowers won't grow, bells won't be ringin'
Who really cares?
Who's willing to try to save a world
That's destined to die
When I look at the world it fills me with sorrow
Little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow
Oh what a shame, such a bad way to live
All who is to blame, we can't stop livin'
Live, live for life
But let live everybody
Live life for the children
Oh, for the children
You see, let's save the children
Let's save all the children
Save the babies, save the babies
If you wanna love, you got to save the babies
All of the children
But who really cares
Who's willing to try
Yes, to save a world
Yea, save our sweet world
Save a world that is destined to die
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, oh dig it everybody",Save the Children
Everette Harp,"Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yea

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on
What's going on
Ya, what's going on
Ah, what's going on

In the mean time
Right on, baby
Right on
Right on

Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
Ya, what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's going on - Uh
Right on baby
Right on baby",What's Going On
Everette Harp,"Hey baby, what'cha know good
I'm just gettin' back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end,
When will people start gettin' together again
Are things really gettin' better, like the newspaper said
What else is new my friend, besides what I read
Can't find no work, can't find no job my friend
Money is tighter than it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land
Ah what's happening brother,
Oh ya, what's happening my man
Are they still gettin' down where we used to go and dance
Will our ball club win the pennant, 
do you think they have a chance
And tell me friend, how in the world have you been.
Tell me what's out and I want to know what's in.
What's the deal man, what's happening
What's happening brother
Ah what's happening brother
What's happening my man
Ah what's happening brother
What's been shaken up and down the line
I want to know cause I'm slightly behind the time.
",What's Happening Brother
Everette Harp,"Ah, wholy holy
Come together
Wholy holy
People got to come together
And I know with the strength, power and all the feeling
Wholy holy
Wholy holy
Oh Lord, come on get together, one another
Oh Lord
Wholy holy
Wholy holy
Wholy holy we believe in one another
Wholy holy we believe in Jesus 
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return
He left us a book to believe in
In it we've got an awful lot to learn
Oh, wholy holy
Oh Lord
We can conquer hate forever, yes we can
Ah, wholy holy, Oh Lord
We can rock the world's foundation
Yes we can
Better believe it
Wholy holy together and wholy
Holler love across the nation
Oh, oh
Wholy holy
We proclaim love, our salvation
Oooh, ooh",Wholy Holy
Everette Harp,"Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head
But I just want to live each day 
To love her for what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind
But, very well, I believe I know you-very well
Wish that you knew me too-very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, and I think I can face-very well
Wish that you knew me too-very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head
Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream
My woman want to be a superwoman
And I just had to say good-bye
Because I can't spend all my hours start to cry
But, very well, I believe I know you
Very well wish that you knew me too
Very well, and I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, think that I know you too
Very well, wish you knew me like I know you
Very well, but I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Your filthy head
Very well, dum dum da, dum dum da
Very well, wish you knew me too
Very well, and I wish I could think of everything going through your head
Very well, dum dum da, dum da, dum da dum dum da, dum da, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
When the summer came you were not around
Now the summer's gone and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you-last winter, my love?
When the winter came you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past
When the winter came you were not around
Through the bitter winds love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you, last winter, my love?
Oh I need you baby, I need you baby
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed,
But tomorrow will reflect love's past oh
Spring will fill the air and you will come around,
Well is it summer love that will let me down,
Where were you when I needed you, last winter, my love?
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Right now, right now, right now
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my dear
I need you baby, I need you baby, I need you baby
Oh, Where were you when I needed you last winter, last winter
Yea, need you baby, need you, need you baby,
Oh, you want me too need you baby
Oh where were you when I needed you last, dear
Yea",Where Were You When I Needed You
Everette Harp,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay
Evereve,"Been has her being
Urged to the dwelling of your ancestors
All the long way to their resting place
Now your place, nothing left, no more

Hungering your love lies in a coffin
Can see the laughing vault
Ram dripping on darkened woods
Love's soul is fearlessly sold

Escaped from our world
My elegy accompanies you
She's buried under autumn leaves

During a howling storm
Dusty claws are grasping at her
Thirsting for infinity
This is not her destiny",Autumn Leaves
Evereve,"Und unter ew gem eise begraben
Liegt die deele da und schreit
Muss sich sich nahren, muss sich laben
An des daseins dunkelheit nichtigkeit",Epilogue
Evereve,"""Don't care. It won't change anything.
Perhaps I
Don't care, but it's not that easy to be sure
When
Your laughter still resounds in my ears.
""Don't
Care. Today I look at you through other eyes
And
More and more it seems to be sure I was
Blinded.

Verdammtes leiden, saures lieben,
Verdammt das leben, dessen Schem
Verschwand, stillschweigend aber stetig,
Um nunmehr stumppes Nichts zu sein

Verdammt die Traume, die ich hatte
Heut noch nab'und haben verge
Sie sind nun schal,was ubrigblied
Sind stille Tranen auf der Erde

""Fur Hoffnung 1st es me zu spat-""
Dacht'ich - Doch was 1st mir geblieben?
Wo 1st die
Hoffnung wo das licht?

Wo der Frubling nach langem Winter,
Der nun das graue Eis zerbricht?
Verdammt sind wir, verdammt zu lieben",A New Winter
Evereve,"Masks concealed the real mourning
No noise were allowed
Misfortune came with large steps
Enveloped the future into a shroud

The bride wears black tonight

Valleys got deeper and deeper
The summits disappeared in beautiful
Clouds a path
In sick infinity
Deep abysses and beside it

Travelled in endless trains
Try to solve my existence
Sins, often pure temptation
Praised, hallowed, just lies [repeat]

Voices to bear, inner futility
Be it true, be it my love
Coming to torture you
To torture you with my devotion

Masks concealed the real mourning
No noise were allowed
Misfortune came with large steps
Enveloped the future into a shroud",Prologue: The Bride Wears Black
Evereve,"Huge and ashen and overfull roll the clouds
To crush the horizon and affliction drops
Viciously as trip, deprives the mind I would
Just need to learn silent oblivion from the world",To Learn Silent Oblivion
Evereve,"""First leaves touch the ground
Shadows are to be our company
An age draws near
In which days die away, die softly
When the light dwindles
When the curtain falls
The sun is conquered
Grey veils cover the world
And our hearts vanish the void""

[ZWIELIGHT]

""Erste blatter beruhren die erde
Schatten werden zu unseren gefahrten
Es bricht heren eine zeit
In der tage vergluhen, sanft sterben
Wenn das licht schwindet
Wenn der vorhang fallt
1st die sonne besiegt
Verhullen graue schleier die welt
Und unsere herzen verlieren sich I'm
Nichts.""",Twilight
Evereve,"Werde untergehen und auferstehen
Erhalten durch elixiere gemischt aus blut
Wer will mich halten, wer mich toten,
Wer solite sie loschen, meine glut?

Ich spucke feuer aus der tiefe meines
Herzens
Da meine welt zugrunde geht-
Mein hang zur qual hat sie zerstort
Auf knien das ende herbeigefleht

Hab'mich erborochen nachdem ich dich
liebte
Als do nackt vor mit lagst
Ein zeichen demer augen, ein gutes
Geschenkt dir aus schmerzen, auch wenn
do klagst

[repeat chorus]

word'dich vermissen, so tief der schmerz
Die angst macht alles noch viel schlimmer
Durch meine adern fliesst atzende saure

Noch uber den wolken fliege ich
Die luft voll der vogel gekreische
Mein wille, er jagt mich, verfolgt mich

Fleische",Untergehen und Auferstehen
Evereve,"Fading light - I see the shadows fall.
I hear the darkness sigh.
As it rises from a dead man's pillow.
Taking his last breath to the winds outside.

Threads of moonlight torch the ground.
Show forms a cover of silence.
Candlelight spreads its wings over my soul.
The flame illuminates the night.

Searching for answers, my mind's deceit.
With myself torn to fragments, my life means defeat.
Where is my saviour?
Why did he leave me alone?
In my winter frost palace where sorrows are sown.

I try to find a way deep into my dreams.
Try to flee from cruel reality.
To be suspended into a sea of emptiness.
And never, never wake up again.

Did you ever hear a dead baby crying in its cradle?
Did you ever see a black sun rising above a silent world?
Did you ever speak words no one would ever hear?
Did you ever scream out what you feel when you see the pain?

I see a new day, the candlelight dies.
The darkness meets the beauty of the light.",A Winternight Depression
Evereve,"One touch of your hand can open the heavens
abducts me to long forgotten meadows of desire
Strange, I never believed that one glance of eyes
Would be able to touch me inside like yours did
I always thought that something was buried
Long time ago, deep inside...

One touch...

...And there never was a greater pleasure
Than to stay awake for hour and hold you tight
To feel your silent breath upon my hand
As I push your hair from your face
And I dare not to wake you
For this would make me, too...",Dedications
Evereve,"So we have left behind the ceaseless change
The ceaseless change of seasons,
Embittered by the inevitable maelstrom
That draws us towards the fields of winter
Where crows burst out in their scornful cries.
And our eyes fall on the realm of much prouder
But nevertheless even sadder creatures
The realm of the Storm birds",Embittered
Evereve,"Our life flourished amid a brown Mother Earth
Broke through the rocks, broke through straight towards the sun

Stygian light winks through the clouds
Retched into this heart of mine
Shines onto my life from nothingness
And I ravished the rays of sunshine
Unfinished we participate in the run of life, our inner strife
Hidden inside us the need to end, to end our pain

One with nature, spoiled, without a zest for life
Sparkling bodies embraced by ebony nights

Sometimes all our words are inadequate for the burden of our hearts

Once ashes we will be and still the hunger for a new life
Or a soon coming death
And the dust we will crumble to will be the companion
Of the four winds wailing over our souls

The ashes still the hunger of a new coming death
The dust is the companion of the four winds from our hearts",Fields of Ashes
Evereve,"Ein kuhler Hauch loscht sanft die Kerzen
Die die kahlen Wande zieren
Was wird die heutige Nacht noch bringen
Werden wir verbrennen oder erfrieren?

Gefahren aus dem Nichts entstanden
Vervolgen Dich in eine andere Dimension
Verflucht, verteufelt, der Verzweiflung nahe
Erleben wir unsere letzte Vision.

Gestrandet vor der Bucht des Todes
In stiller Hoffnung der ertsehnten Erlosung
Die Angst liegt klamm auf unseren Schultern
Wird uns entkleiden bis zur volligen Entblosung

Martyrium
Das Ende selbst herbeigesehnt
Wirft seine Schatten weit foraus
All Menschen von Gott verlassen
Nicht mehr lange, dann das Aus",Martyrium
Evereve,"Quand le ciel bas et lourd pese comme un couvercle
Sur l'esprit gemissant en proieaux longs ennuis,
Et que de l'horizon embrassant tout le cercle
Il nous verse un jour noir plus triste que les nuits;

Quand la terre est changee en un cachot humide,
Ou l'Esperance, comme une chauve-souris,
S'en va battant les murs de son aile timide
Et ce cognantla tete a des plafonds pourris;

Quand la pluie etalant ses immenses trainees
D'une vaste prison imite les barreaux,
Et qu'un peuplemuet d'infames araignees
Vient tendre ses filets au fond de nos cerveaux,

Des cloches tout a coup sautent avec furie
Et lancent vers le ciel un affreux hurlement,
Ainsi que des esprits errants et sans patrie
Qui se mettent a geindre opiniatrement.

- Et de longs corbillards, sans tambours ni musique,
Defilent lentement dans mon ame, l'Espoir,
Vaincu, pleure, et l'Angoisse atroce, despotique,
Sur mon crane incline plante son drapeau noir.",Spleen
Evereve,"Like a storm-driven bird at night
We came flying out of nowhere
And for a moment our wings gleamed
Like gold in the light of fire
And are gone again to the nowhere

The cold grey sea, it waits for me
And the foaming waves call me down
To howling winds and a steel blue sky
But the cold grey sea calls forever

Like gold fall the leaves an the wind
When farewell time, autumn has come
All these years they have passed
Like the wave on the shore of the sea

Time passes, the place I search for
It's still just a longing inside
Something strange and unknown to me
To be grounded somewhere, no longer
A stormbird in shaking and howling",Stormbirds
Evereve,"Give me the sleep I need to forget
My pain and my sorrow, my grief and my dept
Give me the sleep I need to forget
Hypocrisy, cruelty, hatred and if

There's someone to hear me, then answer my cries
And if you are near me, please drop your disguise
I need to get out, please show me a way
To cope with my dread and my fear every day

Restricted are my paths, destinations of myself far away
The wheel of life has stopped turning, an angel leads me astray
I am longing for farewell, just a passenger in a boat
A boat called life - after which wave will it lose its load

Void, peace and stillness, is what I yearned for
Let me be a fallen star, insignificance is what I will earn

Universe, I want to drift in your eternity
Universe, lay your arms around my soul
Universe, a part of you I want to be
Universe, your star of death I've seen it glow

I want to drift into your eternity, lay your arms around my soul
A part of you I want to be, your star of death I've seen it glow

Prepared for your reception
Your timeless nothingness awaits me
Universe, are you a part of me?
A part of you I want to be.",Universe
Evereve,"As sirens screamed out in the darkness
And fire fell down from the sky
As we cowered again in the bunker
We all knew the reason why

As our houses lay in ruins
And our sons were shot side by side
As the devil danced upon the graveyard
We all knew who's to blame

""For I am not one of the cowards
For I'm neither mortal nor weak
For I am the one you have longed for
A new master-race forsee""

He that is without sin among you
Let him first cast a stone on you
Joh. 8,1
 
 If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
If leaders feed beggars, a nation of beggars will fight

Those you once seduced
Are now here to be crucified
The principle of a fool
Who's betrayed and sacrificed

And to the fire-ey'd maid of smoky war
All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit,
Up to the ears in blood
Shakespeare",Dies Irae (Grave New World)
Evereve,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun,
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy,
And God, I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor,
Sewed my new blue jeans.
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans.

Now, the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk,
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all a drunk.
 
Oh, Mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done,
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun.

Well, I've got one foot on the platform,
The other foot on the train.
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain.

Well, there is a house in New Orleans

And God, I know I'm one.",House of the Rising Sun
Evereve,"They pass me when I close my eyes
Ragged lines of ragged grey
Grey their faces, grey their hands
Grey the ghosts that haunt this land
Their pain, it echoes through the hills
Through no one living ever left

This is Kolyma - a graveyard for the lost
The muffled sounds of cries and moans
Od swearing, shooting and commands
They all disappeared in this big land
Where summer's harsh and winter kills
Where gold is hidden, death's for free
And freedom came from weapon steel

This is Kolyma - a graveyard for the lost
The forest conquered all the camps
Broke walls, cut fences down to earth
The forest conquered all the camps

Howls like calling up the dead

Evereve,"Blessed are the fallen
Hearts full of grief
Blessed are the feeble
Who deny their own belief
I am stranded
Forgotten and forlorn

See the scarecrows laughing
By jesters mesmerized
Staring at me with cruel lies(eyes)

So bleed for me
To set me free... right now...

Thy will be done... forever...

Don't you ever blame me for the fact i was born.

I feel an inner compulsion-demanding restlessly.
Hold me, I crumble... My silvergod (don't leave me alone, i need you)
I swear to you, I'll always need you, always keep you.
Never let you go.

Evereve,"There's something cold inside of us.
There's something empty inside out hearts.
The bitter-sweet harmony of gentle crimes.
Can't you see? it's burning.
Afraid of being honest, afraid of showing pride.
The shade of self-deception, it's rising.
A little black devil want's to be free again.
A little black devil yearns for his dignity.
Return... repent... deliver us from evil.
Open your heart, open your heart for me.

What drives us on and on, i'm shaking.

Return - Open your arms (open up).
Repent - Await your fallen star (wait for me).
Remind - Open your heart (open up wide / and shine on).

what makes me forgive all the cruelty of your deeds?

Your every vicious thought
Lacking self-confidence
Deception in it's purest form

I am your hesitation

The hand you reach for when no one's there
In a charade so perfect

Come walk this way
And I'll have you
I'll show you yearning, dreaming
Your humble servant

Your trust so precious
I'm the user, the abuser
Haunting, serving
The great deceiver

I am your false beauty
I am your hidden hate
The hideous face of sloth
What makes you degenerate

And I am the shadow
What you sense when no one's near

I fled the fear and the dark of day
Like an angel of fallen grace
My broken wings can't hold my weight, no

I came so close that I felt the flames
I came so close that I'll never be safe again
I'd give anything to find a way
To leave the fear and evacuate

Come reach inside my inner fear
Come feel my sorrow and my tears
My broken wings can't hold my weight
Through the dark of day

Leave that guilt stained cross behind
Free your arms do it one by one

It's not your fault, you are not to blame
Your wing clipped past should not bring you shame
And the years that you still endured
Should work as strength to see past it all

Come reach inside my inner fear
Come feel my sorrow and my tears
My broken wings can't hold my weight
Through the dark of day

All hope's been burnt to ashes
And I'm so tired of hiding the bruises
My broken wings can't take me
Through the dark of day

Deep cuts will not help you heal
The pain inflicted is just false relief
Precious moments where you can dream
Of a day when you too can feel

Come reach inside my inner fear
Come feel my sorrow and my tears
My broken wings can't hold my weight
Through the dark of day

All hope's been burnt to ashes
And I'm so tired of hiding the bruises
My broken wings can't take me
Through the dark of day

",Broken Wings
Evergrey,"Was your wish that I hadn't seen you
When they came to take you away?
Was your wish that I would believe you
To make you stop and make you stay?

Did you think that I'd never leave you
That I'd be there from dusk till day?
Did you think that I'd always save you
And carry you on my arms to the far away?

And how can you deny me hope and
And how we should rise to see you walk the water?
Can you deny my hopes when
'Cause all you really did was just to make it hurt?

Did you think of all the blame that you left me with?
Did you think of all the guilt that I now feel?
I thought that I was close as someone ever get
I was so wrong to think that I knew you

So now I relive that moment everyday
Asking forgiveness for the things that I never got to say
And how will I ever rid the thoughts
Or even make them fade away?

How can you deny me hope and
And how we should rise to see you walk the water?
Could you forsake all hope to fail
And all you really ever achieved was to make me fall into the water?

And how could you give up the chance to make this work again?
And why 'cause all you really did was to just make us fall into the water
Would you not offer me the chance to prove I've changed?
And how 'cause all you really did was just to make us fail

I fear my heart, fear my soul
I fear I'm weak, I'm fearing you, I fear the cold
That the world is yours, that I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong that I don't belong, I fear the cold

All nights of fallen grace
All nights where I lost the trace
All I need is that single hour
Where all doubt's erased

If I could I'd crown myself each day
If I could I'd let myself know I'm okay
If I could I'd throw myself into the flames

But I fear my heart, fear my soul
I fear I'm weak, I'm fearing you, I fear the cold
That the world is yours, that I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong and I don't belong, I fear the cold

I wish for dreamless sleep
For something that will keep all thought silent
All screams of inner fear makes control impossible
Tears me open

If I could I'd crown myself each day
If I could I'd let myself know I'm okay
If I could I'd throw myself into the flames

If I could I'd crown myself each day
If I could I'd let myself know I'm okay
If I could I'd throw myself into the flames

My heart's on the ground
My bare feet soaked in my blood
As I leave you without a sound

Even though I stretched too far
No sky to warm me up
As darkness clouds the blue

I'm leaving
I couldn't live with the shame
No more denying
I've stopped the search for blame

Heading for virgin soil
Set foot on sacred ground
And with no one to reach for
No, no one

Twenty seven years of falling
Twenty seven winters slave
Twenty seven years of dreaming
And this is all the strength life gave

Twenty seven summers weaker
And the autumn's just the same
Twenty seven years

And if you'd ask then I'd deny that
I didn't have the strength to fight that growing weakness
And I buried all signs to cover what I feel underneath
The hollow remains of me

My chest is open
My heart's on the ground
My bare feet soaked in my blood
As I leave you without a sound

And there will be no tomorrow
Won't see the light of day
No more pain and no sorrow
I'm free from the words that you could say

Twenty seven winters slave
Twenty seven years of dreaming
And this is all the strength life gave

I'll prove to them that I am one

'Cause their demands needs more than so

Must prove to them that I'm strong

What's the point of touching it
So close you almost taste it?
What's the point of reaching for it
When all doors are closing?

And I wish I could feel it
That feeling of belonging
Instead I'm sentenced to solitude
And all doors are closing

Through endless nights of anguished sleep
With no one there to hear her screams
She's gone beyond where they can't reach
The bell of freedom sets her free

And when I'm weak and I can't run
Must prove to them that I am strong
Can't hide these scars
Can't hide these wounds

So close you almost taste it?
What's the point of reaching for it
When all doors are closing?

And I wish I could feel it
That feeling of belonging
Instead I'm sentenced to solitude
And all doors are closing

I too have fallen helplessly
Spent a thousand nights sleepless
Had every hope of light shattered before me

Preventing me to reach outside
Stopping me from leaving the black
Keeping me locked inside and all I can ask is why?

And when I'm weak and I can't run
Must prove to them that I am strong
Considering what I've been through
Another cut, another wound

What's the point of touching it
So close you could almost taste it?
What's the point of reaching for it
When all you get is more distant from surface?

And what's the point to be strong enough
Gather strength to rise above
To be brave and see it through
When all you get is more distant from surface

With so much lost in anger, too much built up fear
And all these thoughts colliding making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water making me tired and torn
If only things were different, only things were different

My soul and my inside's been colored and there is no silence
Not distant from courage I'm wearing the loss
My eyes sees the dawn of another horizon
My battle, it rages forever

With so much lost in anger, too much built up fear
And all these thoughts colliding making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water making me tired and torn
If only things were different, if only things were

Brought to me in a different shade
Shown to me so that I could relate
Lock all doors that would make me stray
And offer me a brand new day

Never claimed to be someone I'm not
And always feared to be forgotten
So led astray that I lost all worth
So torn by wounds in a world of hurt

With so much lost in anger, too much built up fear
And all these thoughts colliding making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water making me tired and torn
If only things were different, if only things were
If only things were different, if only things were

",Torn
Evergrey,"It's like when kingdoms fall and you're left without a leader
It's like when dream's your all and all you dream is to see her
And everything reminds you when you were safe in slumber
And the circles you wander grows greater and bigger

So falls the winter snow, so vivid yet lifeless, out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years

Just like when kingdoms fall and the world feels like the deceiver
Their words of comfort still won't reach me, can't touch me
Inside this self created shelter where no one sees, where no one hears
I allow myself to break and really reach to touch the ache

So falls the winter snow, so vivid yet lifeless, out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years

Shadow casts regrets on the wall, I stand alone when my empire fall
As I complete another lap I hope I find the day when it all
Leads me to my final resting place, leaves me alone until I feel safe
Opens me up until I confide in a world where I don't collide

So falls the winter snow, so vivid yet lifeless, out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years

(Goodbye)

[ VERSE 1: Everlast ]
Goodbye, it's over, it's through and done
Our relationship is no longer one on one
So I quit, girl, I don't need this
I'm disgraced cause in my face you spit
I caught you steppin out with another guy
And after givin you my love I deserve to know why
How long has this been going on?
How long have you been doin me wrong?
You thought I didn't know?
You thought I'd never go?
Well, that's why I'm makin this song
To say goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 2: Everlast ]
Pack your bags and leave, get out of my sight
I won't share you with another man on any night
You tried to play me for a fool
But now you'll find that you been schooled
By the E and it's plain to see
You thought you had luck like a four-leaf clover
Your luck just ran out, homegirl, it's over
I hope you had a lot a fun
Were you lyin when you said that I was number one?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter
It makes no difference
I caught you with a smokin gun
Or so to speak, girl, you're a natural sneak
And the hand you dealt me was really weak
But that's alright, you won't see me cryin
I brush a girl off when I catch her lyin
So when I toss you out, don't dare ask why
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
Using me, confusing me, inside you're bruising me
You think I'll stick around so you keep abusing me?
Wise up girl, I ain't playin
You try to make it better sayin let's hit the hay and
Make love, then I'll know that you're loyal
But I can't take the stress, don't need the turmoil
You told me that you love me but it was a lie
You know that I care but I must say goodbye
Who is it you're thinkin about when we're kissin?
And when we're all alone is it him that you're missin?
I couldn't stand the feelin that I got
When I seen another man standin in my spot
Next to you, so what you want me to do?
Forget about it act like it never happened?
Turn the other cheek and wait to get slapped again?
Or until you say when, you're through with me
But you will see I'll be the first one to say goodb-why-e
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 4: Everlast ]
I must admit it, you hid it well
Did you get your kicks puttin me through hell?
Runnin around with your new found child
He's not a man, he can't get wild
But that's alright, girl, you made your choice
And maybe by now you're sick of my voice
But it's too bad cause you made me mad
And I'ma show you all the things that you mighta had
Then you'll be the one feelin pain and misery
Regrettin the past (goodbye) cause you're history
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why
Don't tug at my sleeve as I walk by
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

Get up everybody and listen to this rhyme
My name is Everlast and yo, I'm always on time
I got what it takes to make this groove complete
And when my DJ is cuttin, he's never missin a beat
I'm down with the Syndicate and they're down with me
I'm also down with Divine, Bilal and Quincy D.
Tairrie B., DJ Lethal and my brother cool Nick
Kid Jazz, Scratch, Bango and Cutmaster Quick
I've worked hard and long to master this trade
And to quote my other song yo, I'm just out to get paid
So sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

100 g's and I'm pullin honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on my tip to get a sip
Of this poetical performer that's fully equipped
But I'm out to get paid, not to get laid
All across the country my records gettin played
On radio stations, clubs and on tours
And after every show I make three encores
Sleep on me now for my time will come

Step up, place your bet and I'll serve you fortune
But first I must issue just one word of caution
Dope lyric presentations are my sole notoriety
Everlast is on the rise movin through society
My voice is moist recitin choice vocals
Respected worldwide and feared by locals
Poppin junk out your punk mouth makin bets
It's too late for regrets, it's time to pay your debts
E-v-e-are-l-a-s-t is the name that I bear
A poetic demi-god with skin that's fair

Now there's too many people in this world tryin to play me
Like I'm some kind of sucker constantly they disobey me
Tellin me what's sellin, what kinda records get charted
Sound like him, sound like her - but they all sound retarded
Takin very little time to write down a rhyme
It's confusing to see so many people so blind
Some think that it's a sell-out rhymin to this beat
But Everlast can take any groove and make it sound complete

Everlast,"[ VERSE 1: Everlast ]
Listen up, learn, you'll get your turn
I'm sendin this out to all it may concern
The party master Everlast is here
Before we begin I'm gonna make this clear
I take no short cuts, Bilal adds dope cuts
If girls were around I'd grab and grope butts
And if she got a man and he tries to step up
It's ashes to ashes and dust gets swept up
Tryin to step to me, boy, you must be sick
Got a nine in my pocket, takin heads out quick
I make my music loud, my parents proud
There's not an artist alive drawing a better crowd
Than the Everlasting operator droppin a groove
To make you get up and dance while I bust this move
And talk about myself, I don't need a partner
Bilal has the cuts, then I'll help start the
Show, let a lyric flow and you'll know
I make you jump up out your seats, scream and say ""ho!""
You fall back down completely exhausted
Once you had the sound, but now it seems you lost it
You're worn out, you can't take no more
Since Everlast and Bilal took control of the floor
So jump out your seat, move your feet cause the beat's complete
I'm never missin a beat

(Never missin a beat)	--> George Clinton

[ VERSE 2: Everlast ]
There's no need for askin, I'm the Everlastin
My mind is a poll and I'm gonna cast in
The ocean of words and pull out a new rhyme
And if it feels good, then I'll do it two times
Or maybe three, four, or even five times
When I'm done Bilal cuts up my rhyme
He's my partner, not a stand-in
On a 'highway to heaven' just like Mike Landon
And when it comes to battles my boy's a sure win
He's been in more scandals than J.R. Ewing
Busted up more parties than five-o
When it comes to a fight my boy's good to go
So step on stage, we duke it out like men
I beat you down with every word that flows out my pen
And I was the Green Hornet Bilal'd be Kato
Right by my side kickin up dust
And if a sucker acts stupid, grab my gat and bust
You can't run away cause my clip holds ten rhymes
If you been beaten once, I'll beat you ten times
Worse than you ever been beaten before
I don't drop my mic unless my throat gets sore
And that don't happen because when I'm rappin
My rhymes'd beat Gregory Hines if they was tappin
So jump our your seat, move your feet cause the beat's complete
I'm never missin a beat

(Ain't it funky)

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
Lyrical and linguistic, somewhat artistic
Some call me a devil, others call me mystic-
al like a crystal ball
And if you step to me you'll take a fall
Just like the Roman Empire
Feel the wrath of a devil's hellfire
Callin me a devil, some think it's a diss
To me it's just a name, it's not stones and sticks
You can't hurt me, I got a positive outlook
Readin my good book
Or maybe some philosophy like Socrates and Plato
Step to me with drugs, I just say no
But I'll drink some lemonade if it's ( ? )
I'm down with DLC and the Styler
The D-i-v-Einstein of rhyme
Is down with me cause he knows that I'm
On my way I will not stray
From the path of knowledge that'll earn my pay
I think for myself, I take advice
And if I did it wrong once, then I do it twice
I check my steps, make sure they're correct
And that's why me and DLC get respect
So jump our your seat, move your feet cause the beat's complete

Everlast,"I'll assure you and ensure you you're the one I love
All the Gods up in heaven sent you from above
Sent you down to Earth just to make me smile
Don't you know you're the only thing that's worth while
In my life, be my wife, don't turn me down
You're the best, so say yes and I will never frown
You know you got me on the edge of happiness and despair
Doesn't matter if I slip cause I know you're there
To catch my fall, all in all I'm havin a ball
Whether we're dancin and romancin or leanin on the wall
When I'm with you, girl, I could never be bored
You're so fine and you're mine yes, I thank the Lord
Every minute of the hour, all hours of the day
There's one thing I been dyin to say
I love you

You got me on the edge

We met by chance, I walked in when you were workin
I gave you a glace, advanced and caught you smirkin
At me, the E-v-e, you know the rest
I asked you for your number and began my quest
To conquer your heart, body, soul and mind
You came around and I found that you were one of my kind
So I laid the same old drag, whispered in your ear
But that didn't work and I started to fear
That you might be too much woman for Everlast to handle
In my eyes no girl could hold a candle to you
I was confused - hey yo, what's my next move?
My boys said, ""Relax E, and act real smooth""
But that approach wasn't workin and I realized
That this girl was really different
That scared me a little but it also intrigued me
I wanted to know if you were serious, not tryin to lead me
On, so I confronted you and asked you the time
You said you felt the same way for me and that you'd be mine
Forever

You got me on the edge

So there we were, a match made in heaven
I was thinkin about you girl, 24/7
Every minute, every hour, all day and night
In my bedroom or the shower or when ridin my bike
You're on my mind all the time and my rhyme's redefined
Secret letters to you and they're boldly signed
By me because I love you and I always will
And the thought of bein without you girl, makes me ill
I love you, I need ya, I'll clothe ya and feed ya
You'll never be lonely cause I'll always be there
We'll be together side by side
And when I'm out with my boys I brag about you with pride
I took a picture of you wherever I went
Took you anywhere you wanted, no matter what I spent
I have to admit girl, your lovin was def
But it tore me apart when you left
But now I realize I'm the one to blame
I took a thing like love and turned it into a game
And even though I regret it, I couldn't let it
Show cause I didn't want you to know
The pain that I was feelin deep in my heart
But now I think I'm ready to make a new start
With you

You got me on the edge

Well, we've been through a lot together
Throughout the stormy weather
The only thing I'm sure of is love lasts forever
I know my love is true and I know you love me too
There's only one thing left for you and I to do
Regain the bond that we once had
And once we accomplish that girl, we'll both be glad
I'm better off for it, you can't ignore it
The love that we feel, we both cherish and adore it
So let's stick with it through joy and through sorrow
Take it one day at a time and not worry about tomorrow

You got me on the edge",On the Edge

Get off the tip quick, boy, you're makin me sick
No other partner could be smarter than my man cool Nick
Understand, he's my man with the plan
We come to parties with the posse just to gain some fans
The posse is strong, the lines are long
People flockin to my shows just to hear a song
Like this, it's not a diss, it's a mouthful of bliss
Throw your hands in the air and blow me a kiss
From the crowd cause I'm proud, I say my name loud

It's not rock 'n roll, it's hip-hop music
It's got a lot of soul if you learn how to use it
Well, I'm here to tell suckers go to hell
Others tried to take me down but they're the ones who fell
Ignorance was their downfall
Take it a little at a time, don't go for it all

Cause there ain't no others, listen up brothers
Just because I'm white don't mean that I'm another

You might detect that respect's my topic
I won't rush it but I'll discuss it
Go ahead and pop your shot if you think that you can bust it
But I'ma go on, I'm gonna talk some more
I guarantee you won't be bored if you get on the floor
And go for yours and say that you get it
Get up, get out your seats, get on the floor and get with it

I re-rehearsed every verse and soon you will find

Whether I'm on stage or in my domicile
I'm not fiendin, I don't smoke, I tell you I'm no joke

I knew this cat named Darrell, he didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar
Had a Ph.D., had an M.B.A.
But now he's waiting tables cause their's rent to pay
Companies downsizing, inflation's rising
Can't find a job, he's feeling kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
Forgot to count how many times he been blessed
So he falls off track, starts smoking the crack
And once it hits his brain, starts a chain react
Sells the shirt off his back, shoes off his feet
He's losing all his teeth, now he's out in the street
And all of sudden he's like, Jesse James
Trying to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school, and he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool

Shopping sprees get her on her knees
And if you hit her with keys of your crib, you acting funny
Come home one day, find her counting out your money
From the Wetlands, all the way to the Apollo
If you're broke she'll spit, and if you're rich she might swallow

For the ends, rats snitch on one another
For the ends, sometimes kids get murdered
For the ends, so before we go any further
I want my ends

I knew these two homeboys, who made a lot of noise
Making money on the block, kids was on they jock
They was tougher than leather like Reverend Run
DMC, they was toting guns
And holdin' weight, goin' out of state
Stackin' mad chips, and pushin' phat whips
Fly jewels and golds, and got no job
And then one did some kid, and one got robbed

Ends, some people will rob their mother
For the ends, rats snitch on one another

Niggas come bold but leave here holding jock 
High roll patrol, roll through the set on fifth

Everlast,"I see everybody rockin' the same old style
And everyone's sportin' the same profile
And all of y'all wearin' the same name brands
I hear everybody jackin' these played out jams
I won't reach for no gun, punk, I use my hands
I rock mikes and roll bikes, I cross foreign lands
I made my bones out in zones where twilight be
And every time I touch the mike it's Fright Night Part Three
For every emcee that wannaa test and try
In your custom made wears thinkin' you too fly
Make it up in gold chains what you're lackin' for brains
It's time to call your ma, duke, scoop up your remains
And finally lay to rest all the shit you stressed
Of boastin' and braggin' about the toes you taggin'
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door
While every rapper that's simmed is pimped like a whore
You see the talk is eighteen, three quarters past four
When your doctor slaps my ass, hear the lion roar
The record sales soared and the world got toured
You say what happened to my band, I say I just got bored
Now they call me Whitey Ford, and I praise the Lord
Find me breakin' up your crews, catch me singin' the blues
Strummin' and pickin' like I'm BB King
It's Abdul Rakim, now watch me do my thing

CHORUS
Down, down, you go
Down, down, so low
Down, down, till you hit the floor
Keep fallin' down, till you can't get down no more

You go point blank range with the scope he's knockin'
The Psycho might change but there ain't no stoppin'
The mmon's on the rise when the sun start droppin'
And y'all need to quit the bullshit that you be poppin'
'Cause I've been hip hoppin' since BDP
(???), it's Abdul Rakim
And when referring to me you must respect the name
Make a quick double take and double check your game
'Cause you about to get dissed, I'm checkin' my list
When I check it over twice it's like rollin' dice
I hit four, five, six, I'm all up in your mix
I rock good from Hollywood to the city of bricks
And all these fake cats scream they're keepin' it real
While you're makin' your deal we'll be breakin' the seal
You be breakin' your vows like people worshippin' cows
And then I hit ya with the who's, what's, where's and how's
Like Vinny Barbarino, Matt Pachino
I'm with my man Rino with the Brooklyn Lordz
Crashin' the boards with my soul in a hole
I take it back to the future from the days of old
I'm too cold to hold, too hot not to burn ya
Don't stick your nose in businessthat don't concern ya
Might have to trip and flip like I've Turner
You too old for schoolin', boy, when I'm gonna learn ya

You gotta know the life

When the spark ignite
Now from the break daylight
To the fall of the sun
You gotta pick your fight
It's time to choose your gun

Chorus:
Front to back
Right to left
Keep it live all night
Make it hot to death
Get your heart pumpin' like some crystal meth
Keep it live all night
Make it hot to death

Well...
Hey...

Tell me who's your God
Does he make a lotta dough
I'm gonna take you higher
Or to the fire below

Chorus

Guns to roses
Abraham to Moses
Daylight exposes what the night conceals
Let's break these seals
And get this thing started
Some be out classed
Some be out smarted
Some be over bound by the blindin' rays
I hear the whisper in the night
Get trapped in the maze
See back in the days
When I was juvenile
I dreamed of rockin' on the mic
In a brand new style
Now I'm shakin' these bones
Tryin' to get these shoes
Outbidded major crews
I'm paid crazy dues
Now I'm speakin' on you
They just slept on me
And rumors start spreadin'
Just like a disease
I'll have you down on your knees
Below the spot ground zero
Turn brown and burn down Rome just like Nero
A hero ain't nothing but a
Don't make me say it again

Don't make me say it

So what we gonna do?

Feelin' like somebody just slapped me
Gut's in a knot, my temp's gettin' hot
I want to make that man bleed and wet his speed knot
He ain't got what we had, and it makes me kinda mad
I hurt my one true love, just like my dad
And it's kinda sad, 'cause now my shit's together
No need for umbrellas, I can see the stormy weather
I'm goin' outside into the rain
Like Keith Sweat, 'cause I can't house this pain
We was workin' for years, now I'm jerkin' these tears
>From my lips to God's ears, girl, I did you wrong
So I'm makin' this song, to let you know how I feel
Before keepin' it real, may keep my heart concealed
And now I'm on the side just paitently waitin'
Watchin' on you and the time for updatin'
I can't hide from the truth, I know the pudding's in the proof
So I stand convicted, like all your friends predicted
But I think you'd be surprised on how this ends, brothers
We went from lovers to friends, we'll go from friends to lovers
So if that man make you smile, I guess that I'll 
Just accept it, and respect it
I'll hit you wit' this song and let you think about it
Then I'll just leave you alone and be a man about it",The Letter

Make you cry like a dove, leave you standing alone
In a world so cold, watch the drama unfold
'Cause you sold your soul, now you fearing your death
Sniffin' crystal meth 'til their ain't nothin' left
But, rock bottom hurts when you hit it
You start to reflect on all the friends you shitted
Your pride won't admit it, so you start to sink lower
Your Caught in a flood, and you tryin' to find Noah

If you sleepy and you need a place to lay yo' head
Come take my bed, I'll sleep on the floor

I can't save the whole street, so I feel like I'm beat
And why I play the game when nothin' gonna change?
The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans
I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend

Tryin' to get through this life and get to that door
I'm all up in this mix for these final ticks
Going all the way to seven and it's half past six

I pray to God for love
I make G hot for love
And I just might blow your freakin' car for love
I make you sing ""Hey Love"" like my man King Sun
I freak the art of noise over all you toys
Better bring you boys, summon all you crew
No matter what you do, it's coming back on you
Just like a planet orbits, let your spunge absorb it
Logical conclusion is B-boy fusion
And confusion say that he want control
Of your mentality, your body and your soul
So if you lose your hold, come and take my hand
And link up this chain, 'cause money that's the plan
I'm tryin' to get through this maze, not to win this race
We either ridin' on a horse or walkin' on our face
So come take your place on the side of love
And swallow up your ego and your pride for love

My sister and my girl
I'm prayin' to God
Don't let this go too far
As they rush me into the St. Luke's O.R.
They pull the bullets out my chest
And give 'em back in a jar
Now I'm wearin' this scar
'Cause I tried to play hard

Mr. Ford, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
What are you talkin' about?
It would appear that one of the bullets grazed your spine and damaged the cord.
So what are you tryin' to tell me?
Well, it's safe to say I don't think you'll be jumpin' around anymore.

Yo, this can't happen to me
I just can't believe it
Trapped in a wheelchair
A paraplegic
There ain't no rehab
There ain't no therapy
For the rest of my life
Somebody's gotta take care of me
And people stare at me
With pity in their eyes
And every mornin' I rise to a life of despise
And ever night I think I might never rock the mic again
'Cause my brain's fucked up on percacet and vicadin
Might as well be heroin pulsin' through my veins
Gotta kill these pains
Or blow out my brains
To free me from these chains
I'm trapped in this physical hell
To walk again I just might sell my soul

With legendary status like my name's Lou Brock
And my lanzar sounds be shaking the grounds
Hunting down crews, like packs of bloodhounds
Snatching off crowns and melting 'em down
I once was lost, see but now I'm found
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
And when the saints come marchin' in . .

I've seen a rich man beg I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win and a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the downside of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon drank from the golden cup
And smoked the finest green
I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start

I knew this kid named Max who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain
You know it comes that way at least that's what they say when you play the game
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose

Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like to have to lose",What It's Like

Once upon a time not long ago
when people wore pyjamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
and people were behaving' like they ought to: good
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy
and this is what he said
""Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash
robbing' old folks and making' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, ""keep still, boy, no need for static""
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
the kid pulled out a gun
He said, ""Why'd you hit me?""
the barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
a shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good in expectations
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming so he made a left
he was running' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
opened up the door there, guess who he saw
Dad, the dope fiend shooting' dope
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
He rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets but still had static
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, ""back off or honey here's dead""
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
he dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
he was only nineteen, in a madman's dream
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good night!

You run, you ungrateful most hateful leech niggas
Swallow in your misery I'm out of reach niggas

They go one for the Prophet, two for Islam
Three for the Khutba from the Imam
Four for the mother that birthed my frame
Five for the father 'cause he taught me game
Been 'round the world, songs are all the same
Sometimes when I'm asleep I still call your name
Back when I was young I used to dream of fame
Now they all point they fingers saying who's to blame
Mothers put their girls into pigtail curls
Fathers teach their sons how to shoot their guns
They say, ""Boy don't never cry control your emotions
Just take it like a man, make your stand""
They say, ""Sex and violence go hand in hand""

Just hoping that the lord got some mercy to spare

Three for the angels, four for the alamin

And perfectly clean, got a Babylon feeling'
Wounds that need healing', truth need revealing'
Hands need washing' from all the dirty dealing'
From the floor to the ceiling', from the stage to the door
From the kings and the queens and the slaves and the whores
For every lost cause where the martyrs are found
That funky little sound, that make you want to get down
Somebody told me once, love makes the world go round
Now kids they carry pistols out on the playground
That profound, gone too far.
Praying to the light from a burned out star
Put your lights on, put down your crosses
It's time to tally up your wins and your losses

He's got the jeans and the bubblegoose on
There's murder on his mental
He's got the deuce deuce in his palm
And y'all know the fable, how Cain did Abel
Ever since the beginning, the world keeps spinning just like a turntable

Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire

La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la

When it's selling out back, likes to pump crack
To the fiends that be getting high
He keeps a hand on the pump, he's ready to dump
On any chump that would even try
He got a finger on the trigger, he ain't scared to pull it
Head full of liquor, boy you might catch a bullet
The hoes in the stable and drugs on the table
Everybody's sittin' round watchin' cops on the cable
Dressed like a slob, keeps his hair braided
He's never been robbed, he's only been raided
He's never known joy, the boy is so jaded
He's never been loved, he's only been hated
His soul's on ice, his heart is stone
Just another dead king rotting on his throne
With a pain that would cut you down to the bone
You're born alone, boy, you die alone

Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire

I'm gon' find me a woman that's strong
I'm gon' find me a woman that's oh so true
I got a pedestal to put her on

I found me a girl, she's sweet as good be
And everything in her world revolved all around me
I had a chance to make her mine but I was too blind to see
And now I got to let her go and pray she comes back to me

I'm gon' find me a woman that's pretty
I'm gon' find me a woman that swears I'm the one
And I'm a try not to treat her shitty

And I been thinkin' maybe that I was wrong
You been holdin' out for way too long
I get this feeling you don't want to belong

My heart's gon' break girl if I don't make you mine
What's past is past, what's done I cannot rewind
All said and done girl, so you're one of a kind

She said her name was Alabama
She from a little town outside Savannah
Where everybody talk that country grammar
She said she killed a man down in Atlanta
He beat her and he drank till he couldn't stand up
He told her that he loved her but he couldn't stand her
She caught him in his sleep, hit him with a hammger
Then she sold her car and she bought a gun
Johnny Law got her on the run
Another broken bottle and the damage done
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun

Her breathe was sweet, her eyes were pretty
She said her zodiac sign was Cancer
She was on her way to New York City
Trying to get a job there as a dancer
Then she asked if she could ride home with me
Now I'm still thinking on the answer
She pulled on love, she won't take pity
She'll break your heart if you give her the chance to
This time I've got an Uzi and it weights a ton
Johnny Law got her on the run
Another broken bottle and the damage done
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun

Lord have mercy on me for all the things I've done
I lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun
Don't forsake me Lord, I'm not the only one

Was sittin' in a pearl white Eldorado
In a gangsta lean she were revvin' the throttle
Got a sticker on the bumper say she like techano
She looked like Selena, the truth couldn't be plainer
She like a gangsta boogie, her mama calls her cookie

My friends call her a sad girl cause her man went away
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea

Sad girl living on the east side of the city
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity
Sad girl got no one to rely on
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on

I seen her at the market she was pushing a stroller
Smoking on a cigarette, drinkin' a soda
Laughin' at a joke that somebody just told her
Got her baby's name tattooed on the back of her shoulder
She looked like an angel, she talked like the devil
She looked like a stranger, she lived like a rebel

She's a sad girl, cause her man went away
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea

Hey sad girl, we can take this slow
Baby what you lookin' for, let me know
You say you want a man that can give you some dough
You say buy my babyshoes and buy him a coat
And buy my baby food to put down his throat
I won't play you like a ho, it ain't like that yo
Let me holler at you later, we can go to the show
I ain't tryna rock the boat, I'm tryna keep you afloat

I seen her at the post office mailing a letter
She couldn't send no money but she made him a sweater
She's talking on the pay phone and something upset her
I really want to hold her but I only just met her
But I could tell she'd been crying, she said she felt like dying
She never been so alone no, she gotta make it on her own though

She's a sad girl, cause her man went away

I can feel it all in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn
I can see I got a good foundation, deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul

Yo, first took breath in Hemstead, Long Island
Born American, ancestry from Ireland
You ain't knowin' me, you better stop smilin'
Ain't nothin' funny once my dummies start whilin'
You talkin' loud now all a sudden it's silent
Your premenitions say it's about to get violent
You want permission just to blink your own eyelid
I got my soldiers, everywhere they go, I win
No stick moves, ain't no cap peeling
Where I come from real men don't catch feelings
We don't rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin'
The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceiling
Mass appealin', done it since the 80's
Rock rhymes for my dogs, sing songs for my ladies
Spend money like crazy, ain't got no babies
If I don't make it in Heaven I'll run shit in Hades

Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's in my soul, soul music
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, soul music
Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul

Yo I shit on competition, spit on percussion
Beats are bone crushin', one deep I'm bum rushin'
Guns they get stuck in, someone starts buckin'
The jewels that I'm truckin' got pimps upchuckin'
You can't hold me down, you can't hold my hand
A full grown man with the one God plan

I represent the colors that never run
God bless DMC, God bless Reverend Run
R.I.P. for the JMJ
Tell BIG and Scott LaRock that we all say hey
Be like 2Pac or be like Kid N Play
Do you want to burn out or just fade away
And I can rock the mic without no delay
With my head to the ground everytime I pray
You can catch a heart attack or get blown away
Cause this type of shit happens everyday

Feel the burn, I can feel it in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul
Feel the burn, it's in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn

Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul

Just want to do what's right, but I don't know if I ever will
There's so many reasons, too many excuses
And all these prescriptions, got too many uses

I'm so lonely, it's kinda scary
This kind of lonely is making me weary
I'm so lonesome I could die

Sitting alone tonight, waiting for the sunshine
Sometimes I kneel and pray, hoping someday that you'll be mine
But she's so many miles away, I've got so many things to say
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway

Cause I'm so lonely, the sex is empty
This kind of lonely, it's so easy to tempt me
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die

Sitting alone tonight, waiting for somebody to call
Think if I'm up and died would nobody notice at all
Cause I'm so insecure, and I feel so unsure
Can't take it anymore, it's never been like this before

And I'm so lonely, I feel like crying

Calm your nerves down
Better watch how you react
Put your hands down
Back up off me woman,
Cause you might get touched back

Everyone suffers and everyone cries
Old people laugh and young people try

I think I would, if I could kill the emperor
Let's stop the war and feed the poor, let's kill the emperor
Let's stop the lies, the dead can't rise, silence every mother's cries
I think I would, if I could, kill the emperor

Yo it's like resident evil, the emperor's people don't give a mad fuck about your life
They'll fuck your wife and your kids
They've got people doing bids for being slaves to the dope that they supplying
Still they keep lying and tell you that it's some cartel
While they waiting on the heaven they're creating the hell
They rape the constitution while you wait in your cell
And for the victors go the spoils and that's oil wells
Call Orson Welles cause the worlds at war
And the front line is just outside your front door
Fuck the New York Times, Fuck CNN
And politicians that pretend to be the working mans' friend

Yo the emperor's a liar, the fields are on fire
Oil prices get higher, times about to expire

Final days are coming, get ready for trial
Americans they live in fifty states of denial
Have a coke and a smile, or some crack in a vile
You can even buy a pill to keep you hard for a while for these girls gone wild

I miss my wife and my baby girl

Pray for me and all my sins

Comin' around the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine

Time keeps draggin' on
Andthat train just keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My mama told me, son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns

But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin'
From a fancy dining car
They're probably drinking whiskey
And smoking big cigars

Well, I know I had it coming
I know I can't be free
Those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

If they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I'd probably move it just a little
Farther down the line

Far from Folsom Prison

And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow out my blues away

Where I'll wind up, even God don't know

Buck your gun kiddo, and I'll buck mine!
Cash walk the line, police are the swine
But knowledge is refined by the wise and divine
And I can break it down for the dumb and the blind

You leave a five like a junkie leaves tracks
A habit needs a home like a monkey needs backs

You got heaven up above, got hell down below

Never seen it comin', that's just part of the plan
Work the hidden hand, walk forbidden land
Do the best I can once shit hits the fan

Get high as you can, the power of a grand
Two in the bush is worth one in the hand
Could cower in the van, or burst into battle
Back in the saddle, the kid don't rattle
Don't play me, up the creek with no paddle
We don't snitch while you bitches just tattle
Poppin' off at the lip gets you tipped like cattle

Ain't no room for budgin once the law starts judgin

So you runnin wild sinnin, you're smilin and yo' grinnin
With all that trick knowledge you bought
You got the mind of a leper, and the soul of a tortured king
And it's all breakin down and that's the truly unfortunate thing
While you're fightin for survival, I'm feelin sacrificial
Got a brand new rifle girl it's government issue
Got a heart full of stone, got an eye that's about to take aim
And every fuckin person up on Twitter is gonna speak my name
'Cause they all gone stupid, they all got lazy
They worship all the money and they idolize the crazy

Gotta couple good friends with helping hands
I need a brand new job with a health care plan
They closed the plant, they stole my job
And told me crime don't pay unless you ask the mob

Watch a little tube, try to kill a little time

Standin in her pumps and her lingerie
Comment allez-vous parlez vous francais
Don't know how to act, don't know what to say
Need a genie and a wish in the very worst way
And this type of ish happens eve-ry-day
Type love I feel, is so for real
So gen-uine, and so sublime
Baby workin and puttin on a show for me
Standin over me, I smell potpourri
Take you any place that you wanna go with me
Just (come talk to me) like Jodeci

Baby girl do you really wanna feel it?
Got a lot at stake, and a promise to make
And a kiss from your lips could seal it

I'll be the one that you need
I'll be the man that will love you
I'll be there, for you babe

Relationship gone down
In a bottle of booze, you manifest your blues
Put on your face and hit the town
Now that skin-tight dress maybe might impress
The kind of man that you might not like
First time up with no luck and confusion
Got you gamblin' with just one strike
You need more than conversation and introduction calls
You need someone to catch you when you fall
And fly like an eagle when you fine
Cause you on my mind

Tryin' to show and prove, don't disturb the groove

She used to be a sinner, but now she's saved
She's well respected and she's well behaved
Her fuse is short, her legs are long
Her temper's mean, her will is strong
A love so real, a love so deep
A love so true, it's so hard to keep
Her center's sweet, her beauty's rare
When we walk down the street people stop and stare
She's so damn smart, she's one of a kind
She's a work of art, she's a priceless wine
She's a drama queen, she's a friend of mine
She's every man's dream and she's mine all mine

Her aim was true, her heart was pure
Until the day that her daddy walked out the door
She's lookin' for a man and so much more
But her Uncle Sam sent him off to war

She love the paparazzi, she's tryin' to sell her story
She's gonna write a movie, she wanna be a star
But Little Miss America, where did you get that scar?

Desert sun, blazin' sand
Love in my heart, gun in my hand
Lost a leg, killed a man
in mortal combat, hand to hand
Saw men killed, watched men die
so many times that I can't cry
It's been eighteen months since I've seen home
I get a purple heart, a good G.I. Loan
They say God blesses every child with his own
But we're all gonna die in the dark alone

Lay your head in my lonely arms
No surprises, no alarms

Tell me when it went bad 
How to get back to the times that we had 

We're both young 
And our spirits are old 
Now we're just angry and we act like we're old 
We can't even talk it out without one of us walking away 

You were eighteen I just turned twenty nine

Knew how it feels 
Knew it how aches

Hit a few bumps

Gotta be strong

Hunger so much for one person to care

Hope is a dream 
Hope is a drug 
Maybe hope's a vaccine

I curse the lord 
Offer them everything I can afford

Kicked all of my highs

It's gotta be that way

I need a new today
Won't you

From the selfishness that keeps me far from you
Hold me
'til I know I hear You say 
You're not looking for perfection
Just a willingness is fine
You will always have my attention
You just wanna hear me say

How did I get here stuck in the middle
I wanna do right
But its easier to think about only me
It could only be
Can I wake up from this life that I'm livin'
Tell me again that it's all forgiven
What You see in me

Funny how you try to hold so tight
The more it slips away
The closer that you look

With no line, you'll get lost this time
If you don't know where you're going

Its okay, okay to change
Its time you started growing

So there I stood without a clue
My head tried tell me what to do
My heart started playing tug-of-war
Like it's out of my hands

[Chorus]
To be fearless when I'm scared to move
I'm overdue
Daring to be different
To scream yes, yeah I'm awake
I will not break
Daring to, daring to be different

The whole world tells me
If I choose wrong
I won't belong
I better make the right decision
But what they do and
What they say
Are not the same
They're a spinning contradiction

It's just the old that they call new
Dizzy from all the points of view
Closing my eyes while breathing in
Look up, let go, no hands

Yeah I'm faded, my true colour's gone

I don't wanna be your little picture perfect pretty girl
Who's got nothing to say
I'm not gonna wait around

Words like music in my ear
We had it going on, but something's wrong

You feel a million miles away

What's going on, what's going on?

'Cause every time I try to talk to you
I end up feeling so confused
Like you can't hear a word I'm saying

I'm having trouble getting through
I can't stand it, it's so tragic
I feel static between us

You turn your back, then you take my hand
It's getting hard to understand
Is it you, is it me?
Is it time or space you need?

When you're here, you're not around

If I say goodbye to you will I get through?
Will I get through?

I'm still waiting for you to be who you have promised
Waiting, I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting for you to show you love me

We laughed, we talked, we played together
But the time spent in between
Was way too long
Why am I so amazed
Whenever I don't hear from you
The truth is you're the same
As you've always been

It's hard to believe you have to prove it 
But when you ignore something you lose it
So don't be surprised to find that I'm already gone

I don't want to hear you say
That you never meant to hurt me

Then I will leave this battlefield

Good or bad depends on your point of view
And I can see things from both sides
Just one more classic case of catch-22
Things don't have a simple truth

So you ask where this is leading me
Only I don't have an answer yet

Seeing things black and white is for the weak
I'm strong enough for shades of grey
While searching for the perfect compromise
I am driven to despair

So my thoughts are spinning around
For I know my problem well
And I wonder, will I ever get
Out of this carousel

You are trying in vain
To reach me with your hands
But all that I can say
Is I hope you understand

So I am caught between the chairs again
While everybody else does fine

It's just my nature to move back and forth
Always trying not to offend
I cannot decide whether to refuse
Or to reach out for your helping hand

So my thoughts are spinning around
For I know my problem well
And I wonder, will I ever get
Out of this carousel

You are trying in vain
To reach me with your hands
But all that I can say
Is I hope you understand

Meanwhile I'm trying to make up my mind
Feeling like I'm paralysed
What's the sense of it all, is it...

Because of you and I
Because of fear
Or just because of all
That I wish to have near
It's about really stupid things
But they keep growing until
They seem to tear me apart

So my thoughts are spinning around
For I know my problem well
And I wonder, will I ever get
Out of this carousel

You are trying in vain
To reach me with your hands
You ask for explanations
Until things make sense
Well, I don't have any
So all that I can say is
I hope you understand

It is because you and I
Because of fear
Because of all
That I wish to have near

It's about really stupid things
Of no major size
But they keep on growing
Until a part of me dies

Everon,"Here in this night
In the darkest of hours
I feel a cold wind that tells
Of a storm front drawing near

It speaks of greed and of hunger
Of envy and dread
Tells of the anger and hate
That arose from the fear

Who said life's easy
Who said life's fair
Who said good luck will be with those who dare

To follow their heart, and not follow their fear
And if the good all die young
Then who are all those still here

Take a look around you
See what you've got
You just see what you don't have
And of that you still have a lot

The sky is the limit
The sky's not enough
The tough keep going
Not only when the going gets rough

It seems we all
Don't worry much
About what is happening
Left and right of us

But even if I try my hardest
Not to care
One question remains
And I'd like to hear your answer

Acting on target
At robotic speed
Recklessly feeding
Your robotic needs

No minute wasted
Emotions refused
Your brain's exploited
Your heart remains unused

It seems we all...
Name your price
How much is it to buy your loyalty
I'll do so, if I can afford

Name your price
How much do you charge to show remorse
To throw your indifference overboard

Won't you once
Think just a little while about
What you will leave behind
When you decease

Won't you once
Just once be good for something
Good for someone
Good for yourself at least

Everon,"So what you're really trying to say
Is you don't want me to stand in your way
Is that all that you feel right now

My Dear, I wish that you would understand
Sometimes things just go out of hand
And some things just happen somehow

For a shred of hope you would follow the devil
For a sense of bliss you would sell all of your dreams
For a trace of love we may lose mind completely
And there is not a lot that we can do

Is there nothing that we could do...

Are we caught up in that river's flow
And for every new way that we go
Do we have to leave something behind

My Dear, it's that river that gives and that takes
So for every new turn that it makes
We lose one thing but another we find

For a shred of hope...

How many times did I wish I could just end this pain
That I could go back in time
To where it began and then start again

Well, if we could so, it would be so easy to make amends
But the river doesn't stand still
And the river just gives no second chance

Is there nothing that we could do...

I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side

Every Avenue,"We saw the summer night
We drank down the sober sky
Left our mark into the concrete
Burned up all our tires sleeping

Words flow as we are fading
Watch the canvas become our painting
Not all roads lead to Rome
'Cause this one leads to the hell back home and

Oh oh, this is what we do
Oh oh, this is what we do

You can say, it's wasted ignorance
But we're okay, just living in the wreckage
Don't you get the wrong impression
It's just business with the worst intentions

We felt the floor fall out
And well, I guess it's too late now
Guess that we'll just count our losses
Fix it no matter what the cost is

Lie down with a view
Fell asleep on top of the roof
Remember when the sky turned orange
Or was it black the night before?

Oh oh, this is what we do
Oh oh, this is what we do, whoa

You can say, it's wasted ignorance
But we're okay, just living in the wreckage
Don't you get the wrong impression

Now we're waking up to AM radio
I felt my fingers but I couldn't keep from laughing
Your body language said you knew that this would happen

I'm digging a hole for the days of the old
I'll put them two feet deep so I can reach 'em if I need 'em
Fingerprints show on the walls of my home
Buried, and turn off the radio, turn off the radio

I will always remember
Making out 'til the sun went down
Counting stars from the hood of a car
Catching my friends as they were falling down

Rise and shine to a headache and a question
My keys were lost and my morals came up missing
Opportunities were open for the taking
I tried to leave but couldn't keep the floors from shaking

Digging a hole from the days of the old
I'll put them two feet deep so I can reach 'em if I need 'em
Fingerprints show on the walls of my home
Buried, and turn off the radio, turn off the radio

I will always remember
Making out 'til the sun went down
Counting stars from the hood of a car
Catching my friends as they were falling down

Take me back to the ocean
Right before we had to drive away
We made a promise when we said goodbye
We swore it wouldn't be the last time

This is where the summer ends
No more clothes left dry in the sand
It was good, no, it was amazing
Tell me that you won't, won't forget about me

I will always remember
Making out 'til the sun went down
Counting stars from the hood of a car
Catching my friends as they were falling down

Come on and take me on a sinking ship
What's death without a smile
I still want you on the bottom of the ocean
Watch me bury the ground after you get yours

The way she moved her lips away, drove me insane
And now I'm left here in the wake of something more

She made it hard to leave as she stood by the door
In a V-neck T-shirt and nothing more
Than a single tear rolling down her cheek, whoa

Don't go away again
I wanna be more than a phone call at 4 a.m.
Seems like every time you come back home
It's just to steal my heart and leave

Don't go away again
I wanna be more than a story to tell your friends
Seems like every time you come back home
It's just to make me fall again

It's getting hard, I know, believe me I feel you
And I can't fall asleep knowing you're not home
Is it too much to ask, can't you just pick up the phone?

We've had our share of fights
I know it's not easy when I'm never home
I have my own dreams
Like you have your life planned out back home

Don't go away again

Seems like every time you come back home

Don't go away again
I wanna be more than a story to tell your friends
Seems like every time you come back home

And time will always stand between us
And hold you so high
Just enough to watch you fade

As I lay awake in some far off city
Pretend you're lying next to me
Eyes wide open, dreaming of you

Don't go away again

Keep your mouth moving but your body still
You'll never hit the target if you're shooting empty shells

And take a step back, take a step back
Hold on tighter

They said we'd never make it this far
Well, look at us now
We've found our way

Life is what you make of it, so maybe your own faults
Wonder what we could bend
Looking back on all of this, I wanna know I made the best
Saving my rest for the grave

Pulling out of pockets to show what we got
Asleep at the wheel, dreaming and driving
Rather hit rock bottom than be stuck second guessing
They have the answers but they don't know the questions

Come on, let's make something happen
We'll make mistakes and not learn our lessons

I've got you turning blue
We can't put down our pride

When did we think that this would be easy?
We must have been out of our minds
We were holding so tight
It just slipped through our fingers but we won't let go

Holding your breath just to pass the time
Don't fill an empty space with the same conversation
I feel your words right behind your kiss
The taste of your lips should be enough

Looking for a good time;
Of all the numbers you end up calling mine.
Ready or not , I think I'll give this a shot.
I should know better than to
Give her what she wants.
I picked her up and she was three-forths gone.
She passed out before we even got to talk.
All I want to know is:

Where were you when I needed you most?
Why did you leave me alone?
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
And I don't understand.

Back to where we left off, baby.
'How you been and what's been new with you lately?'
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround.
You build me up just to let me down.

Down.

Where were you when I needed you most?
Why did you leave me alone?
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
And I don't understand.

And everyone's saying, ""Shape up and get a life""

I gotta settle down in place just like the rest?
Living the dream, is this what it feels like?

Making James Dean speeches to an empty room.

The dead men talking are longing for so much more than simply the obvious. Cut us off. We're suffering, hysterical, lighting flares from the foot of her bed. I've been begging you for less mercy than this. But the only thing you need to know is that you never wanted to know. Take it off, take it back, or take cover because we're nearing a nerve. Dead is wasted on the patient so make haste and head for the wake. Now the hornets inhabit the hearts we've abandoned. We are gone. Cast aside our clothes like funeral roses, and dance straight through the psalm. I'm dead in the water. Don't come for me. I was once alive in the deserts eyes on the day it wed the sea. I drew a chalk outline around your city. Hushed the sobs in your halls. But we both know it's killer, baby he'll outrun them all. There is so much shame in how little we've gained for so long. Now the sky is falling. And you're just repeating every word I say. You are not listening close enough. It's a catastrophe. You have not been concentrating. Pay attention there will be an exam

I can’t see the road ahead
I have taken too much
Once a ladder, now a crutch
When all of it is closing in
Stop fighting and hold your breath
So much self-love, so much hate
Fuck these people, fuck this place

But to an amateur set of eyes
Me and the lord look a lot alike
I might even have a brilliant shine and the strength to make it right

Unbroken, unscarred
Back ain’t weak, hands ain’t hard
It’s the first night in town
Our first night in town

Rain comes down, bridge goes out
The same way it always did

Now that I’m yours, discover me
Now that I’m yours, unbury me
Now that I’m yours, amaze me
Go ahead and save me, go ahead

I’m standing in the way again
I can’t see the road ahead
Don’t take it back, you’re all that I have

A new goddess emerged from the mist
And took the blade from my wrist
Don’t blink back out
I will aimlessly wander this wasteland
Guided only by a sickness, not a purpose
I can’t go back to what I was
Metallica without the drugs
A faith healer without the plant

When will you wake up and see (wake up and see)

And it seems like I can't do anything to help you.
But I'm doing it all wrong.
I don't wanna be here anymore,

I said I'm not giving it to you this time It's for God,

Nothing more, and I think I'll be fine.

Not a place in your face that you cannot see,
Back up your face are you talking, yea,
I said it's grace, He will be with me every place.

And everybody says you go with your flow and everybody knows,
And everybody sings and everybody brings it.
You go and everybody says it, you go and everybody throws it,

You go and everybody fakes it one time, and everybody shows it,
One time and everybody throws it, one time and everybody goes it,
One time and everybody blows it.
Here we go, come on.

Come on man tell me what you were thinking,
Doing everything with a selfish reason.
I didn't meant to be the one to cut in,
But you gotta stop and think about what you're doing.

You sang your song way out of tune, so step off now and let it loose,
I'm not gonna do it your way!  I'm doing it for God, so I'm here today.
Everybody goes and everybody knows,

Upon a beach that came my way
And every time it seemed the same
And everywhere I looked the sun was dying
Walked back down the avenue
I left a girl that I knew was true
But every time I get one
Well, I choke up - I don't know what I'm doing
Tried to clear my empty head
Of thoughts and words that were never said
Sat alone and heard my drone
And wondered when the wind would change direction
It answered me so pleasantly
The vision that I tried to see
Walked away, felt my sway
And prayed to God for a little bit of salvation

Spent a long time getting over you

Trying not to listen to your lies

Oh, but it's hard when you leave me on the shelf

You say, I set a path for you to follow
And I've already given in
But I only meant for you to taste, not swallow
Where I end is where you must begin

Try not to listen to their lies
Try just to keep hold of yourself
Oh, I know it's hard when they leave you on their shelf

She's such a sweet girl free of the taints of this world
Think that's a compliment, don't be so full of sentiment
Why you worship sweetness? What virtue's there in weakness?

Everything But the Girl,"I won't try to stop you
When you speak of the past
Doubt is over now
And I can join in when you laugh
Fascination makes us ask for more
Than we'd like to know
I needn't explain
I think you know

Reassure me when my heart's
Not bold enough to bear her name
If you were in my shoes
And scared I would do the same
And though I may ask
There's no need for past details
For though I may laugh aloud
My courage fails
Did you know?

See how I've changed now
My head's so clear
Still there are some things
That I don't want to hear
There must be so much I know
That you cannot forget
And I mustn't wish your life began
The day we met

Places we go remind you
Of when you were here before
So you talk and tell me
You don't think about it anymore
There is something I know
Hasn't quite been left behind
So I'll ask you once again
To prove that I don't mind
To prove that I don't mind

You're all dressed up in blue
I been watching you awhile
Maybe you been watching me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well if you're looking for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe on their arm
Some girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo
Well 'round here baby
I learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

The road is dark
And it's a thin thin line
But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time
Maybe your other boyfriends
Couldn't pass the test
Well if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Well it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well I don't know baby maybe you've been around too

Up there o the top of the tree. 

And I never, no I never ever realised.

With a key that´s too big for my hands

How much can you withstand? 

The wasted time, the money spent, 
A sign that reads ´For Sale or Rent´.

Am I walking to you? 
Am I walking to you?

Am I just walking to you? 

It was seven years ago to the day, 
You rang my house and we met halfway. 
We walked round Leicester Square and 
Sat through ´Being There´ and every moment I replay. 

And I was desperate for love to be pure, 
Though what that meant, I never was sure. 
You spent your time on me, 
I took it willingly, 
And I made you trust in literature.

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, honey
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
Didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love

Cause there you stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say how I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them
Slap on the map of my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love

Do you want me back? Do you want me back?
And do I like being single?
Am I coming back? Am I coming back?

I'll put my suitcase here for now
I'll turn the TV to the bed
But if no one calls and I don't
Speak all day, do I disappear?

And look at me without you
I'm quite proud of myself
I feel reckless, clumsy
Like I'm making a mistake

Do you want me back? Do you want me back?

Seen somehow in a different light, not as wrong , but not as right as they seemed before.
Was I different then?
Have I changed?
And will I change again?

And say I did forget and revert to the old days, forget this hurt.
Am I better off or in reverse, untaught by experience and therefore worse?

Everything But the Girl,"I dreamed about you again last night.
You never have the same face twice,
But I always know it's you,
And you're always looking better than you really do.

Than you really do.
And I walk around the whole next day
Feeling like I've still got something to say.
But I don't know what it is,

And I don't know how to reach you even if I did.
Even if I did.
Do I want to hear that you forgive me?
Do I want to hear you're no good without me?

Am I big enough to hear that you never even think about me?
Why should you ever think about me?
And I thought that I'd outgrow this kind of thing.
Tell me, aren't we supposed to mature or something?

I haven't found that yet, is this as grown-up as we ever get?
Maybe this is as good as it gets.
And years may go by, but I think the heart remains a child.
The mind may grow wise, but the heart just sulks and it whines and remains a child.

Come on girl, it's alright now.
Come on girl, it's gonna be alright now.

Well I guess some boys adored me 
But the one I loved ignored me,
And caused me in the end to murder my best friend.

And though I got her letter, it never did get better,
And I got out of my head.
Then I joined a band instead.

We lay down on the lawn,
And counted until dawn,

Everything But the Girl,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind?

And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it?s wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule?

As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in

I believe in love, Alfie

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

What's the difference between you and me?
Open up your eyes and see
That, it's, nothing

Head and skin are alike inside
Follow yourself, not other's self pride
Be what you are and nothing else
And in time only it will tell
Prejudice is just a stupid fad
The ignorant children shouldn't have
Just go away and take your shit
Cause your ignorance feeds their prejudice

Racial wars are never won

Shouting gun on they run through the endless grey on they fight for the right

For a hill men would kill why they do not know 
Stiffened wounds test their pride 
Men of five still alive through the raging glow gone insane from the pain that 
They'll surely know

Time marches on 
For Whom the Bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die, its the last time you will 
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky, shattered goal fills the 
Soul with a ruthless cry 
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery, hears the silence so loud 
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be. 
Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see...

Michael Connelly reminded me with Echo Park
Of days of hoppin' on the metro, when they let those spark
Back when I collected retro art
And since then many a dearly departed God bless they heart
God bless they hearts, harder living in Kane
Where the sun and the rain became one in the same
I took it as a lesson I was still learnin'
I'm still the will of the '84 torch burnin'
I been through heartbreaks to breakups to makeups to broke again
Not back again, my soul on the rope again
Took the jacket off and saw blood on my sleeves
When you wear your heart there, this the puddle it leaves 
(I don't need love) It's the rebuttal of thieves
And chicks with crooks like you, so what'll it be?
She steal your heart, now she runnin' the streets
Don't need the pain, man, troublin' me

I don't need love
I don't, I don't need love

While Kanye was chasing spaceships all over the nation
I was at the grave site, face on the pavement
Left college dropout, first flight racing
From Scranton, Pennsylvania on a prop plane praying
Heart 'bout to pop out my chest in Pittsburgh
Paranoid in first class, heard a voice, whisper (Real talk)
Just touched back in LAX and my phone starts buzzin' to one thousand texts 
Out the gate and runnin' like I'm motorless

I still love you explained if you don't know the rest
I would say that's when love became an issue
Anybody treated me good, that's when I diss you
A certain chick who caught the bad end of the stick
And through thin and thick I still miss you
I've trashed every girl I've had since
Warm heart, cold mind is absent, imagine
I don't need love anymore, I need pressure
Pain, my veins feelin' so electric
Blue in the skin, choosin' my sin
'Til the same sins doin' me in I don't need love

Proof is in the pudding
I'm pressed up and labeled Evidence

But never chasing fame, dragons, chicks, or dead presidents
Dreams, but never snatch chains of any measurements
Because of my name, for every fuckin' crime they find the relevance
Choices in my life that I want to correct
I got voices in my head that I want to forget
Uh and I don't live with regret
But I've been living with a chick while other chicks try to text

Yeah, my first album only had underground appearances
So what's the outcome, I'm still an underground lyricist
And fame don't even capture what my interest is
I'm halfway to famous, halfway away from infamous
My naked eyes are like my memory chips
Everything digested comes up when I spit
I say so be it without a whistle, call it how I see it (Yeah)

Whether in my boundaries or in another region
I'm speeding on the highway with my girl shotty
Keep a plant in my car, like Good Friday
Keep my world Godly I stay grounded like my lobby
Aging bucket on the wall but never tat it on my body
My music and my graf are livin' separate lives
One gets me paid, the other's payin' the price
Either way they'll say I'm spraying at night

He mispronounced it, Evidence, fast forward
Here we are, standing in the present tense

'Cause counting sheep is as easy as 1 2
Jumping out the nest to catch some bird food
Clutch so intense that the knuckles turn blue

Check horizons, read the flight plan
Spread the lifespan
Sky heights are set, it's time to climb these steps
We only try to get free from the spider's web
Gotta murder all the messing around
Carry the burden of work, never setting it down
With a spot like now, my shot, my chance
Put a plot of land in the pockets of my pants

Break loose, raise roof when the kick drops
They flew, straight through, no pit stops
Lift off with your head in the clouds

Slash rap notable
Slash mic on the ? still controlling you
I'm rarely candid, my view panoramic
My eyes wide shut, if not one, I'm holding two
I'm packing double, getting up too early
I'm actually trouble, kind of acting 7: 30
Attracted to this Earth, maybe acting kinda worldly
But running on my work that says ""Ev I better hurry""
I'd rather worry death than being pushed in the line
Still a perfect ?, never late when I fly
Epic ? so this time when I rhyme
Not an ounce of death dying, stay late to the sky
Late for my prime, something that was shaped by design
I been running while the others hurt from racing a line
Making it great coincides with making it mine
Coincides with the hate that I'm making in signs
Let me start from the beginning, I rewind to the top
Pitch my heart in every inning like I did with the ?
And it don't stop, a body in motion stays in motion
Coasting in between the wings of this flowing

From a chicken wire frame
And a house of wax
To a rocket exploding into a cloud of bats

They say old soul with kids energy
Steals off of my torso with enemies
By any means, I've seen what it's worth
A curse, snakes and centipedes is venomous
Seems the only safe place is Venice Beach
Try to wrong my rights, try to right my wrongs
Try to write my songs

Daybreak becomes the encore
Can't tell the day to stay because I'm on tour

Evidence,"I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existed
My patience led the way until the greatest love listened to me
I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches
It's like the sixth man, sits on different benches
It's hard squeezing life in a sentence
And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint
My entrance is what's between

When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene
Alchemist cut the record down to the bone
And with a record like this I take the world by storm
Sky blessed, the land of the brave
Understand where I stand, my hand is made
From B R double-O K-lyn in the planet
Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became

Panic on my first campaign, but when the words fell to place
I was certain to reign, I hit the purple, 
Then step in the circle and start flexin'
Weatherman invented, now storms change directions
Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now
I always shared pretty good for an only child
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong

Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on
They on welfare, you got health care
They used to have their priorities elsewhere
I took rims and tires and traded them
For a ticket to an island, that's where
I wrote this rhyming where I first saw my vision
Buy a better living, a place to raise kids in

So I think like I rule the world
On the brink of something bigger, building schools
For boys and girls the thought of home gets me out of my bed
I said you got them tools? 
Get them shits up out of the shed, come on 

I'm like the interstate of rhyming the Jack Dempsey emcee
All my shit costumed out eventually money is made, fly blades
A woman with brains, a black nigga reign
My lifestyle as a prowler a rich owner, loaner
Used to pump at coffees shops had my bitch 
Who sell with me rolling up fly ass and still classy
Asking questions like, ""Why you wait on that glass?

Why you splash me?"" Yo, it's only nigga shit
I'mma teach you like how I was taught too
Hold the phone, ward two, seeing all kinds of great fossils
Colossal juice, ? the house, act fly
Got you, no need to walk backwards, fuck with the taxes 
I speak credibility, the story to másses
Yo, a diplomatic winner, Nike boots
A scully good denim jean on and ?

They say you only live once, I disagree
You only live twice, your life enable your seed's
So I lean on blacks and feed em the deeds
So when I die they got a foundation on my publishing B
Plus the words that I speak, plus my family jewels
It ain't all blood diamonds, but ? experienced fools
And I be rhyming cool, but my philosophy's deep
Like a dear John letter, so read em and weep

And the wolf smells blood, you can feed em to me
We can meet in the street, draw heat, but what happened to peace?
He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech
Jesus, diarrhea, I mean holy shit
Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit
Communion had the wine, made the sign of the cross
And I will live in the past, chalk it up as a loss
Went from ""Please listen to my demo!"" to stretch limo

To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel
But I can't go out like Timbo slice
Like Geena Korrano, a cyborg determinate
Mano a mano, still Ronald McDonald over one billion served

Evidence,"If it's one thing I've learned that I've written down on paper
It's never leave some weed on the table with a stranger
Shit, I could barely even trust my friends
Maybe with my lady, not trees of the mends
I mean really why even should I try and test it socially
Catch them in the act and end up having to approach them
Entertain the story while it's testing on my patience
Why the fuck you think I spent this money on some ?

While I'm on the other side of Earth without assistance
Hitchin' in the night sayin' Evy goes the distance
At home the same shit is goin' on, I don't miss it
It's a nice place to live, but I wouldn't wanna visit
Never steppin' out the car or on the stage without a purpose
Ghost-ride the whip like I'm ghost writing verses
Afraid to come and go so I take fame in little doses
Director of these photos so the aim remains focused
Hold still right there, hold still

I ain't holier than though or tryin' to even act superior
Half the shit I rap about I'm speaking from experience

That merits all the lows to terrace highs and travel

That I'mma let Rev kill while I chill on the rhyme

I ain't speakin' on my businesses in public when concerning deals
Steppin' on stage like it's lightbulbs or turning wheels
In spite a couple nights of a thousand I didn't kill
I still kept it peelin' out and steppin' up for Reverend Real
Messages across the board are still remaining pinned up
The opposite of dilated eyes that I begin with
Nothin' is original even under cloudy days 
Sun is still shining just rerouted and out of phase
Lately when I walk I've been trying to hold my posture straight
Hold my chin up then feel the love from across the way
California love from Diego to across the bay
All across the map to every single solitary state
All across the baggage claim, all across the gate

Some callin' it fate while some others remain torn
Some callin' it rain cause that's when I brainstorm",Strangers

Each word is the church and minister
Approach, I coerce the listener so listen up
Kicking park bench rhythms up till I visual a flow

Lines undone, half uncompleted

I spit that fly for now and feel it when it's live
Move the crowd, got tools for the reddest eyes
Getting cabbage my man until the letters dry
I'm fully up to the task to pull the woolly over my face
Into a masked location, don't even ask
It's like damn another day in the life
Like keep waking up from the previous night
Vacation, I don't take it often
I see parking lot stages and buses with bunks like coffins
Clear customs with weed in my Levis

Ewan MacColl,"In the morning we built the city 
In the afternoon walked through its streets 
Evening saw us leaving 

We wandered through our days as if they would never end 
All of us imagined we had endless time to spend 
We hardly saw the crossroads and small attention gave 
To landmarks on the journey from the cradle to the grave, 
cradle to the grave, cradle to the grave 

Did you learn to dream in the morning? 
Abandon dreams in the afternoon? 
Wait without hope in the evening? 

Did you stand there in the traces and let 'em feed you lies? 
Did you trail along behind them wearing blinkers on your eyes? 
Did you kiss the foot that kicked you, did you thank them for 
their scorn? 
Did you ask for their forgiveness for the act of being born, 
act of being born, act of being born? 

Did you alter the face of the city? 
Make any change in the world you found? 
Or did you observe all the warnings? 

Did you read the trespass notices, did you keep off the grass? 
Did you shuffle up the pavements just to let your betters pass? 
Did you learn to keep your mouth shut, were you seen but never heard? 
Did you learn to be obedient and jump to at a word, 
jump to at a word, jump to at a word? 

Did you demand any answers? 
The who and the what and the reason why? 
Did you ever question the setup? 

Did you stand aside and let 'em choose while you took second best? 
Did you let 'em skim the cream off and give to you the rest? 
Did you settle for the shoddy and did you think it right 
To let 'em rob you right and left and never make a fight, 
never make a fight, never make a fight? 

What did you learn in the morning? 
How much did you know in the afternoon? 
Were you content in the evening? 

Did they teach you how to question when you were at the school? 
Did the factory help you, were you the maker or the tool? 
Did the place where you were living enrich your life and then 
Did you reach some understanding of all your fellow men, 
all your fellow men, all your fellow men? ",Ballad of Accounting

May it bring you light and warmth and the pleasure of giving

I've camped by the Waynestones as well
I've sunbathed on Kinder, been burned to a cinder

The heather has oft been me bed

The day was just ending and I was descending
Down Grinesbrook just by Upper Tor
When a voice cried ""Hey you"" in the way keepers do
He'd the worst face that ever I saw
The things that he said were unpleasant
In the teeth of his fury I said
""Sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead""

He called me a louse and said ""Think of the grouse""
Well i thought, but I still couldn't see
Why all Kinder Scout and the moors roundabout
Couldn't take both the poor grouse and me
He said ""All this land is my master's""
At that I stood shaking my head
No man has the right to own mountains
Any more than the deep ocean bed

I once loved a maid, a spot welder by trade
She was fair as the Rowan in bloom
And the bloom of her eye watched the blue Moreland sky
I wooed her from April to June
On the day that we should have been married
I went for a ramble instead
For sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

So I'll walk where I will over mountain and hill
And I'll lie where the bracken is deep
I belong to the mountains, the clear running fountains
Where the grey rocks lie ragged and steep
I've seen the white hare in the gullys
And the curlew fly high overhead
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead.",The Manchester Rambler

They killed him, my old man

And my advice to you, my son
Is to fight back while you can
Watch out for the man with the silicon chip
Hold on to your job with a good firm grip

The hour when wounded night begins to bleed
Stands at the back of the patient queue
The silent almost sweeping queue
Seein' no-one and not being seen

Working shoes are wrapped in working apron
Rolled in an oilcloth bag across her knees
The swaying tremor soaks the morning
Blue grey steely day is dawning
Draining the last few dregs of sleep away

Over the bridge and the writhing foul black water
Down through empty corridors of stone

Shows her twin in sudden flashes
Which is the mirror image, which is real?

Crouching hooded gods of word and number?
Accept her bent-backed homage as their due
The buckets steam like incense coils
Around the endless floor she toils
Cleaning the same white sweep each day anew

Glistening sheen of new-washed floors is fading
There where office clocks are marking time
Night's black tide has ebbed away
By cliffs of glass awash with day
She hurries from her labours still unseen

He who lies besides her does not see her
Nor does the child who once lay at her breast
The shroud of self-denial covers
Eager girl and tender lover
Only the faded servant now is left

And the treatment, sure it took some bearing
There was little kindness and the kicks were many

With a hundred cran of silver darlings

Que eu não sou um moleque atrevido
Ganhei minha fama de bamba
No samba de roda

Fico feliz em saber
O que fiz pela música

Também somos linha de frente
De toda essa história

Nós somos do tempo do samba
Sem grana, sem glória
Não se discute talento
Nem seu argumento
Me faça o favor

Respeite quem pode chegar
Onde a gente chegou
E a gente chegou muito bem
Sem desmerecer a ninguém

Enfrentando no peito um certo preconceito
E muito desdém
Hoje em dia é fácil dizer
Essa música é nossa raiz

Tá chovendo de gente
Que fala de samba
E não sabe o que diz
Por isso vê lá onde pisa
Respeite a camisa que a gente suou

Respeite quem pode chegar
Onde a gente chegou
E quando chegar no terreiro procure primeiro
Saber quem eu sou

Respeite quem pode chegar
Onde a gente chegou

She don't expect pendants or remnants or necklaces
She only wants to trust me and don't want to fuss me

But I just dig myself into a hole and she goes berserk

Would break down when we fell and behave like we're 10?

Hiding out paranoia sets in, evil runs through my veins
Suicide, the last resort wake up I'm going insane

He marked your soul with evil
Out on the streets

Under your hair three sixes appear
You were sent to do his task
But your death grows nearer and nearer
You know your life is fading fast

You are born to die
You are born to die
You are born to die
You are, you are born to die

The youth flock to your side
But your mission you must hide
If you live your life
You will rule empires with fire
You will hold unearthly power
To conquer all in sight
But when they find you
They will destroy you
The final fight

You are born to die

You're living evil tonight
Terrorizing all in sight
You make the banshee cry
'Cause you were born to die

Before you know it
They're coming to get you
Time it takes it's toll on you
Marked by the devil living his power
Armageddon was always true
You'll meet the ruler face to face
To be slain by the knives of God
Your blood will flow through the caverns of Earth
Back to hell your soul will go

On the day you die
You'll demand death to all
Three days of darkness
And the world cracks and faults
Under the cross your shadow appears
With the knives shoved deep as you burn
Thunder cracks the sky
As you scream from hell ""I shall return""

Burning at a constant pace
Destruction of time is awaited
The end of a civilized place

The heat and the suffering minds
Equipped for sudden impact
But never for one of this kind

Heat burns to kill
The night is black and still
Look to the sky
Don't ask why

Nations must wait in fear
The ending of time is so near
Your future and your destination
As shot the battles are here

Can the masters rebuild it?
The blackened waste left behind
Equipped for sudden impact
But never for one of this kind

Heat burns to kill

Equipped for sudden impact
But never for one of this kind

Burning all us to the ground

As I climb from the depths of my shelter
I look with a feeling of hate
This world has turned to a wasteland
Nothing left to replace

Man has made and destroyed it

The omen, the final sign

As the sleeps closes in

Like a force in my head
It wants me dead

My God it knows what I'm feeling
Then I wake up screaming

I'm lost in the black
My nightmares attack
The thing that I fear
Is knowing he's near

The force in my brain
Puts pressure again
I dream of the spell
That cursed me to hell

My God it knows what I'm feeling
Then I wake up screaming

Take a look down
It's waiting there
Everywhere I turn
It's waiting to burn my soul

As the light turns to dark
I'm falling apart
These nightmares I've had
Are driving me mad

The final time
It enters my mind
It cries for revenge
I know it's the end

My God it knows what I'm feeling
Then I wake up screaming
There's no where left to run
The fading of the sun
There's no returning back
From the dreams that I now have
Voices of demons
Shouting out with laughter
Now I'm screaming in pain
My heart is pounding faster

I'm crying out with fear
Satan laughs he's nearer
Is it now my time
Has he possessed my mind?
Has he come to live in me
To crucify and bury me?
He knows the terror I'm feeling
Then I wake up screaming

From rock and roll
Don't you ever tell them we're more than a

Attacked by forces blown to the ground
We're an army like soldiers more than a

Exciter,"On this night the ritual begins
Unholy terror deadly sin
The witching hour is growing near
The stroke of midnight the strike of fear

With sacred knife held tight in your hand
The maiden lies beneath where you stand
Mystic chants command you this night
She's a victim of sacrifice

Witches burn in hell
Dead men don't live to tell
Of torture and evil rights
They're victims of sacrifice

We are the victims burned at the stake
All of the innocent died in your place
Black magic rules the deep within your heart
I'll take your soul and I'll tear it apart

Crosses mark the space
Where terror took its place
Witches rule the night
When evil takes its bite

You're the sinner you're the fool
You have the power to break the rules
Your day is coming you wait and see
You'll burn in fire like the others and me

Walk into the circle candles at your feet
Resurrected now submission is weak
I'll raise the dead who's blood you'll drink
You know it's too late now later than you think

The nearer you get to hell
Witches cast their spells
The chosen pay the price
Like victims of sacrifice

Coming to retrieve the human forms

Steal the power from their eyes

High priests pray to their one above

Exhorder,"Here's a tale in history
About a period of tragedy 
A man who thought of horrid things
But really sought what happiness brings 
Terror instilled within the souls
Of men and women, young and old 
Come and listen to me, my friend 
He'll make your morale descend 

One Boston day, it's sad to say
A newborn child was granted miserable life 
Abandoned by his father and
Left alone by death of father's wife 

Foster child 
Tobacco exporter gave him a chance 
History defiled 
Twisted by literature, dark and opium enhanced 
Irregularity 
So far ahead of his time 
A spark of a breed
Regarding all of his literature creed 

Infamy of tales and poetry 
Connecting his themes to his wildest dreams 

The maelstrom grew but no one knew 
He descended far beyond its spinning walls 
Into the pit, the black abyss 
His house was collapsing as he searched for El Dorado 

Perched upon Pallas was life, hard and callous
The shadows of burden lifted nevermore 
The vulture eye of death concealed
By wooden planks below the floor 
The quest for solace evolved into sorrow 
Lingering obsessions 
Intoxication, stimulation, creation 
Hindering addictions 

Apparently the message in a bottle was lost
For I could see no conclusion 
But all of us remaining in the shrouded past
Must remember to further ourselves by obtrusion 

Inebriated grin leads the mighty pen
Across the paper as his fears come alive 
Satiric whim ignites the brim
Of insanity as Pluto arrives 
Swaying cognac barriers
And the beating of his hideous heart
Increasing ever so constantly 
Conjuring the ne'er forgotten lore 
'Tis only this and nothing more",The Tragic Period

Escape from brainwashed winds and pollution

Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
Where the sons of freedom make their home

A song to while away the long sojourn in the hearse
Yet all of us who danse macabre to these dour, dismal tunes
Become cold, grim and hard as the dirt upon the tomb
In darkened dirges death's knell peals out it's toll
As another cadaver is consigned six feet down to its hole
But ere the last shovel of dirt falls on the wall of the box
We gravely offer a salute to those about to rot
So lift up your severed heads, in a song for the dead
Life's course ever runs red, so let no lyric remain unsaid
As from our mouths the melody is bled, in a symphony scripted in red
Like rats by the piper we're led, to join in this song for the dead

The humor of the gallons never fails to ring true
In this dead, bleak, sick world that we're hung, drawn and quartered though
As each internecine instrument plays its own bloody part
The hammering of coffin nails outpaces the beating of our hearts
Symphonic surgery orchestrated, a cleaver conducts
The execrable epiphany comes too late, just to reduce us to chunks
Rising up from the sod heaves a gross, putrid breath
As the chorus is joined in this song for the dead
So lift up your severed heads, in a song for the dead
Life's course ever runs red, so let no lyric remain unsaid
As from our mouths the melody is bled, in a symphony scripted in red

Eviscerated etudes for the de-brained, plucked upon heartstring stretched
On the rack
Medicinal movements decomposed
Regurgitating oratorios obscene
Forensic fugues and de-boned
Mutilating the melody's method and means
The crepitated coda dies in mid-refrain
As the sheet-music is obscured by a sanguine scarlet stain
Shattered stave lodged in your split-open splattered brain
The ruptured meter falters as the bow is fretted once again
Acrid arias are screeched
The bloated thorax is breached
Abrading viscera with bleach
Grotesquely gavage the deceased

Cleaving the clef
Broken notes bleed into a mess
Falling on ears so deaf
So it ever is in death
Carbonized cantatas corrupt, ringing out, sewing seeds of dischord and
Dismay
Suppurated sonatas erupt, Purulent pizzicatos slicing every which way
The truncated cadence is sundered, Bloody scraps of sheet music
Unintellibly scrawled
Threnodies resonate six feet under, To where all life's fractured melodies
Will finally resolve
The symphonic slaughter's swells without restraint
As the cacophonous cadenza splits your eardrums clean in twain
The repugnant orchestra pit an abattoir of death and pain
The hatchet falls in sharp staccato until everyone is slain",A Song for the Dead

Hanging low on leather belts

There a source for the pain in my head,

Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic

Pump it up when you don't really need it

Exodus,"Got out of bed about 3 PM thought it was a holiday
Then my boss called just to tell me
I'm late and he's giving my job away
Well I took me a walk to the liquor store
So I could drink away my blues
Spent my last ten bucks, then I dropped the bottle
And I broke it all over my shoes
So I got home to find the power's shut off,
There was someone knocking at my door
It was my landlord serving an eviction notice
'Cause my checks are bouncing off the floor
I pounded my head up against the wall
Thinking what else could go wrong
But this was only the beginning to a real bad day,
It wasn't gonna be a lot of fun

I knew I should have never gotten out of bed
'Cause of the rain cloud above my head
I'm down on my luck and it's plain to see
So tell me why does this happen to me?

When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours on me
When it rains it pours, and there's a storm moving in on me
When it rains it pours, raining down on only me
When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours

I drove across town to go see a friend
When I heard a siren on my tail
It turned out I had a warrant for my arrest
And I couldn't even post the bail
So I'm sittin' in a cell for 48 hours
Keepin' company with thieves and drunks
I'm free to go but my car's impounded
And I'm thinkin' 'bout becoming a monk
So I'm wandering around in a catatonic daze
Now barely a shell of a man
I look like I live out of a shopping cart
And I'm picking up aluminum cans
I staggered my way to an overpass
And fell to the dirt asleep
I figured out tomorrow is a new day
And maybe I could buy myself a life real cheap",When It Rains It Pours
Exodus,"Your body lies without a twitch-can't move
Feeling gone, nothing to say or do
Still alive but you can't think or see
You're looking like a vegetable to me

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind

Time rolls by and you never paid the cost
Without your mind your body-it's lost
Should we help to keep you alive?
Now's the time to help you

No dreams, no thoughts it's only
Endless time

I love the sound of pain

And slay some innocent fool

Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground

The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings pleasure that I need
The rotting hide the burning flesh
The smell and I agree
Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

Cause murder's such a dirty word

Their tubes are only fit to be tied

Stupidity should not be multiplied
Lend them not a helping hand
Or the future will be damned
The world will take a turn for the worse
The human race should be purified
Or we'll all be mongrelized
Implement the cure for the curse

Leads us to deceive the mother of mankind
Nature is our master, we serve her through our deeds
She teaches us that only death is guaranteed
If there was a hell, there must I ever be
Eternal life in heaven is but a fallacy
So if death is nothing, but a path to be trod
Walk with me and let me introduce you to your God

Come see an exhibition of atrocity
An ocean of eternity
One in which the shore you’ll never see
Or your God of make believe

You speak to the sky and no one answers back
And yet you wager the word of God is fact
The horrors we imagine in vivid clarity
Become a spectacle, your God’s atrocities
A mirror image, reflection of your soul
Just nature’s play, all her children have a role
God’s an actor, the world nature’s stage
Our fates are scripted like so many
Letters on a page

A composition of atrocity
The Story of Christianity
A fairy tale of tyranny
Recipe for catastrophe

Man’s inclination
Is to bend those who oppose to our will
Does your great creator think
The good are better made by ills?
Dream after dream, time after time
He who conquers endures
The grand design of the mother
We the disease, and her the cure

Unsatisfied longing for the slaughter
The master often slays her sons and her daughters
Death is but and undress of skin and of bone
When you return to her, no sins to atone

Let all the poisons that lurk in the mind
Hatch out

Go out for drinks, take it all back
We'll take it real slow, we'll do it with care
When you're rebuilding lives, you gotta start somewhere

Like a blackbird singing around your head tonight
When you're out late and you're walking around
Corners keeping you tight and passengers sleeping
High above your head on the aeroplane's journey
To the moon and back again

You play it so cool but something's withheld
When you're riding with me, you got nothing to tell
Can see it in your eyes, see it in your sweat
On the count of three, you can let go of it

And sometimes I sleep through it all
Sometimes I break through the wall
Then I wake up it starts again
The evil inside of my head

Like a blackbird singing around your head tonight
When you're out late and you're walking around
Corners keeping you tight and the passengers sleeping
High above your head on the aeroplane's journey
To the moon, to the moon and back again

I know that I oughta find someone new
But all I find is myself always thinking of you

[Chorus]

Oh, no matter what I do,
Each night's a lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this
I need your touch
You're the only one I've ever loved
Oh oh ah

And as long as the stars shine down from the heavens,
Long as the rivers run to the sea,
I'll never get over you getting over me

I'll never get over you getting over me",I'll Never Get Over You Getting Over Me

That never seemed to shine
And love was there for every heart
Seemed every heart but mine
That's how it seemed to be
Then darling you changed everything
Just when I thought I'd given up
Out walked loneliness

In walked love
In walked you
In walked all my dreams of coming true
In walked love
Right through my door
I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for I have found in you
I've found the one that I've been dreaming of
In walked love

I tossed my heart into the wind
I had thrown all hope away
Then love would ever let me in
And then you came my way
Just like a ray of light
That breaks the long cold night
Brought in a brand new morning sun
Out walked loneliness

In walked love
In walked you
In walked all my dreams of coming true
In walked love
Right through my door
I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for I have found in you

I'll never understand

That made me so happy
Make me so sad?
I don't understand
How could the same eyes
That used to be laughing
Cry in the night?
It doesn't seem right at all

Remembering the nights we held onto each other,
The times you told me you'd never love another
(Remember when) I was all you ever needed
Where are you when I need you now?

Sunny days
Have left me standing in the rain (standing in the rain)

Extol,"Blessed is he who has got
His transgressions forgiven
And his sins hidden
Blessed is the man whom the Lord
Do not ascribe misdeeds
And is without deceit in his spirit

Buried it deep inside
But soon a sprout came forth
It kept on growing
I couldn't hide
When I kept it to myself
Slowly my bones corroded
And my vitality vanished
Like in the summer dry

Too many people living this life
Who can take their guilt away?
Their minds are rotting
And causing an endless pain
Soon they are demented and put away

I confessed my sins to You
And did not hide my guilt
I said ""I want to confess my misdeeds to You""
And He took away my sin and guilt

He is my sanctuary

Extol,"I close my eyes
It's not the picture of You I see
The impressions, the sight, the thoughts
Are stuck into my mind

My vision is blurred
I can't see clearly
I can't hear Your voice
It's all disturbing my peace of mind

Something inside tearing me apart
Trusting myself to find the way out
Leading me just deeper into
A well of confusion and mourning

There is nothing else for me to do
But to put my hope and trust in You
I know You will lead me through
When my eyes are focused on You

Let me live in Your shadow
Free me from these destroying plagues
Your faithfulness is my shield and protection",Shelter

Still it's hard to forget,

What it leaves behind
A lot of love lost,
Your feelings are wasted,
Tasted the sweetness,

But now you're faced with,
The thought, of being alone
Nor more companionship,
You can handle it,

Just abandon it,
Leave it behind,
And look for the brighter day
Give it some time,

'Cause it won't come right away
You gotta be standing strong,
Hold on to your dignity
Don't sit around,

Saying look what ya did to me
It's time to move on,
You gotta continue
To look for a love,

Of a life that's within you
Cupid is dead now,
It's time to rely on,
Yourself to cope

You got no shoulder to cry on

Tumbado todo el día en tu sofá,
Para un poco quieto why ponte a la sombra Tomás.

Extremoduro,"A fuego lento no se calientan mis huesos why bajé al infierno a ver cómo se cuecen tus besos
cansado de buscar un trocito de cielo
lleno de pelos.

why a deshora sale un sol alumbrando una esquina why alegrándome el día

¿Dónde están los besos que te debo?
En una cajita;
que nunca llevo el corazón encima
por si me lo quitan.

Me salgo de mi casa,
me estrello contra la acera;
no puedo recordar qué clase de mundo hay fuera:
salté por la ventana buscando una liana
-¡Árbol va!- why Tarzán al suelo.

why harto de buscarte siempre a oscuras
why de volverme en puro hielo
tiré toda mi vida a la basura,
why ni las ratas se la comieron.
Nadie me persigue pero yo acelero.
Llaman a mi puerta why yo ya a nadie espero.

Pero ¿dónde están los besos que te debo?
En una cajita;
que nunca llevo el corazón encima
por si me lo quitan.
Pero ¿dónde están los besos que me debes?
En cualquier esquina,
cansados de vivir en tu boquita
siempre a la deriva

why llega en tu braguita el amor de visita why en mis pantalones entre los cojones.
Voy a tatuarme ,azul, una casita
para que allí vivan nuestros corazones.

why a deshora sale un sol alumbrando una esquina why alegrándome el día.
¿Dónde están los besos que te debo?
En una cajita;
que nunca llevo el corazón encima
por si me lo quitan.
Pero ¿Dónde están los besos que me debes?
En cualquier esquina,
cansados de vivir en tu boquita
siempre a la deriva

Cuando ya no puedo más saco para respirar
un ratito el corazón, que lo tengo en carne viva;
sólo un poco de calor hare que me vuelva a la vida
why lo pongo a secar al sol escondido en un renglón.

why a deshora sale el sol alumbrando una esquina why alegrándome el día.

Extremoduro,"Pepe Botika es un honrado traficante tomando copas me l'encuentro to los días 
me cuenta historias de sus años en la cárcel 
a veces había suerte why si tenía pasta salía. 
Que vergüenza, Señoría. ¿Cuánto cuesta su amnistía? 
Lo colocaron con las manos en la masa 
cuando venía del campo de coger higos
entodavía no l'an visto por su casa
lo tienen preventivo en una celda de castigo
¿¡Dónde están mis amigos!? Encerrados sin motivo. 
Carabanchel, La Modelo. Herrera de la Mancha,
Cáceres II. Alcalá Meco, Puerto de Santa María. 
El contrabando era su oficio más brillante 
why las fronteras se las salta to los días 
tengo colegas en casi todas las cárceles 
era de Plasencia me parece que decía. 
Que vergüenza, Señoría ¿Cuánto cuesta su amnistía? 
Un día le hicieron un registro al soterrizo 
why le incautaron 20 kilos de chorizo 
hashis, caballo why cocaína pal que compre 
pues ya lo dijo dios: no sólo de pan vive el hombre.",Pepe Botika (¿Dónde Están Mis Amigos?)
Extremoduro,"Puede que me deje llevar puede que levante la voz 
why puede que me arranque sin más,
¡a ver qué me dice después! 
Quiero ser tu perro fiel, 
tu esclavo sin rechistar 
que luego me desato why verás, 
¡a ver qué me dices después! 
So payaso, me tiemblan los pies a su lado 
me dice que estoy descolorío, 
la empiezo a besar... 
¡a ver qué me dice después! 
So cretino, me tiemblan los pies a su lado 
me dice que estoy desconocío,
me empiezo a pensar...
¡a ver qué me dice después! 
Acércate why verás 
que no sé como hacerlo peor,
despacito pero mu mal, 
¡a ver qué me dice después! 
Hago casas de cartón, 
ayer bebí hasta jurar 
pero hoy no me levanta ni dios, 
¡a ver qué me dice después! 
So payaso...",So Payaso
