Randy Travis,"Meet me under the mistletoe
Midnight Christmas Eve
Your sweet kiss is the first gift
I'd like to receive
The presents that we bought
Will have to wait beneath the tree
Meet me under the mistletoe
Midnight Christmas Eve

There's frost on all the windows
Candles burning bright
Stockings on the mantle
Everything's just right
Soon the house will come alive
With family and friends
I'd love some time alone with you
Before it all begins

Meet me under the mistletoe
Midnight Christmas Eve
Your sweet kiss is the first gift
I'd like to receive
The presents that we bought
Will have to wait beneath the tree
Meet me under the mistletoe
Midnight Christmas Eve

It seems I've hardly seen you
We've had so much to do
With the holiday approaching
I've sure been missing you
I can't wait till Christmas morn
To hold you in my arms
I'm feeling like a kid again
Waiting on Santa Clause!

Meet me under the mistletoe
Midnight Christmas Eve
Your sweet kiss is the first gift
I'd like to receive
The presents that we bought
Will have to wait beneath the tree
Meet me under the mistletoe
Midnight Christmas Eve",Meet Me Under the Mistletoe
Randy Travis,"The night before Christmas alone in the dark
Not a creature is stirring except for my heart
This old house without you just don't feel right
Oh, what a silent night

Then in the twinklin' of my eye
A teardrop comes fallin' as I realize
I'm all alone and you're by his side
Oh, what a silent night

Your stockin' are hangin' across our old bed
As visions of yesterdays dance in my head
The fire burns hotter but I'm cold as ice
Oh, what a silent night

Then in the twinklin' of my eye
A teardrop comes fallin' as I realize
I'm all alone and you're by his side
Oh, what a silent night
Oh, what a silent night

","Oh, What a Silent Night"
Randy Travis,"The ol log is burnin'
Yellow and red
Small eyes are fightin'
That ol' sleepy head
Stockin's are filled
While stories of goodwill are told
At the edge of the bed.
It's an old time Christmas
Family and friends 'round the tree 
It's an old time Christmas
Like the ones in my memory.
Now the gifts are all open
The kids in the yard
Granddad nods off in a chair
And the smells from the kitchen
Are to fine to mention
And there's peace
On Earth everywhere.
It's an old time Christmas
Family and friends 'round the tree 
It's an old time Christmas
Like the ones in my memory.
Church bells ringin'
Choirs singin' everywhere
There's love in the air
It's an old time Christmas
Family and friends 'roubd the tree
It's an old time Christmas
Like the ones in my memory.
It's an old time Christmas
Like the ones in my memory...",Old Time Christmas
Randy Travis,"Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write ?I love you?
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

Crowded street, busy feet hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by

Should you stop?, better not, much too busy
You're in a hurry, my how time does fly
In the distance the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of the laughter he cries

Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write ?I love you?
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

",Pretty Paper
Randy Travis,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Randy Travis,"I sent out... Seasons greetings
To all our same old friends
The tree is trimmed and in your favorite place
I decked the halls with holly
Built a snowman in the lane
I sang jingle bells and a one horse open sleigh

But
White Christmas makes me blue
Every time I hear it play I think of you
I remember all the good ones we knew
Oh... White Christmas makes me blue

I'm trying to be happy
I know you'd want me to
Being sad at Christmas time ain't right
I'm keeping our traditions ""wishing you were here""
On Christmas eve I still sing silent night

But White Christmas makes me blue
Every time I hear it play I think of you
I remember all the good ones we knew
Oh... White Christmas makes me blue
Oh... White Christmas makes me blue...",White Christmas Makes Me Blue
Randy Travis,"Not too many years ago
When dreams were coming true
I'd reach for inspiration
Sometimes it would be you

I'd hear you on the radio
I sure did like your sound
Say it's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around

From the smoke it's hard to tell
What's coming down the line
We heard you were a fast train
Coming out of Caroline

We wondered what you were haulin'
When you rolled into town
Say it's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around

You must have felt that same old feeling
More than once or twice
Guitars pressed against our hearts
Under the neon lights

I've got to say that feeling
Is the best that I have found
Lord it's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around

There's a lot of truth you know
In our kind of songs
About the life you're living
And how love's done you wrong

As long as there's a jukebox
And a honky tonk in town
It's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around

It's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around",A Few Ole Country Boys (With George Jones)
Randy Travis,"First we were strangers both down on our luck
And both in need of a friend
We promised each other 
To much to live up to
And now we're strangers again

I came like a stranger
And you took me in
And I felt at home in your arms
We had nothing but good times 
As long as the sun shines
But we just couldn't weather the storms

You came like a stranger 
And I took you in
And you gave me some reasons
To live
I gave the good the good times 
And you gave the sunshine
Till we ran out of good things to give

Now we are strangers back down on our luck
And both in need of a friend
We promised each other
To much to live up to
And now we're strangers again

Strangers again",We're Strangers Again (With Tammy Wynette)
Randy Travis,"Oh they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon as only they can

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that as part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues",Birth of the Blues
Randy Travis,"Somebody listen, I'm a voice in the distance cryin'
Come see about me
I am a stranger in a world filled with anger
Come see about me
I'm gettin' weary tryin' to carry this load all by myself
I'm bone tired and fallin', can't you hear me callin'
I need somebody's help

I am a young man growin' wild across this land
Come see about me
I'm fourscore and twenty and I ain't got anybody
Come see about me
I'm somebody's children alone and forsaken, a wave
That's lost at sea
I'm right here behind you, I'm all around you, 
So slow down
Turn around and you will see

I'm your mother, your sister and your brother
Come see about me
I am a baby, my mother ain't no lady
Come see about me
I am your maker, the giver and the taker
Come see about me",Come See About Me

Randy Travis,"Some trails are happy ones
Others are blue

It's the way you ride the trail that counts
Here's a happy one for you

Happy trails to you
Until we meet again
Happy trails to you
Keep smiling until then

Who cares about the clouds when we're together?
Just sing a song, and bring the sunny weather

Happy trails to you
Until we meet again",Happy Trails
Randy Travis,"We've flown to the moon, but have we missed the boat along the way?
We reached for the stars, but are we that far removed from the cave?
We've got radios and coded phones, computers
We found satellites in space
Now everybody's talking
So tell me why we can't communicate

[Chorus:]
Are we losing the human race?
Do we ever really learn from our mistakes?
Who's ahead, who's behind?
Will there be a finish line?
Are we losing the human race?

Nations are starving while we pay our farmers not to grow their grain
Fossil fuel is going up in smoke and coming down in acid rain
The more that we progress it seems
The farther we keep slipping down that drain
It's a no-win situation
So tell me why we have to play the game

[Chorus]

Who's ahead, who's behind?
Will there be a finish line?
Are we losing the human race?",The Human Race
Randy Travis,"Down through the ages men have died for women
And done so for many times
Each time I loved one, I've always lost one
Seems the right one is so hard to find

[Chorus:]
Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them
One in each color, one in each style
I'll find a lady someday to wear them
My shopping will be done for awhile

I'll bet somewhere's a lady shopping for britches
Comparing the value, appraising each pair
Maybe someday the Lord will bring us together
And we ll both have a new wardrobe to wear

Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them
One in each color and one in each style
Maybe someday if I'm lucky
I'll find someone to wear them
And my shopping will be done for awhile
My shopping will be done for awhile

I'm looking for a lady who'll look good in dresses
She must be red-headed, green eyes and be fair
I'll make exceptions to all my requirements
As long as she s willing to care

[Chorus:]

I just saw a beauty with blue eyes, what a cutie
Bond hair like a halo around her did flow
But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely
In the dresses I bought long ago

[Chorus:]

Now as I sit here dreaming, planning and scheming
Why should I make standards when everyone knows
As your need ranges, women make changes
And you must accept them or just let them go

[Chorus:]",Shopping for Dresses
Randy Travis,"I was ten years old on my grandpa's farm when it happened
After all these years i can still hear grandpa laughin'
As he applied that barnyard remedy
He passed his wisdom down to me
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

I remember my first crush was on the preacher's daughter
We were smoochin' on the front porch swing that night when he caught her
We weren't expectin' him home until quarter past ten
When the good Lord taught me that lesson again
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

[Chorus]
You don't point your pistol before you check each chamber
And you don't drink no you don't drink when you drive
It's just ordinary common sense to avoid that danger
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

She rolled into town with rodeo,she was a beauty
And that cowboy saw you wink at her,she was a cutie
The sound of jinglin' spurs caught me dead on a run
He was fit to be tied and you were under the gun
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

[Chorus]
You don't point your pistol before you check each chamber
And you don't drink no you don't drink when you drive
It's just ordinary common sense to avoid that danger
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

No,you don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive
You're gonna get stung boy",Smokin' the Hive
Randy Travis,"This old road has taken its toll
I've been broke down but now I'm back on a roll
Got it in gear, sittin' on go
Just waiting on the light to change

I'm going places straight to the top
I'm all revved up, my engine's hot
Just temporarily come to a stop
And I'm waiting on the light to change

I took a little detour, wrong way down a one way street
I had to learn the hard way, no short cut to easy street

I lose my way now and then
But better days are just around the bend
I'm gonna get myself movin' again
I'm just waiting on the light to change

I took a little detour, wrong way down a one way street
I had to learn the hard way, no short cuts to easy street

Both my hands are on the wheel
My turn will come I know it will
From now on it's all down hill
I'm just waiting on the light to change",Waiting on the Light to Change
Randy Travis,"There's do'ers and don'ters and I wills and won'ters
And them, that don't even try
Givers and takers, movers and shakers
And them that are just passing by

Skidrows and winos and some folks that I know
That don't do like I think they should
I thought they were livin' their lifes all wrong
Long, before I understood

We all have to walk our own road
We can't always go where we're told
In the end where it'll end up, the Lord only knows
But we all have to walk our own road

I've had some good times and I've had a good life
And I've had things goin' my way
I've walked the highground and treasures that I've found
An' women who brightened my day

Then there were times I was caught in the crosswinds
With life, goin' 'round and around
Like a ship with no sail I was caught in a gale
'Til I fin'ly just ran it a-ground

We all have to walk our own road
We can't always go where we're told
In the end where it'll end up, the Lord only knows
But we all have to walk our own road.",Walk Our Own Road
Randy Travis,"Yes I hid your car keys, honey
Yes I hid your suitcase
And I'm the reason you can't find 
Your makeup and your toothpaste
And I'll do anything it takes 
To keep you here with me
Losing you's a sure way 
To set off my allergies

[Chorus:]
I'm allergic to the blues
I get these teardrops in my eyes
You know I've always had a bad reaction to goodbyes
So 'till they find some injection
To calm that love rejection
All I've got to save me now is you
I'm allergic to the blues

It won't be five minutes
After you walk out that front door
'Till I'll be fightin' for my breath and
Feelin' like I'm done for
Well they might find me froze to death
In our bed alone
Now do you really want that 
On your conscience while your gone

[Chorus:]",Allergic to the Blues
Randy Travis,"I found myself
In a cross condition
Maybe it was her
Maybe it was me
Somethin's wrong
There was somethin' missin'
I couldn't stand to stay
So I had to leave

A half a tank of gas
Brought me this distance
Half a mind to run
Got me this far
There's a woman willin'
Where there ain't no witness
'Cept the one that lives
In my heart of hearts

My heart of hearts
Won't lie to me
It won't tell me things
That I can't believe
I better stop this thing
Before it starts
'Cause it don't feel right
To my heart of hearts

I could be tastin'
Stolen kisses
But that might
Tear my world apart
When it all comes down
To my wish of wishes
I'd have to go with
My heart of hearts

My heart of hearts
Won't lie to me
It won't tell me things
That I can't believe
I better stop this thing
Before it starts
'Cause it don't feel right

Won't lie to me",Heart of Hearts
Randy Travis,"High in a tree on the top of the hill
By the light of the lonesome ol? moon
I hear the call of a lone whippoorwill
Singing his mournful tune

Way off in the night blows the long freight train
With a roar and a ramble of wheels
My poor heart is breaking with every refrain
'Cause it sounds just like the way I feel

And it's high lonesome
High lonesome heartbroken and blue
High lonesome
Lil? darling I'm lonesome for you

Do you ever get weary roamin' around?
Do you think of the sweet love we knew?
Do you ever get lonesome the way I am now?
Lil? darling I'm lonesome for you

And it's high lonesome
High lonesome heartbroken and blue
It?s a high lonesome
Lil? darling I'm lonesome for you

It's high lonesome
Lil? darling I'm lonesome for you
",High Lonesome
Randy Travis,"I wake up to the silence
In a room where I once heard ""Good Morning Dear""
I never thought I'd miss the early morning smell
Of hairspray in the air
All the little things I used to take for granted
Now I miss them most of all
Ain't it funny how a woman walking out the door
Can bring a man to crawl
And I'd surrender all
To bring you back to me
Give up everything I own
Get down on my hands and knees
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall
Oh, If you would only call, I'd surrender all
Now I'm staring out the window
Praying every passing car would bring you home
So I could take you in my arms 
And give the kind of love
You should have known
And I'd surrender all
To bring you back to me
Give up everything I own
Get down on my hands and knees
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall
Oh, If you would only call, I'd surrender all
If you would only call, I'd surrender all",I'd Surrender All
Randy Travis,"I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus
When I get home tonight

And I know he'll make them right
Then I'll ask him to forgive me
For the things that I've done wrong
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus
Tonight when I get home

Just livin' day to day

Randy Travis,"You say love is just a lie
And it always ends with a sad goodbye
It makes you hurt 
It makes you cry
But I say wait 
Let me try
Let me lay my hands on upon your heart
And see if they can heal
Those secrets scars of loneliness
That you cannot conceal
I will wipe away the saddest tear
That falls from your blue eyes
My love can heal the hurt you feel 
Let me try
You say you know how it would end
That you'll wake up alone again
But love that's true wonst say goodbye
And if you'll only

Randy Travis,"There is a point when you can not walk away,
When you have to stand up straight and tall,
And mean the words you say.
There is a point you must beside,
Just to do it because it's right,
That's when you become a point of light.

There is a darkness that everyone must face,
It wants to take what's good and fair,
And lay it on the waste.
And that darkness,
covers everything inside,
Until it meat a single point of light.

Home it takes 
it's a point of light
a ray of hope 
in the darkest night
if you see what's wrong 
and you try to make it right
You will see a point of light

There are heroes,
Whose name we never heard,
a dedicated army of quiet volunteers.
Reaching out to feed the hungry,
reaching out to save the land,
reaching out to help they'r fellow  man.

There are dreamers
who are make this dream come true
taking time to teach the children, 
there is nothing they can't do.
Giving shelter to the homeless,
giving hope to those without,
is'nt that what this land all about.

One by one, from the mountain to the see,
point's of light, are calling out for you and me.

Home it takes 
it's a point of light
a ray of hope 
in the darkest night
if you see what's wrong 
and you try to make it right
You will see a point of light

If you see what's wrong
and you try to make it right
You will be
a point of light.

Randy Travis,"Operator, please connect me with 1982
I need to make apologies for what I didn't do
I sure do need to tell her that I've thought the whole thing through
And now its clear that she is what I should have held on to

[Chorus]
They say hindsight's twenty-twenty
But I'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
Its that same ole lost love story
Its sad but its true
There was a time when she was mine in 1982

Postman can you sell me a special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man
Back into the wasted years of my living past
I need to tell her now I know how long my love will last

[Chorus]

Losin' my mind, goin' back in time to 1982",1982
Randy Travis,"Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love
Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall
But that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I have to sing this song about all the things I knew

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill

From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same
So this is just another way of sayin' the same thing

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill",Deeper Than the Holler
Randy Travis,"Since the day I was led to temptation
And in weakness did let your love down
I have prayed that with time and compassion
You'd come around

I keep waiting for you to forgive me
And you keep saying you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

Now this home we have built is still standing
Its foundation is on solid ground
Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
Or burn it down

[Chorus]

We can't just block it out we've got to talk it out
Until our hearts get back in touch
I need your love I miss it I can't go on like this is
Hurts too much",Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart
Randy Travis,"I ain't live forever but I've lived enough
And I've learned to be gentle and I've learned to be tough
I've found only two things that last to the end
One is your heroes and the other your friends

Your heroes will help you find good in yourself
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends

I grew up with cowboys I watched on tv
My friends and I sometimes pretended to be
Years have gone by but now and again
My heart rides the range with my heroes and friends

Your heroes will help you find good in yourself
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin

Randy Travis,"Dirt road in the twilight, woods so cool and dark.
Up ahead pale neon, somewhere a dog barks,
Honky tonk moon, keeps shining on my baby and me

Breaking up the pool balls, chalking up the cues
Jukebox pumping softly, lazy summer blues
Honky tonk moon, keeps shining on my baby and me

Through the blue smoky haze, all through the haze 
Trouble seems to melt away,
My heart's on a roll, I'm easy in my soul
There's no hurry, no worry, things are goin' my way

My arms around my baby, shufflin' on the floor
Cigarettes and saw-dust, squeaky old screen door.
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.

Outside the dark is falling, stars are twinkling bright
That old hoot owl is calling, every-things all right

Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.",Honky Tonk Moon
Randy Travis,"Suppose I called you up tonight
And told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson

And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell my that you love me too

And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say


I told you so, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees
And told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old-time feeling

Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely

And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned

And would you say

I told you so, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again",I Told You So
Randy Travis,"Well I lost my heart on the day we met
But I gained a lot, and that I don't regret.
Then I hung around 'till you said ""I do""
I knew I wouldn't have nothing

If I didn't have you.
Well it changed my thinking
And it changed your name.
And neither one of us will ever be the same.

And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue,
'Cause I wouldn't have nothing
If I didn't have you.

If I didn't have you
I'd long ago
Been left in the dark, out in the cold.
Blowing around from town to town

Like a feather in the wind.
If I didn't have you
I know I'd be
Floundering around like a ship at sea.

Lost in the rain of a hurricane,
And that's where I'd have been.

But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No I wouldn't have nothing

If I didn't have you
Well I count my blessings every night I pray
That the lord lets me keep you just one more day
And every day he does cause God knows too

That I wouldn't have nothing
If I didn't have you

If I didn't have you

Been left in the dark, out in the cold.

And hold you close to me, all night long.
So many lover's games I could play with you
And on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong

But on the other hand, There's a golden band
To remind of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes I found myself
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else

To remind of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man

To lay sound asleep by my side
The bills they are mounting that's when I start counting 
On someone to help sooth my pride

The dreams that I've buried the load that I've carried

Randy Travis,"He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck,
And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck,
I thought that he walked on water

He said he was a cowboy when he was young
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,
And I thought that he walked on water

If the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo
And although his wings, they were never seen
I thought that he walked on water

Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,
And said, ""son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot""
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot
Then I'd flop down beside him

And he was ninety years old in sixty-three
And I loved him and he loved me
And lord, I cried the day he died,

'Cause I thought that he walked on water

I'll tell you all my troubles on the ol' Chisholm Trail
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea, youpy yea

I started up the trail October twenty-third
Started up the trail with the U-2 herd
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea, youpy yea
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea.

On a ten dollar horse and a forty dollar saddle
Started out punchin' them long horn cattle

With my seat in the saddle and my hand on the horn
I'm the best dang cowboy that was ever born
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea, youpy yea
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea.

It's cloudy in the west and lookin' like rain
And my danged old slicker's in the wagon again
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea, youpy yea
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea.

The wind began to blow and the rain began to fall
And it looked like we were gonna lose 'em all
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea, youpy yea
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea.

No chaps, no slickers and it's pouring rain
I swear I'll never night herd again

Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea, youpy yea

Well, I went to the boss to draw my roll
And the boss had me fugured nine dollars in the hole
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea, youpy yea
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea.

Well, me and the boss we had a little spat
So I hit him in the face with my ten gallon hat
Come a-ti yi youpy, youpy yea, youpy yea

Not only you but the whole darn crew.''

Randy Travis,"On the top shelf in the closet,
In the workshop where he spent his extra time
Was a dust wooden box that I had never noticed till that time
And we set on the table and carefully, we opened up the top
And stared into the memory
Daddy kept inside the box
 
There was a letter from mamma, when she went out to Reno
To help her sister out in 62
And a flower from Hawaii, when they went on vacation
It was the first time that my Daddy ever flew
 
And the pocket knife I gave to him on Fathers day
Years ago, I thought it had been lost
We all thought his heart was made from solid rock
But that was long before we found the box
 
I guess we always knew it_but ""I love you"" was hard for him to say
Some men show it easy and some just never seem to find the way
But that night I began to see the softer side of some I had lost
I saw the love he kept inside the first time we opened up the box
 
There was a picture that was taken,when he and Mom were dating
Standing by his 1040 Ford and the faded leather Bible, he got when he was baptized
I guess no one understood him like the Lord
 
And the poem that he had written, about his wife and children
The tender words he spoke were quite a shock

Shoutin' out some prophecy to everyone he'd meet
He was a local fixture like a cop out on a beat
Folks said he'd been shell-shocked long ago
And more than that, no one seemed to know

Oscar was a walker, at least four miles twice a day
The entire length of main street he'd be shoutin' all the way
And I had no idea where he'd heard the things, he'd say
But he was not your normal voice of doom
It was a happy song, sung slightly out of tune

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven
And we will all be angels some day
What you are in this world don't count for nothin'
'Cause we are only children, we're just lost along the way
But we will all be angels some day""

Well I worked at the Rial to, I sold tickets at the door
And Oscar he'd come by most ev'ryday 'bout half past four
And he'd pay to see some movie that he'd seen ten times before
But mostly we'd just let him in for free
And he'd watch five minutes, then he'd come and talk to me

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven
And we will all be angels some day
What you are in this world don't count for nothin'
'Cause we are only children, we're just lost along the way
But we will all be angels some day""

Well it's going on ten years now since I left my home town
And I went home last summer; for a week I hung around
I looked out for Oscar, he was nowhere to be found
Someone said they finally had to commit him
And he died, before they had time to forget him

Now I'm not about to argue, Oscar's train had jumped the tracks
But I'll bet my last dollar on a plain and simple fact
Oscar never said a word about me behind my back
And the way that I was raised to understand
Well, that bone, makes him the better man

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven
And we will all be angels some day
What you are in this world don't count for nothin'
'Cause we are only children, we're just lost along the way
But we will all be angels some day""

Ya, we will all be angels someday

As far as your memory goes
That's where I draw the line

I'll bet this isn't how you planned it
I've picked myself up off the ground
These legs are shakin' but they?e standin' 
And I won? let you knock me down

Randy Travis,"Lately I get the feeling there's something you're holding in
How can you be so quiet as close as we've been
Do you think your silence is saying there ain't nothing wrong with you
This is me you're not talking to

This is me
The one who knows you inside out
The one you've leaned on 'til now
Don't you know I'm still here for you
So what do you think you're doing
Who do you think you're fooling
This is me you're not talking to

You can run to me no matter what you're running from
If it's something I'm doing
I'll get it undone
Just don't let me be a stranger to what you're going through
This is me you're not talking to

This is me

The one you've leaned on 'til now
Don't you know I'm still here for you

Randy Travis,"I heard a freight train out across the way
I heard a woman sing Amazing Grace
I heard a night bird call to its mate
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard freedom break its chain
I heard a heart beat where once on sound remained
I heard angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name

I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name

Beating softly against the waves
Fell a sound of an early morning rain
And though the lighting and thunder came
I still heard you whisper my name

I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name

Or tired to count the stars up in the sky
I never knew the world held so much beauty

Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings.
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home.

Whose whole world he has to rearrange

To ease this pain and take my pride

Laid open wide

Said I'm gonna tunnel me a line

Down to dark to see the gold
Now he won't let go of the shovel

he's goin' down
Drivin' his future right into the ground

I tried to send him down a rope

But every day I pray and i hope
Somehow he finally gets the message
Every spade of dirt he throws
Only gets him closer to the devil
And he can't dig out of the hole

Maybe this could shine a little light
there's no healthy way to mess with

Its too late to start livin'

Than he had left to go
Closing in upon that last one 
We all must walk alone

Of the good and bad in all
Of the power and the glory 
And the lonely days that crawled

And a satisfied mind.""

He said, ""I ain't afraid of dying

Than to live this life forever.

And to lay down someday and go home

He said, ""Don't look into the darkness.
If you want to see true black,
Look into a morning's brightness
When love ain't coming back,
And you will find right there a darkness that blinds.
And don't think wealth is ever having
All you want all to yourself;
It is found when you are giving
What you have to someone else
The only difference in the rich and the poor
Is a satisfied mind.""

Until I caught a glimpse of my reflection
I looked up into my own eyes
And saw someone startin' back I didn't recognize.

There's a stranger in my mirror
Who don't know how to behave
He keeps grinnin' bout you and whistlin' tunes
While he ought to be watchin' me shave
We move alike and we look the same,
But I swear we've got totally different brains,
And the love we're in with you,
Just makes it clearer,
He used to be my twin,
Now there's a stranger in my mirror

The only reason for hangin' on
Is you and you alone

When to harvest
How you weed just what you sow
When to look for rain and who to turn to when it don't

Handed down the day she died

Knew Paul and peter by first name

From the wear and tear of times

Were pieces of her broken heart
I gathered her up, the pieces I found
I put her back together like a busted guitar
But some glue holds and some glue don't In spite of everything I tried
Somebody's stole my darlin'
Right before my very eyes

He didn't walk, talk or push his way in
Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind
He didn't sprout wings
And he sure wasn't playin' no harp
As low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
He must've crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart

Copin' with hone and hoping i'm wrong
But I sure see a definite change
There's look in her eyes that's sayin' goodbye
And her snuggle when I hold her don't feel the same
The way her heart bests for that sneaky thief
You would picture him dark and tall
But the feller that stole my darlin'
Lord, he'd have to be very small

By heavenly design

And goes wild at times
When cupid aims his arrow

It means like a drum in a marching band
Can't help what it does I just follow where it leads
How my heart feels about you baby makes perfect sense to me

That you could stand on 
Stronger than an old oak tree 
But all you ever wanted was the one thing 
That I never let you see -

No room for weakness 
I covered every crack in the wall 
But there ain't no way that I can 
Keep this secret

Like Cheriko I fall

Would I even care?

And he ain't on lie with the internet
He says guitar music entertains us here
and it sounds real good to the untrained ear

Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key

I spend my nights alone
Where love was once so full and free

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

Bright shining as the sun.

There was something special in the man
There was much more to his life

That would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind
If you only took the time""

Treat your brother like a friend
Always turn the other cheek
Help the weary and the weak

And as your life unfolds
Each kindness that you've shown
Will be the nails and hammers 
As you build your final ladder 
In the manner of the carpenter of old 

You could feel compassion in his eyes
Only fools that hurt him did not realize
That he was speaking to us all
The righteous and the mighty
The silent and the small

Was a little good old rock and roll,

And my name on the roll,

Spread like that before,

Can open heaven's door,

They say, ""It's a crime to even pray within the halls""

Once you live inside a heart, they can't take You out

We've been found to reach the lost
In city streets, down country roads
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go

Here's to those across the land, working in a place
Where the boss man and the government say they can't share their faith
But they know all too well they'll lose their job if they get caught
But to win a soul for Jesus, they will risk it all because

We are soldiers of the Cross
We've been found to reach the lost
In city streets, down country roads
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go

In the God of all creation, we put our faith and trust
And give our lives to You 'cause You gave Your life for us

In city streets, down country roads
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go

They wrapped him up with gentle hands. 
God hoped the world would understand. 
Eternal life we shall receive. 
And all that He asks in return is that we just believe.

He was the Son God sent to one and all. 
Put on this earth to hang there on that cross. 
Born to die so we could live. 
He had the birthday, we got the gift.
There's no way in this world we could repay 
The miracle He gave us on that day.

Randy Travis,"All our days are numbered
Some live on borrowed time
But life is what you make it
Thank God I was so inclined
To accept my Lord and Savior
When the good news sunk in
He paid a heavenly price
By giving His life
And I can't wait to go home to Him
I'm ready to go that distance
And God only knows when that might be
But oh, what joy waits up yonder
Once this old world sets me free
When there's no tomorrow
And glory has come down
Those without Jesus
Are lost and never to be found
So please listen when I'm talking
I'm just saying what needs to be said
Make plans while your still living
It's too late when your dead
I'm ready to go that distance
And God only knows when that might be
But oh, what joy waits up yonder
Once this old world sets me free
Oh, once this old world sets me free",I'm Ready
Randy Travis,"Can you hear Jerusalem's cry
Can you see the storm on the rise
Look around you can;t deny
This is the hour of heaven's time
Armies gather in the East
For the war that's soon to come
Death will march with the mark of the beast
So seek the Light and walk with the Son

Soon we'll see His wrath come down
And the Lord descending from the sky
When you hear the trumpets sound
God has answered Jerusalem's cry

When the sun goes black
And the moon blood red
And the stars fall from the sky
The Word of God in the Bible says
We're living in the end times

Soon we'll see His wrath come down
And the Lord descending from the sky
When you hear the trumpets sound
God has answered Jerusalem's cry

Soon the dead in Christ will rise
And join Him in he sky
Even unbelivers will see
God has answered Jerusalem's cry
God has answered Jerusalem's cry

Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore

There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world

Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide

Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life


The lord said, ""Simon, haul your nets in

From now on you're a fisher of men""

Well, I like fishin',

That's why it caught my ear

The Lord knew how to get to me

And what I'd need to hear


Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore

There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world

Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide

Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life


When the sea is troubled and it's hard to stay afloat

And you feel like Jesus is sleeping in the boat

Don't you dare give up on the Prince of Peace

And in the middle of the storm

You will find a sweet release


Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore

There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world

Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide

Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life


Yeah keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life

Randy Travis,"When I first met his momma
She was just nineteen
Couldn't say for certain who the father was
I have known him since he was a pup
And I'm gonna raise him up
If you never knew your daddy
Like I never knew mine
It feels like everybody knows you're fatherless
This boy may not be blood of my blood
But I'm gonna raise him up
I'll provide for him
Walk beside of him
I am strong enough
Cause it's time he knew
What a son can do
With a father's love
He can change the world
Ya'll may have to look at Joseph
A couple thousand years ago
When he held a newborn baby he named Jesus
He said he may not be blood of my blood 
Still I'm gonna raise him up
I'll provide for him
Walk beside of him
I am strong enough
I will show him too
What a son can do
With a fathers love
And he will change the world
Thirty three years later
When the son was in his grave
Broken and abandoned by a world he came to save
His real dad said he's mine
Blood of my blood
And I'm gonna raise him up
I'll provide for you
Walk beside of you
I am strong enough
I have seen from you
What a son can do
With a fathers love

And he can change your world
But you gotta raise him up
Raise him up",Raise Him Up
Randy Travis,"A baby in a manger
The town of Bethlehem
The wise men had the heart
To know He was the great I Am

They crossed the desert many miles
To kneel down at His feet
The star that led them seemed
To tell them what had come to be

The Son's gonna rise and shine
Make the lame walk, the deaf talk
And give sight back to the blind

Bring a light into the darkness
No one can deny
As sure as there's a Heaven
The Son's gonna rise and shine

At the age of thirty-three
The prophecy fulfilled
On the cross at Calvary
His blood for man was spilled

The sky was black as midnight
But 'neath the dark and gloom
Voices rang and Angels sang
Dancing 'round the tomb

The Sons's gonna rise and shine
He'll take away the keys of death
The grave will loose its bind

Hell will be defeated
In three days of time
On resurrection morning
The Son's gonna rise and shine

It's been two thousand years
But the story's still the same
For those who will believe in Him
And call upon His name

The Son's gonna rise and shine
Heal the sick, raise the dead
The Savior of mankind

The day will soon be dawning
Will be the end of time
King of kings, Lord of Lords
The Son's gonna rise and shine

Will save your soul and mine?

The Son's gonna rise and shine?

Randy Travis,"A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher,
Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One's headed for vacation, one for higher education,
An' two of them were searchin' for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway,
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you,
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres,
The faith an' love for growin' things in his young son's heart
An' that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children:
Did her best to give 'em all a better start
An' that preacher whispered, ""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained bible in that hooker's hand

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway,
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you,
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained bible up,
For all of us to see
He said ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama,
Who read it to me""

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway,
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you,
It's what you leave behind you when you go

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway",Three Wooden Crosses

I'm believin' there's a reason for this trial
This too shall pass in a little while
Oh lord have mercy if I complain

Randy Travis,"Daddy never went to church on Sunday
He said that's one thing I'll never do
But mama never gave up she said one day
He'll be sitting here beside of me and you
I can still hear mama softly talking
With her tears falling on her folded hands
So that Easter Sunday Daddy walked in
That's when I began to understand

When mama prayed, good things happen
When mama prayed, lives were changed
Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small crumbled all away
When mama prayed

Seventeen and wild I hit the bottle
Doing anything I dang well please
Burning down life's highway at full throttle
While mama burned a candle on her knees
Then one night I came home half sober
I saw mama kneeling in the den
As I listened she and Jesus talked it over
And I knew my restless days were 'bout to end

When mama prayed, good things happen
When mama prayed, lives were changed
Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small crumbled all away
When mama prayed

It isn't like every one of them got answered
But the times they weren't it seems to me were rare
You almost felt sorry for the devil
'Cause heaven knows he didn't have a prayer
When mama prayed

Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small crumbled all away
When mama prayed
They crumbled all away
When mama prayed




",When Mama Prayed

And in weakness did let your love down
I have prayed that with time and compassion
You'd come around

Chorus:

I keep waiting for you to forgive me
And you keep saying you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

Now this home we have built is still standing
It's foundation is on solid ground
Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
Or burn it down

And told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson

And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell my that you love me too

And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say...

[Chorus]
I told you so, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees
And told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old-time feeling

Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely

And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned
And would you say...

When the fires of hell freeze over I won't need you anymore

Randy Travis,"Me and some of the boys were sitting around the other night
Started talking about politics, religion, love and life
And what a shame it was about 9/11
And what about hell and what about heaven
And is there or isn't there angels on earth
And then one guy said
Well you can take that for what it's worth
If it's something I can see or something I can touch
Well I might believe in all that stuff
So I just had to say to him

Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by?
No robe of white
No halo in site
Well you missed the most obvious thing
Man, are you blind?
Just look in your mothers eyes

And then I said who went through the pain
And smiled through the tears on the day of your birth?
She counted your fingers and toes and thank god you were whole
Son you outta know who loved you first, that's right
And who always came running every time you cried out
And how many more things have you forgotten about
And who tried their best to teach you wrong from right
And how many nights did she leave on the light
While she waited and prayed that you came in
And who'd be there for you right up to the end
Think about it tonight

Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by?
No robe of white

Aw man, are you blind?

Randy Travis,"My Grandpa farmed for a livin',
Content to live the simpler kind of life.
My Grandma worked in the kitchen,
Awfully proud to be that farmer's wife.
They used to say that they'd got everything that they need,
Each mornin' they wake up,
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

Here I am, ring on my finger,
Grandpa's little grandson, all grown up.
I found my rock and I plan to keep her.
I wish they were here to see the two of us.
They'd proud to know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up,
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

With the highway twice as wide,
And the farmland sub-divided.
It's good to know that some things never change.
I'm still lovin' an I'm still livin',
By those simple words of wisdom:
Life an' love come down to just four things.

My Grandpa, Lord knows, I miss him,
An' the way that he and Grandma looked at life.
And each day, I count my blessings,
To have that kind of love here by my side.
No matter what, we know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up,
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

Yeah, we've got everything that we need,
Between the two of us,
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.",Four Walls
Randy Travis,"The first time I saw you
I felt weak inside
I searched my heart and mind
For words I couldn't find
Somehow you seemed to see
What came over me that night
As a love began to grow
That would last for all time

And you said,
I can see it in your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
Sometimes they say more
Than words could ever hold
We could wait a thousand lifetimes
And never feel like this again
But when you look at me that way
I can see it in your eyes

Later on I asked your hand
And I prayed the time was right
I knelt down on one knee
And said would you be my bride?
And the sound of silence
Filled the air
As your tears fell with mine
You didn't have to say a word
For me to realize

And I said,
I can see it in your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
I see dreams come alive
And future plans unfold
I could wait a thousand lifetimes
And not find a perfect love again
But when you look at me that way
I can see it in your eyes

Many years have come and gone
And what a life we've made
How again we search for words
As the heart inside me breaks
Until death do we part
Were the vows we made
And now the time has come
But goodbye is so hard to say

I can see it your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
The light of life is burning low
Soon you're leaving me I know
The time that's left is precious dear
So please don't shed another tear
You don't have to say a word
I can see it in your eyes

I've heard you say a thousand times
I'll love you dear until I die
But you don't have to say a word
I can see it in your eyes



",I Can See It in Your Eyes
Randy Travis,"If you want someone
Who'll always do his best
Who'll understand
Look no farther
Than across this room we're in

If you want someone
Who'll always stand by you
No matter where or when
I'm your man
Honey I'm your man

If you need someone
To hold you when the storms start closing in
Someone who'll protect you
Or walk with you hand in hand
If you think you'd like to be adored forever
By your best friend
I'm your man
Honey I'm your man

I thank god each day
For giving us each other
And for making dreams reality
By bringing us together

So if you want someone
Who'll love you now and forever
And be your best friend

Randy Travis,"My boss will tell you that I've been to work all week on time
That I ain't had no liquor on my breathe
Ain't no kinda' secret, I've been known to take a drink
And it's made me do some things that I regret

Loretta said this ain't no kind of way to raise a family
And one night she called it quits and called a cab
She left her clothes out on the clothes line
And the dishes in the sink
So I guess she knows that she ain't coming back

Well I just want to see my kids
I just want to hold my girls
Heaven knows I ain't got much of nothing else in this ole world
I just want to be around enough to know that they've been loved
I just want to be their daddy, my daddy never was

Now lately she's been knowin' this old boy she met in church
And I can't say she's wrong for wanting more
I gave him the right to tell my wife that I can't come around
The night I knocked a hole in her front door

And Loretta took my keys and she made me wait outside
But she didn't call the law she called a cab
And as I pulled away I saw something in her eyes
So I reckon that she knows I ain't so bad

I just want to see my kids
I just want to hold my girls

The anger deep in your heart
You're the only one that it's hurting
You're the one that it's tearing apart
I'm sorry that he broke your heart girl

Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and row

He broke all his promises too
With his little white lies he looked in your eyes
And made you believe they were true
Aw but this ain't the final curtain

Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and row

And self pity just ain't your style

You can stay blue or you can move on
Ain't it hard when you discover
Things ain't what you thought they would be
When all of your best played plans

I've seen em all day long from 4am till noon
Some are running from
Some are running too
Some are running blind

You don't know me from Adam

I said I got a plan you see I got it figured out
How can you be so sure my dear what I'm all about

I can tell your brand of beer

us a tank of gas

we'd go driving around

then man we dang sure did

own beer

just lucky we ain't dead

With a truck looked just like mine

A long time ago, Lazarus died

All hope seemed gone as his sisters cried

Jesus walked to where he laid

He called his name and he came out of the grave


Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?

you thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong, I?ve been set free


Oh, jesus hung on a rugged cross, he gave His life for a world once lost

He lay three days in a borrowed grave but when He came out I could hear Him say


Oh death, where thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?

You thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong, I?ve been set free


One day I?ll lay this body down, they?ll dress me up and put me in the ground

But when Jesus comes in the sky, just listen close and you?ll hear me cry


Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?

Randy Travis,"So many times I question the certain circumstances 
And things I could not understand.
Many times in trials my weakness blurs my vision 
And that's when my frustration gets so out of hand.
It's then I am reminded, I've never been forsaken.
I've never had to stand one test alone.
As I look at all the victories, the Spirit rises up in me.
And It's through the fire my weakness is made strong.

He never promised that the cross would not get heavy
And the hill would not be hard to climb.
He never offered a victory without fighting.
He said help would always come in time.
Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision
And the advisory says give in, Just hold on.
Our Lord will show up (Yeah)
And He will take you through the fire again

I know within myself that I would surly perish
If I trust the hand of God, He'll shield the flame again.

And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time
You've been gone so long that it's hard to recall
Just how the dream went
And all but this broken heart in me I guess is doing fine

Is it still over, are we still through
Since my phone still ain't ringing I assume it still ain't you
I've half a mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you

That lie that I tried to slip by you
Was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you
And protect you from the truth
Half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of pure prevention
And trying to explain while I'm insane
Is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do

You could hear a woman cry in the alleyway that night on the streets of David's town
And the stable was not clean and the cobblestones were cold
And little Mary full of grace with tears upon her face had no mother's hand to hold

It was a labor of pain, it was a cold sky above
But for the girl on the ground in the dark with every beat of her beautiful heart

No midwives to be found on the streets of David's town in the middle of the night
So he held her and he prayed, shafts of moonlight on his face
But the baby in her womb, he was the maker of the moon
He was the Author of the Faith that could make the mountains move

I was running from a clip on tie
it took daddy's belt to get me in my Sunday's best

Lord suffer would go on past
Cracker crumbs and a little shot glass
I was starving to death because I didn't know Jesus yet

But I was saved by a month old Twinkie in my corduroy coat
When every head bowed, every eyed closed

Amazing grace
Don't make a sound
Or mama's going to wear that back side out, 
While shouting Hellulaj
If you raised your hand
Or came on down
To repent of your sins
They'll be a little kid
Staring a hole right through you
But I was no angel 
So i wasn't going to throw no stone
When every head bowed, every eye closed

Pass a plate in 'Alter call'
Every verse if I surrender all
Squirming in my seat
Tummy growling like a grizzly bear

Hit the door as the service closed
Hoped in the car, burned up the road
To the KFC
Because I'm going to beat the Catholics there

While they were still confessing|
We were blessing our mashed potatoes
With every head bowed, every eye closed

While daddy says grace
Put that fork back down
Or mama's going to wear that back side out, 
While shouting Hellulaj
I could have sworn 
I lost 15 pounds
Lust for finger licking
Greasy fried chicken 
Burns a whole right through you
While daddy's still praying
Everybody's dinner done got cold

Randy Travis,"He tore down the work of 17 years brick by brick
And stone by stone
No hammer was swingin' cause cheatin' and drinkin'
Don't need no help wreckin' a home
Ah, but when he came back through the dust and the rubble
Of what he had once called his life
He dropped to his knees in sheer disbelief of the total destruction inside

There were empty closets and empty drawers
And a tear stained note on the kitchen floor
And burning memories in the fireplace
He waited too late to say he was wrong
His house was still standing but his home was gone
Brother, you would not believe
What you can see from your knees

Right then and there in an old sinner's prayer
He told things he'd kept in the dark
There was no use in lying cause the man who was listening
Could see every room in his heart
Ah, he took empty whisky bottles, little black book and all
To the fire she left on the grate
Ah, sometimes a man will change on his own
But sometimes I tell you it takes

Empty closets and empty drawers
And a tear stained note on the kitchen floor

So I tripped and fell a lot
Learning what true love was not
Till one evening Mama said we ought to talk

She said love is a gamble
It's a chance that you take
You lay your heart down
And you bet it won't break
You bet your sweet dreams
Won't get tattered and torn
But when that happens
You must shake off those blues
Just remember you've got nothing to lose
But you've had true love since the day you were born
Since the day you were born

Then she told me all she knew
About what makes true love true
And it hasn't much to do with heat
Young hearts race and then grow still
Passion cools and always will
But a river just keeps filling up the sea

You see love is a gamble
It's a chance that you take
You lay your heart down
And you bet it won't break
You bet your sweet dreams
Won't get tattered and torn
But when that happens
You must dream up some more
When you find it you'll have seen it before
But you've had true love
Since the day you were born

Love is a gamble
It's a chance that you take
To lay your heart down
And you bet it won't break
You bet your sweet dreams
Won't get tattered and torn
But when that happens
You must shake off those blues
And just remember you got nothing to lose
You've had true love
Since the day you were born
Since the day you were born",Love Is a Gamble
Randy Travis,"Your hand was wrapped around th ebottle
Your arm wrapped around her waist
You were running at full throttle
Big smile across your face

You were the life of the party
But it was all in your mind
I hate to be the one to tell you
You didn't have a good time

well I bet you don't remember
Kneeling in that bathroom stall
Praying for salvation 
And cursing out the hall

The you went right back to drinking 
Like everything was fine
But let's be honest with each other 
You didn't have a good time

[Chorus]
So take a good hard look in the mirror
And drink that image down
I'm the truth you can't run from
I'm the conscious you can't grind
And the happiness you want so bad 
You ain't going to find
Until you start believing
You didn't have a good time

When you woke up this morning
I guess you just assumed
That you got something out of
The empty bottles in this room

There ain't an angel that can save you
When you're listening to the wise
And the demons they won't tell you 
You didn't have a good time

[Chorus]

Somebody had to tell you
You didn't have a good time",You Didn't Have a Good Time
Randy Travis,"I saw a young white boy open up the door
For an old black lady who was walkin’ in the store
And it hit me, yeah, it me, things ain't all that bad

I saw a homeless man pull a dollar from his shoe
Slip it in the plate as it was passin’ down the pew
And I wondered, I couldn't help but wonder, was it the last he had

Oh, I believe that love’s alive and well
Though the way things are these days
Some say it’s hard to tell

And I've seen one little candle
Keep away the darkness all by itself
And that’s the reason why
I know love’s alive and well

They’d been together sixty-three years
Still they smile at each other and their eyes fill up with tears
Ain't that something, but ain't that how it's supposed to be

Oh, I believe that love’s alive and well
Though the way things are these days
Some say it’s hard to tell

And I’ve seen one little candle
Keep away the darkness all by itself
And that’s the reason why
I know love’s alive and well

Yeah, that’s the reason why
I know love’s alive and well

I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four
I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of bone
Yeah I've been settlin' alone diggin' up bones

Then I went to the jewelery and I found our wedding rings
I've put mine on my finger and I gave yours a flame
I crossed this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones

I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone

Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on

To make my love shine
Like a candle that burns in the night

Deeper and deeper inside

And all of the treasures
I found in your soul
Was like finding a diamond
When you're mining for coal

I've been a fool for glitter and gold
And women that sparkle shiny and cold
Like a statue carved out of ice
They shimmer like tinsel
On a blue Christmas night
But they never were quite so bright

As all of the treasures
That loving you holds
It's like finding a diamond
When you're mining for coal

With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down.

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday

Randy Waldman,"Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She had danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery,
Touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push shove world
But there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold connective heat
Struggling stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife
If the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Randy Weston,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it

You know I'm yours for just the taking

I just want you to know

Ranee Lee,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Ranee Lee,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love

Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away

What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

Que cayendo están cerca de mi
Al otoño gris lleno de sombras
Le preguntare que fue de ti
Nada soy sin Laura
Solo estoy sin su amor
Nada soy sin Laura, sin Laura
Sin Laura, sin Laura, sin Laura
Sin Laura
Sin su amor",Cuando Tu No Estas
Raphael,"Yo no he vuelto a encontrarla jamas 
Desde aquel día 
De su vida no se que sera 
Desde aquel día 
Es posible que tenga otro amor 
Una nueva ilusión 
O quizás llorara 
O quizás llorara 
O quizás llorara 
Desde aquel día 

Sus palabras de amor donde irán 
Desde aquel día 
Y de noche con quien sonara 
Desde aquel día 
Es posible que este como yo 
Recordando mi amor 
Sin poderme olvidar 
Sin poderme olvidar 
Sin poderme olvidar 
Desde aquel día 

Ninguno de los dos hacemos nada por volver 
Y no nos vemos 
Y no nos vemos 
Desde aquel día 
Ninguno de los dos recordaremos el ayer 
Y nos queremos

De no hablarme de ella aun 
Todavía es muy pronto y la sueno

Donde ella conmigo no estuvo 
Donde nada recuerde algo suyo

Donde nada me invita el recuerdo

Presiento que esta noche
Perfumara el suspiro
Que al fin de tu pecho hoy escapara

Escucha la canción que con amor cantando va el gondolero
En ella está diciendo y expresando todo lo que te quiero
Y deja que lo arrulle nuestro idilio con un beso que dure una eternidad
Con el agua se despertara en cuanto amanezca

Recuerdas cuanto tiempo
Buscamos el momento
De acariciarnos con soñada pasión

Hoy que la noche es nuestra
Abrázame y si el mundo comienza
O termina que importa a los dos

Y escucha la canción que con amor cantando va el gondolero
En ella está diciendo y expresando todo lo que te quiero
Y deja que lo arrulle nuestro idilio con un beso que dure una eternidad

A veces llegan cartas con olor a espinas que no son románticas

Son cartas que te hablan de que en la distancia el amor se muere

A veces llegan cartas que te hieren dentro, dentro de tu alma
A veces llegan cartas con sabor a gloria
Llenas de esperanza
A veces llegan cartas con olor a rosas que si son fantásticas

Son cartas que te dicen que regreses pronto que desean verte
Son cartas que te hablan de que en la distancia el cariño crece
A veces llegan cartas que te dan la vida
Que te dan la calma

Son cartas que te dicen que regreses pronto
Que desean verte
Son cartas que te hablan de que en la distancia el cariño crece
A veces llegan cartas que te dan la vida, que te dan la calma

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring

The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Raphael,"Yo tenía mi vida llena
Había dicha en cualquier rincón
Siempre estaba mi alma abierta
Por si ella pedía amor

Yo tenía mis manos llenas
Y vacías me las dejo
Que la busquen por donde sea
Y me de lo que se llevo

Detenedla ya, que es una ladrona, detenedla ya
Detenedla ya, que es una ladrona, detenedla

Que se ha robado el sueño de mis ojos
Y me ha dejado noches que no acaban
Que se ha llevado de mi vida todo
Por no dejar no me ha dejado nada

",Detenedla Ya
Raphael,"¿Dónde está nuestro amor?
No sé bien cuál fue el error
Y aunque duela la verdad
Nunca tiene vuelta atrás

Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

For restless eyes egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
But and love is overboard

Tú por mí, yo por ti
Intentando descubrir
Que lección se nos paso

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it
Lessons in love, lost without love

Lessons in love, me duele la verdad
Lessons in love, y busco una señal
Lessons in love, me dices que te vas
Lessons in love, y yo no sé olvidar

",Lessons in Love (Pierde el Amor)
Raphael,"Se abre una ventana interior
Es una historia de amor que se ha ido
Todo fue un momento, ayer
Hoy que quiero volver te persigo

Necesito lo que tú me das
Necesito verte un día más
Y sólo pienso en ti
Sólo en ti

Ella ya no cree en el amor
Es sólo una diversión, un fracaso
Todo junto a ella es fingir
Y siento ganas de huir a tus brazos

Necesito lo que tú me das
Necesito verte un día más
Y sólo pienso en ti
Sólo en ti

Va pasando el tiempo
Y no sé de lo que fue aquella vez
¿Que ha quedado?
Te habrás olvidado de mí
Mientras vivo por ti obsesionado

Necesito lo que tú me das
Necesito verte un día más
Y sólo pienso en ti
Sólo en ti

",Only You (Solo en Ti)

Raphael,"Noche, noche de ronda
Que triste pasas,
Que triste cruzas
Por mi balcón.
Noche de ronda,
Ay, cómo me hieres,
Como lastimas
Mi corazón.

Luna que se quiebra
Sobre la tiniebla de mi soledad.
A dónde, a dónde vas?
Dime si ésta noche
Tu te vas de ronda como ella se me fue.
Con quién está?

Dile que la quiero,
Dile que me muero de tanto esperar.
Que vuelva ya.
Que las rondas no son buenas.
Que hacen daño, que dan penas.
Que se acaba por llorar.

Raphael,"Somos un sueño imposible
Que busca la noche
Para olvidarse del tiempo
Why de tanto reproche

Somos en nuestra quimera
Doliente why querida
Dos hojas que el viento
Junto en el otoño ¡Ay!

Somos dos seres en uno
Que amando se mueren
Para guardar en secreto
Lo mucho que quieren

Pero, ¿qué importa la vida
Con esta separación?
Somos dos gotas de llanto
En una canción

Somos un sueño imposible
Que busca la noche
Para olvidarse del tiempo
Why de tanto reproche

Somos en nuestra quimera
Doliente why querida
Dos hojas que el viento
Junto en el otoño ¡Ay!

Somos dos seres en uno
Que amando se mueren
Para guardar en secreto

Somos dos gotas de llanto

Pero, ¿qué importa la vida
Con esta separación?
¡Somos dos gotas de llanto

Raphael,"Cómo han pasado los años
Cómo cambiaron las cosas
Y aquí estamos lado a lado
Como dos enamorados
Como la primera vez

Cómo han pasado los años
Qué mundo tan diferentes
Y aquí estamos frente a frente
Como dos adolescentes
Que se miran sin hablar

Si parece que fue anoche
Que bailamos abrazados
Y juramos un ""te quiero""
Que nos dimos por entero
Y en secreto murmuramos
""Nada nos va a separar""

Cómo han pasado los años
Las vueltas que dio la vida
Nuestro amor siguió creciendo
Y con él, nos fue envolviendo
Habrán pasado los años
Pero el tiempo no ha podido
Hacer que pase lo nuestro

Si parece que fue anoche
Que bailamos abrazados
Y juramos un ""te quiero""

Raphael,"Han nacido en mi rancho dos arbolitos, 
Dos arbolitos que parecen gemelos, 
Y desde mi casita los veo solitos, 
Bajo el amparo santo y la luz del cielo. 

Nunca están separados uno del otro, 
Porque así quiso Dios que los dos nacieran, 
Y con sus mismas ramas se hacen caricias, 
Como si fueran novios que se quisieran. 

Arbolito, arbolito, bajo tu sombra, 
Voy a esperar que el día cansado vuelva, 
Y cuando estoy solito, mirando al cielo, 
Pido pa' que me mande una compañera. 

Arbolito, arbolito, 
Me siento solo, 
Quiero que me acompañes, 
Hasta que muera.",Dos Arbolitos
Raphael,"Todo pasa y todo queda
Pero lo nuestro es pasar
Pasar haciendo caminos
Caminos sobre la mar

Nunca perseguí la gloria
Ni dejar en la memoria 
De los hombres mi canción
Yo amo los mundos sutiles
Ingrávidos y gentiles
Como pompas de jabón

Me gusta verlos pintarse 
De sol y grana, volar 
Bajo el cielo azul, temblar 
Súbitamente y quebrarse

Nunca perseguí la gloria

Caminante, son tus huellas 
El camino y nada más
Caminante, no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar

Al andar se hace camino 
Y al volver la vista atrás 
Se ve la senda que nunca 
Se ha de volver a pisar

Caminante no hay camino 
Sino estelas en la mar

Hace algún tiempo en ese lugar 
Donde hoy los bosques se visten de espinos 
Se oyó la voz de un poeta gritar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso 

Murió el poeta lejos del hogar
Le cubre el polvo de un país vecino
Al alejarse le vieron llorar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso 

Cuando el jilguero no puede cantar
Cuando el poeta es un peregrino
Cuando de nada nos sirve rezar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso",Cantares
Raphael,"Mírame
En nada me consigo concentrar
Ando despistado todo lo hago mal
Soy un desastre y no sé
Que está pasando
Me gustas a rabiar yo te deseo
Me llegas a desesperar
Es tan grande lo que siento por ti
Que tenerte no bastará
Que esto que me invita a vivir
Que me da la ilusión
Que será esa fuerza
Que a todos nos une de dos en dos
Será la fuerza del corazón

Hace que
Te abrace y los cuerpos lleguen a estorbar
Tiemblo sólo con la idea de rozar
Tus labios llenos de besos nuevos
No puedo dormir robas mi tranquilidad
Alguien ha bordado
Tu cuerpo con hilos de mi ansiedad
De cinturón tus piernas cruzadas
De mi espalda un reloj
Donde tus dedos son las agujas
Se dan cuerda a este motor
Que es la fuerza del corazón

Y es la fuerza que te lleva
Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento casi una obsesión
Si la fuerza es del corazón
Es algo que te lía la descarga de energía
Que te va quitando la razón
Te hace tropezar te crea confusión
Seguro que es la fuerza del corazón
Es la fuerza que te lleva

No puedo pensar
Tendría que cuidarme más
Como poco pierdo la vida y luego me la das
Que es lo que va cegando al amante
Que va por ahí de señor
Y no es mas que un chiquillo travieso
Provocador será la fuerza del corazón

Y es la fuerza que te lleva
Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento casi una obsesión

Raphael,"Me calaste hondo
Y ahora me dueles
Si todo lo que nace perece, del mismo modo
Un momento se va
Y no vuelve a pasar

Y decían: ""¡qué bonito!"" era vernos pasear
Queriéndonos infinito
Pensaban: ""siempre será igual""
¿Cómo lo permitimos, qué es lo que hicimos tan mal?
¿Fue este orgullo desgraciado
Que no supimos tragar?
Engáñame un poco al menos
Dí que me quieres aún más
Que durante todo este tiempo
Lo has pasado fatal
Que ninguno de esos idiotas te supieron hacer reír
Que el único que te importa
Es este pobre infeliz

Me calaste hondo
Y ahora me dueles
Si todo lo que nace perece, del mismo modo
Un momento se va
Y no vuelve a pasar

Y el día que yo me muera y moriré antes que tú
Sólo quiero que una pena
Se lloré frente a mi ataúd
Que esta herida en mi alma no llegó a cicatrizar
Y estará desesperada
Hasta que te vea llegar

Me calaste hondo
Y ahora me dueles
Si todo lo que nace perece, del mismo modo
Un momento se va
Y no vuelve a pasar
Un momento de va
Y no vuelve a pasar
Un momento se va",Infinito

Que yo sin tu amor.. me muero

Despacio y en silencio sin saber
Si todo lo que he dado te llego a tiempo

y no tener un nombre
Que decirle al viento

correr despacio sobre mi piel,

Vente conmigo al huerto 
que están las rosas 
queriendo ver la promesa 
que has roto para volver 
why así creer lo que les conté. 

Dije que te quería 
como a nada en el mundo. 
Que seguía tus pasos, 
tu caminar, como un lobo en celo 
desde mi hogar 
con la puerta abierta de par en par, 
de par en par. 

Que tenía en penumbra 
nuestro rincón 
en aquel salón con dos cubiertos 
why tu canción 
why con tus flores en el jarrón. 

Siento tu mano tibia 
que palmo a palmo besa mi piel 
why tus brazos me enredan hoy como ayer; 
en este nuevo día vuelvo a creer. 

Vente conmigo al puerto 
que hay una barca en el malecón 
con tu nombre pintado secando al sol, 
con tu mano grabada junto al timón. 

Sabes que te quería 
como a nada en el mundo… 

Que tenía en penumbras 
nuestro rincón… 

Quiero abrazarte tanto 
con mis sentidos, con tanto amor 
que no haya más sonido que nuestra voz 
mi cuerpo en el tuyo a continuación. 

why yo andaré la tierra 
como un romero buscando a un dios 
why tendré tu regazo, tu comprensión 
why una casa pequeña para los dos.

De intercambio de parejas
E interiores con alcobas;
Entre música y penumbra,
Baile y humo, charla y copa,

Hasta ver amanecer
Y esa piel de canela, de bronce, de miel?
Y esa piel de canela, de bronce, de miel?

Al salir de aquella cueva,
Ya con luz de la mañana,
Ya sin rimmel que enmascara,
Al besarla me di cuenta
Que esa diosa, que ese cielo,
Que esa luna era lucero
Me callé, no dije nada
Y al partir me pregunté,

En el vuelo de mi vida
Quien trazó mi ruta, mi sendero, mi camino

Trabajé mi suerte
Con delirio día a día
Tropecé mil veces y aprendí a volar

Imité el esfuerzo
La constancia de las olas
Que desgastan a las rocas
Siendo agua, nada más

Preferí la gloria
A una vida sin sentido
Pero no es de rosas
El camino hasta llegar

Pero eso nada importa
Se asomaron a mi cuna
Por si acaso había basura
Propia y fácil de airear

Y encontraron tras mi puerta
Los amores que me arropan
Cuatro estrellas, mis recuerdos, mis canciones
Donde grito toda toda mi verdad

Trabajé mi suerte
Con delirio día a día
Tropecé mil veces, y aprendí a volar

Y encontraron tras mi puerta
Los amores que me arropan
Cuatro estrellas, mis recuerdos, mis canciones
Donde grito mi verdad

Pero eso nada importa
Se asomaron a mi cuna
Por si acaso había basura
Propia y fácil de airear
Y encontraron tras mi puerta
Los amores que me arropan
Cuatro estrellas, mis recuerdos, mis canciones
Donde grito toda toda mi verdad",Cuatro Estrellas
Raphael,"Cuantas veces cuando estamos enfadados
Me dan ganas de arroparte entre mis brazos
Y cubrirte toda entera
Beso a beso
Y decirte vida mía, lo que siento
Pero no nos escuchamos
Pues perdemos la razón
Amor mío
Cuando estamos enfadados

Cuantas veces he querido confesarte
Que es posible que quizás me equivoqué
Y pedirte por favor que callemos de una vez
Que en el fondo nos amamos como nadie
Y barrer cristales rotos, ¡tantos dardos!
Porque sé lo que sufrimos enfadados

Qué locura
Cuanta sarta de improperios
Van cubriendo de basura
Nuestros sueños
Pero no nos escuchamos
Pues perdemos la razón
Amor mío
Cuando estamos enfadados

Cuantas veces cuando estamos enfadados
Olvidamos nuestra humana condición
Y entre tanta sinrazón
Puro aullido en vez de voz
Se reciente nuestro amor
Se enquista el alma
Y el otoño con sus sombras se adelanta
Amor mío, cuando estamos enfadados

Qué locura
Cuanta sarta de improperios
Van cubriendo de basura
Nuestros sueños
Pero no nos escuchamos
Pues perdemos la razón
Amor mío, cuando estamos enfadados

Raphael,"Eso que llaman amor
Es un ser vivo
Que vuela sin rumbo
Buscando posarse
En algún corazón
Aun desnudo
Posarse en el tuyo
A la vez que en el mio
Depende la suerte
El azar o el destino
No existen coartadas
Programas previstos
Si te llega te llega
Y empieza el delirio

Eso que llaman amor
Que disfrazamos
De ángel con alas
Desnudo
Con arco
Con flechas
Directas al alma
Que vienen del cielo
De algún paraíso
A darnos la vida
La gloria
La dicho
El placer mas divino

Pues eso que llaman amor
Que ya viene
Cuajado de llamas
Que ríos ni mares
Apagan
El hombre
Tan torpe y tan necio
De un soplo lo extingue
Lo hiere
Lo mata

Eso que llaman amor
Que nos llega
Quemando por dentro
Lo enfrían los días
El tiempo
Se hielan los besos
O surge otro sueño
Que acaba

Raphael,"Ella es así
Ella es así
Vuelve siempre a sucumbir

En el lago azul estaba 
Deshojando margaritas 
Y jugándose a una carta 
Si la muerte, si la vida 
Y la quise disuadir 
Con la variedad de verdes
Con las hojas que se mueven 
Al capricho de la brisa 
Plateadas por el sol

Terminamos viendo cine
Compartiendo nuestro aliento 
Y entre beso, beso y beso
Palomitas de maíz 
Ya no hablamos más del lago 
Ni de aquellas margaritas
Fue aferrándose a la vida 
Y volviendo a sonreír 
Y volviendo a sonreír 
Y volviendo a sonreír

Ya en mi hogar revolotea
Es mi amiga, compañera
Mi amuleto de la suerte
Talismán, mi buena estrella
Mi alegría, mi adicción 
Yo su agua calentita 
En las noches frías de invierno
Yo su apoyo, su pañuelo
Su cobija, su edredón

Pero nunca se le olvida 
Que es juguete de la vida 
Y sin más desaparece 
Y se me enreda por ahí 
Con cualquiera que la mira
Con la voz que la enamora 
Y en su noche blanca y loca 
Vuelve siempre a sucumbir
Vuelve siempre a sucumbir
Vuelve siempre a sucumbir

Ella es así
Ella es así
Vuelve siempre a sucumbir
Vuelve siempre a sucumbir

Vuelve siempre a sucumbir

y aparece una mañana 
De volar desengañada
Piel ajada, piel sin brillo
Un despojo sin sentido
Arco iris sin color 
Y le curo las heridas 
De su alma con mi vida
Aunque sé que es su destino
Que no tiene solución

Pero nunca se le olvida 
Que es juguete de la vida 
Y sin más desaparece 
Y se me enreda por ahí 
Con cualquiera que la mira
Con la voz que la enamora 
Y en su noche blanca y loca

Raphael,"Ellas crean en las noches paraísos
Y sostienen con amor el universo
Y a la vez no regatean el esfuerzo
Y laboran en mil frentes si es preciso
Y le arañan lo que pueden a las horas
Y se ocupan de la dieta y de sus nidos,
No abandonan a sus seres mas queridos
Y aun les sobra humor y tiempo y se decoran

De ellas, el mundo será de ellas
Y todo el poder de ellas
Se nota, se siente, ya es mas que evidente
Que el mundo será de ellas

De ellas, el mundo será de ellas,

Son diosas de hierro con manos de seda,
El mundo será de ellas

Ellas siembran los talleres de alegría
Y transforman los despachos con aromas
Por cambiar el sin sentido
Tienen prisa por salir y liberarse de las sombras
No razonan el amor si se enamoran
Y se dan sin condiciones y se entregan
Pero rugen cuando el mal la atropella
Las deprecia, las golpea, las deshonra

De ellas, el mundo será de ellas

Y será negra en vez de blanca la Navidad
Y será negra en vez de blanca la Navidad

Como el tiempo que implacable va pasando 
Como el humo tu cariño se me va

Este amor en realidad se ha ido muriendo 
Y por eso de mis manos se me va

Dónde irán

Des qui vous font frissonner
Qui font craquer la peau
Des mots pour calmer l´âme des pauvres
Ou pour piquer aux yeux de petits amoureux
Des mots encore et puis toujours
Heureux ou bien saignants ça dépend du discours
Qui crache à leur foi jusqu´en pleine figure
Pour ne dire rien d´autre qu'un mensonge de plus

Ah si j´avais su
Si j'avais su


Des mots dans les bouches les couloirs du métro
Des mots tout chauds de ce qu´on vient d'nous inventer
Et qu´il va nous en cuire
Qui va nous arriver
Qui raconterons comment on s´est qu´on se ferra bouffer
Des mots des vieux, usés
Des familles
Des mots sur le courage la vie et puis tout çà
Des mots sur le bonheur qui pour une autre fois
Et puisque y´a rien à dire
Fait le nous ton discours
Des mots pour flatter les petits animaux
Qui sont déjà bien bêtes à bouffer du foin
Des mots qu´on dit pour un bon locataire
Une bonne année pour vous, pour la terre entière

Ah si j´avais su
Si j'avais su

Des mots pour la petite fiancée
Celle qu´on aurait pas du laisser tomber
Avec son petit coeur qui rêve sur le pavé
Son petit regard qui sait plus où s'poser
Des mots pour la vente générale
Des mots encore en bouillis ou bien en drame
Des mots tout près pour les grands abattoirs
Et puiqu´il est bien mort fais- le nous ton discours

Des mots par plein de paquets pour nous rassurer

Peut etre bien jusqu'au bout
Au bout de ses rêves
Mais sur le bout des lèvres 
Reste le mauvais goût 
Monter en grade monter en graine
Et le mal qu'on se donne 
Quand ça monte de partout 
Qu'on se voit faire son trou 

A passer en pionniers 
Et à jouer des coudes 
On voit bien le paysage 
Mais au dernier palier 
Quand la tour s'écroule 
On oublie 
Ce qu'on fait ici 

Le rodéo ne s'arrête jamais 
Mais les cow-boys s'allongent 
Devenus veaux 
Et bien appliqués 
A tirer sur la longue 
Venez chercher venez chercher 
Les visas pour le rêve 
Car les derniers s'ront bons derniers 
Quinze mille pieds sous les bombes 

Les présidents-robots ont donné le signal 
C'est l'heure du passage 
Dans les peuples endormis du bout de la semaine 
On oublie 
De quoi il s'agit

Et des anges avec leurs trompettes
M'ont cloué au lit
Des mouches et des famines
Là dans ma chambre froide
Je crois j'étais malade

A rester là, assis, comme on en voit des pays
Des villes et des mondes, des hommes ou des bêtes
C'est comme ça qu'ils m'ont trouvé, qu'ils m'ont réveillé

Me réveillant ce matin, du mal à me lever
De la terre et du ciel, mais je suis pas causant
Me réveillant ce matin, personne pour m'énerver
De la terre et du ciel, pas vraiment pratiquant
Et je me souviens, petit, en bas des jambes, endormi
Et des pierres dans les bras

A rester là, assis, si j'en ai vu du pays
Des hommes ou des bêtes, des villes et des mondes
C'est comme ça qu'ils m'ont trouvé qu'ils m'ont emmené

Les voilà bien excités tout prêts à me déchirer
Ils ne me trouveront jamais 

Car je m'en vais, moi, rêver des prairies
Des villes et des mondes des hommes ou des bêtes
Tout était rêvé

Car je m'en vais moi rêver des prairies

J´ai donné la patte, j´ai mordu, dessiné des maisons, 
Je peux descendre du train en marche

Et suivez la musique Suivez la musique
Au peuple de vitesse pour garder la tête haute
Suivez la musique Je crois c´est pareil chez les autres

Tu avais promis tu avais promis de laisser la lumière 
Accroché au radiateur les ombres de la terre
Mais tout passe tout passe circulez Y a rien à voir

J´ai grandi trop vite et sans faire de manières
A l´ombre des géants verts
Et des secrets trop lourds qu'on porte comme on porte en terre
Avec ce que j´ai vu
Avec c'que j´ai rien dit
Il faut bien qu´on me punisse

J´ai prié pour les héros pour le drapeau 
Avalé la dragée du bon Jésus j´ai tout fait comme prévu
J'ai repris le dessus

Et suivez la musique Suivez la musique
Au peuple de vitesse pour garder la tête haute
Suivez la musique Tu seras un homme mon fils

C´est la nuit qui descend autour
C´est la nuit de septembre, des hautes tours
Et on tourne et on tourne sur les boulevards
sur l´amour qui revient tôt ou tard
C´ est la vie qui tourne quand les feux sont noirs 
Et qu´on se meurt

Chaque jour, chaque matin
On avance on se tient et la main dans la main
Et on tourne et on tourne on s´attache à nos cou
Et on tourne tout au tour de nos joues
C´est la vie qui tourne, elle va et elle vient
On le sait bien

C'n´est que la fin d´un jour 
Ou est-ce qu´on rentre mon amour
Est-ce qu´on sera ensemble toujours

La tempête nous fait frissonner
C´est le vent c´est le vent qui nous fait marcher
Mais la nuit mais la nuit n´en finit donc jamais
Comme elle tourne continue à se moquer
De la vie de la vie on serait passagers",1900
Raphaël,"Est-ce que j'en ai les larmes aux yeux
Que nos mains ne tiennent plus ensemble
Moi aussi je tremble un peu
Est-ce que je ne vais plus attendre

Est-ce qu'on va reprendre la route,
Est-ce que nous sommes proches de la nuit
Est-ce que ce monde a le vertige
Est-ce qu'on sera un jour puni

Est-ce que je rampe comme un enfant
Est-ce que je n'ai plus de chemise
C'est le Bon Dieu qui nous fait
C'est le Bon Dieu qui nous brise

Est-ce que rien ne peut arriver
Puis qu'il faut qu'il y ait une justice
Je suis né dans cette caravane
Et nous partons allez viens
Allez viens

Et parce que ma peau est la seule que j'ai
Que bientôt mes os seront dans le vent
Je suis né dans cette caravane
Et nous partons allez viens
Allez viens

Allez viens",Caravane
Raphaël,"Rêver d'océans 
Rêver de pur-sang 
Mais on est dans le dur 
Pour cette vie c'est sûr 
Et après 
Et après 
Qui sait 

La peau sur les os 
et la croix dans le dos 
et des routes de nuit 
et des gens blanchis 
et des rêves 
Mais qu'on en crève 
Et pour rien 
Puisque tout tient 
Dans la main 

Je me suis réveillé ce matin 
Pour la rose d'un jardin 
Au coeur humain 
Encore humain 
A l'appel de nos noms on revient 
Comme on revient 
Et pourquoi 
Juste pour connaître la fin 

Qu'on est loin des Amériques 
Qu'on est loin des Amériques 
Je me suis perdu un million de fois",La Route de Nuit
Raphaël,"Sur la mappemonde à vol d'oiseau 
On se dit qu'on peut gagner gros 
Qu'on a le ciel dans une goutte d'eau 
On cherche tous un bon destin 
La vie s'écoule entre nos mains 
La joie la peine notre chemin 
Traverser la vie sans billet de train 
Traverser la vie sans billet de train 

Sur la route

La solitude la mauvaiseté 
Ça fait rêver la liberté 
Jurer qu'on ne s'ennuiera pas 
Quand on aura du bien, tu vois 
Et ce bonheur qui nous traverse 
Pour un simple morceau de pain 
Si tu as faim prends le mien 

Si c'est pas l'Amérique 
Ça y ressemble bien 

Des fois j'aimerais être un oiseau 
Pour pouvoir cracher de plus haut 
Voir les maisons et les campagnes 
Et mieux leur tourner le dos 
On ira vendre nos sacs de roses 
On prendra le train du matin 
Sur tous les murs y'aura écrit 
De la justice pas la vengeance 
De la justice pas la vengeance 

Sur la route",Sur la Route
Raphaël,"Longtemps sur les chemins
La nuit est encore loin
Marcher jusqu'à user
Voyager sans billet
Un œil à la lucarne
La grande ville
Et défiler les rêves
Le soleil dans les reins
Les voilures gonflées
La rumeur des quartiers
Aux étoiles de papiers
Dans le grand désert
A la file indienne

Comme un homme à la mer
Allez  Dis- la nous ta prière
Et allons plus loin mon frère

Dis c'est quand qu'on revient 

Marcher dans les blés lourds
Sur la ligne de front
Au-dessous du volcan
Au-devant des maisons
Mon amie, mon amour
C'est le grand bond en avant
Dont nul ne revient
Nul ne connaît la fin

Et un homme à la mer
Allez  Dis la nous ta prière
Et allons plus loin mon frère

Dis c'est quand qu'on revient 

Tous les équipages
Fini le voyage
Morts d'insomnie
Dans la nuit de garde
Si jamais je m'égare
Mon amour mon amie

Et un homme à la mer
Comme un homme à la mer
Comme un homme à la mer
Allez  Dis la nous ta prière
On est bien amers",Comme un Homme a la Mer
Raphaël,"Il y a toujours des gens qui s'aiment 
Et qui se retrouvent sur le quai 
Ou l'on s'embrasse 
Mais comme tu m'as manqué 
D'autres qui ne savent ou aller 

Il y a toujours un air d'orage 
Et jours de pluie et jours mauvais 
Juste une seconde pour t'enlacer 
Et je te regarde passer 

La-bas La-bas 

Il y a toujours des rues en rouge 
Et des campagnes de rage 
Et de l'amours toujours blessé 
Et des enfants pour caresser 

Il y a toujours une fanfare 
Il y a toujours quelqu'un qui part 
Dans les maisons dans les gares 
Des avions qui n'arrivent jamais 

La-bas La-bas 

Au siecle des fumées 
Qu'il est loin le pays du lait et du miel 
Jamais j'y arriverais sans toi 
La-bas La-bas

Raphaël,"Elisa, Elisa, Elisa, saute-moi au cou.
Elisa, Elisa, Elisa, cherche-moi des poux.
Enfonce bien tes ongles et tes doigts délicats
Dans la jongle de mes cheveux, Lisa.
Elisa, Elisa, Elisa, saute-moi au cou.

Fais-moi quelques anglaises et la raie au milieu.

Raphaël,"Tu vois ce qu’on voit qui s’ébranle?
Nan, tu vois pas.

Tu n’es pas dans l’ombre,
Pas dans le triangle.

Comme quand tu faisais du zèle,
Comme quand je te volais dans les plumes,
Entre les dunes.
Par la porte entrebâillée,
Je te vois rêver,
A des ébats qui me blesse,
A des ébats qui ne cesse.

Peu à peu tout me happe,
Je me dérobe, je me détache,
Sans laissé d’auréoles,
Les cymbales, les symboles
Colle, on se rappelle, on se recolle.
Peu à peu tout me happe.

Le vent de l’orgueil,
Peut apaiser
Peut apaiser
Une poussière dans l’œil,
Et le monde entier soudain se trouble.

Comme quand tu faisais du zèle,
Comme quand je te volais dans les plumes,
Entre les dunes.
Par la porte entrebâillée,
Je te vois rêver,
Des romans fleurs asséchées,
Où Jadis on nageait.

Peu à peu tout me happe,
Je me dérobe, je me détache,
Sans laissé d’auréoles,
Les cymbales, les symboles

Nan, tu vois pas.",Happe
Raphaël,"Dans un petit avion aux ailes de toile
Tourné vers les étoiles, je me suis envolé
Dans un petit avion, je me suis posé
C'était vers Concordia dans une autre vallée

Deux enfants m'ont guidé
Car j'ai brisé ma roue
Voyez-vous, la nuit en-dessous
Sous mon ombre portée
Un village est perché
Pouvez-vous m'aider, le pouvez-vous?

Dans un petit avion, j'emmenais le soleil
Lorsque je suis tombé dans un océan bleu
Je dors dans un écrin, la joue sur une hélice
L'Afrique est mon amie dans le froid matin
Voyez-vous, ces soleils et ces champs de blé
Au-dessous de mes ailes, c'est là que je suis né

Deux enfants m'ont guidé
Car j'ai brisé ma roue
Voyez-vous, la nuit en-dessous
Sous mon ombre portée
Un village est perché
Pouvez-vous m'aider, le pouvez-vous?

Raphaël,"Elle se fend plus d´une robe longue
Sur le côté
La petite fille de Susie Wong
Voit sa vie débridée

Des doc´ à la place des tongs, 
Brûle les dragons de papier
Qu´elle glisse sous sa jonque
Fond de cour, escalier B

J´aimerais dormir sur ses nattes
A l´abri des paravents
Lire mon avenir dans ses cartes
Tant qu´il est encore temps
Le soir, au fond de sa jonque
Fond de cour, escalier B
J´ai le cœur délicat
Je sais comment il bat

J´aim'rais la mettre sur la paille
Ça nous changerait des trottoirs
Où je la vois qui s´éloigne
Le soir, au fond des dortoirs

J´irais dans sa jonque
J´oublierais ma honte
J´ai le cœur délicat
Je sais comment il bat

Je voudrais oublier sa jonque

Raphaël,"Je t´écris de mon lit d´hôpital
Où je me remets doucement
De mon accident, 
Transformer ma chambre en cargo

En pique-nique dingue
Les fêtes de l´automne, du tonnerre, 
Une tabagie dans les couloirs
Et les petites infirmières

Et les petits plats, hum, t´y croirais pas
Et dès que je pourrai marcher
J´irai à la fenêtre
Prendre les premiers rayons du printemps

Mon vieux copain, j´ai essayé d´imaginer
A quoi pouvait ressembler cette ville il y a mille ans
Avant les périphériques, les publicités, et tout ça, 
C´était sûrement très bien

J´imagine qu´il y avait des champs et du vent et des étoiles
Je me réjouis de te revoir, de te parler, 
De faire bouger ce vrai pantin de bois
Depuis quelques semaines, les peupliers se répondent dans la cour

Du sommeil il m´en faut pas plus, 
Dès que je pourrai marcher, nous serons loin, 
Le désert sibérien, où tu voudras
Et je laisse la ville et ses rumeurs au milieu du lit défait, 
De tout ce blanc, 
Je t´attends pour de bon mon vieux copain

Je meurs des choses pour lesquelles je n´ai pas su mourir
Je meurs des choses pour lesquelles je n´ai pas su mourir
Je sais bien que la Terre est ronde
Je sais bien que la Terre est ronde
So long, mon vieux copain
So long, mon vieux copain",Les Limites du Monde
Raphaël,"Le petit train de ma jeunesse
Le petit train s´en va
Au-dessus des toits
Lentement par les fenêtres, je le vois
Lentement et ne revient pas
Il n´y a rien à dire
Il n´y a rien à faire
Il n´y a rien à dire
Et je me fous

Du temps qui passe
Du temps qui presse
La maladie de ma jeunesse
Je n´ai jamais aimé d´autre personne que moi
Et pas même toi
Et j´étais si heureux avec toi
Et j´étais aussi heureux sans toi

Je me fous du vent
Qui vient, qui va
Je me fous de la vie
Qui finit ou pas
Je me fous de tes histoires de cinglés
Je me fous qu´il pleuve par le toit
Je me fous du malheur, du bonheur, de la joie
Et de tout ce temps qui s´en va
Je me fous des chansons tristes
Des clés qui ouvrent les serrures
Je me fous de la vie qui glisse
Je me fous de la terre refermée

Je me fous du karma des étoiles
Du soleil déglingué, des jours sans lendemain
Je me fous de tes chagrins
Je me fous du chagrin
Je me fous du chagrin

Le petit train de ma jeunesse
Le petit train s´en va
Se cogne et continue tout droit
Je n´avais besoin de personne
Et personne n´avait besoin de moi
Et j´ai abusé du temps et à présent
Voilà qu´il abuse de moi

Le petit train de ma jeunesse
Et je n´ai rien dit",Le Petit Train
Raphaël,"Je ferme les yeux quand c´est toi qui conduis
J´aime bien fermer les yeux et que le monde disparaisse
J´aime bien ma vodka du soir et l´odeur du kérosène
Est-ce que tu peux me raccompagner?

J´aime bien les taxis de nuit
Quand ils me ramènent à la maison
J´aimais bien notre histoire
Surtout la première année
T´embrasser dans les bars
Et ton pas dans l´escalier
Est-ce que tu peux me raccompagner?

J´aime bien les quartiers de lune
Et ta consolation
J´aimais bien me blottir contre toi
Dans le petit avion
Te regarder souffler sur les vitres
Et penser à ceux qui sont tombés
Est-ce que tu peux me raccompagner?

Montre-moi, montre-moi le monde du doigt
J´ n´ai pas vraiment souvenir de quand je roulais sous la table
Je baisse la vitre, je laisse la nuit entrer
Laisse-moi fermer les yeux et que le monde disparaisse
Laisse-moi au moins essayer
Laisse-moi au moins essayer

J´aime bien le cinéma quand c´est toi qui racontes la fin
Quand tu dis du bout des lèvres, quand tu me laves les cheveux
Quand tu crois que tout va bien
Que tu chasses la peur dans mes mains
Est-ce que tu peux me raccompagner?

Je ferme les yeux quand c´est toi qui conduis
J´aime bien fermer les yeux et que le monde disparaisse",Quand C'est Toi Qui Conduis
Raphaël,"Tess m'a dit veux tu m'embrasser ?
Tess me dit
Pourquoi me regardes tu ?
J'ai une épine dans le coeur
On ne m'a pas réveillée
J'ai grandi tout juste à coté des autres

Tess m'a dit je crois que je suis malade
Je n'aime pas cette ville
Qui ne comprends rien aux oiseaux
Tess me dit
Il est plus tard que tu ne le penses
J'ai grandi tout juste
Au milieu des autres

Je vais regarder la lune par dessus ton épaule
Je vais regarder la vie me faire vieillir
Crois- tu que je m'en sortirais
Si je te tournais le dos
Si je te tournais le dos 

Tess me dit 
De ne pas m'attacher
Tess me dit
Cette nuit je ne vais pas rêver
Tess me dit
Je m'attendais à tellement mieux
J'ai tout essayé
J'ai tout essayé

Je vais regarder la lune par dessus ton épaule
Je vais regarder la vie me faire vieillir

Un peu plus tard 
Un peu plus tôt

Raphaël,"C´était le temps d´une autre année
Le temps des néons allumés
Le temps des témoins des colombes
Le temps de la vitesse et de l´ombre
Le temps des lettres jetées au feu
Le temps où on était heureux

C´était le temps des bords de mer
Le temps des Gainsbourg des Prévert
Je revois tes cheveux défaits
Dans la chambre d´hôtel tu jouais
Et moi sur la banquette arrière
Je voyais le monde à l´envers

Que vive le vent de l´hiver
Et la chanson de Prévert
Continue sa route à l´envers
Je ne suis pas chrétien
Mais de tout je me souviens


Que vive le vent de l'hiver
et tout retourne à la terre
les loups sont à ma porte
un dernier coup d'oeil en arrière
dans le rétroviseur

C´était le temps de Lili Brik
Le temps du soleil tatoué
C´était le temps des avalanches
Le temps des verres bus et cassés
Ma vie brûlait comme la place rouge
Quand la nuit finissait sa course

C´était le temps des accords majeurs
Où tout était illuminé
Et j´entends battre ton coeur
Doucement doucement
Je ne suis pas soigné
C´était le temps de la Cantate
Le temps où tu la jouais pour moi

Vive le vent de l´hiver
Et la chanson de Prévert
Continue sa route à l´envers
Je ne suis pas chrétien
Mais de tout je me souviens

Vive le vent de l´hiver
Et tout retourne à la terre
Les loups sont à ma porte
Un dernier coup d´oeil en arrière
Dans le rétroviseur

et j'étais
sur les routes
par les nuits d'hiver
et j'étais sur les routes...",Le Vent de l'Hiver
Raphaël,"Tu dis que t’as pris une raclée
Dis-moi comment ont-ils pu rater ton œil?
Tu as l’air bien tenant
Tu as l’air mieux maintenant

For you I sigh, for you dear only

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it

You know I'm yours for just the taking

I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street

Raphael Gualazzi,"Apri gli occhi e te ne vai
La danza ?? immobile
Scopre i tuoi fianchi il vento
E nei giorni ogni momento
Vorrei percorrere
Le tue volute velleit?

Se solo avessi potuto cambiare il mondo all'improvviso
Avrei bruciato l'accidia immemore che porta il tempo
Avrei fermato la guerra inutile con un sorriso
E allora si avrei saputo credere

Posi libera nei sensi
La luce mormora dalla finestra stanca
La tensione dei silenzi sembra descrivere
Ogni tuo sguardo perso

Se solo avessi potuto cambiare il mondo all'improvviso
Avrei asciugato le nubi in lacrime per la tua gioia
Avrei sfondato le porte ipocrite di un paradiso
Avrei toccato quell'anima che vive dentro te

Sai, per sopravvivere
Ci basta un sogno
Sai, oh sai, per sopravvivere
Ci basta un sogno

E all'improvviso il tutto si delinea proprio come non avrei pensato mai
E nell'immagine, il respiro si distingue ora
Per ogni gioia, lacrima, ogni tuo sorriso sentirai una forza dentro te
Che vince ogni limite

Sai, per sopravvivere
Ci basta un sogno
Sai, oh sai, per sopravvivere
Ci basta un sogno, sai

You have never changed
Things are still the same as they were
And I've never known you

Now
As time goes by
Tears, hate and crying are not for me
They are not for me anymore
But if you have ears to listen and have eyes for crying
If you have somebody and soul, love me, let me die now

Sometimes I worry, oh, that I could be all alone again
Sometimes I worry, oh, that I could be all alone again
Sometimes I worry, oh, that I could be all alone again

Forever and more

And your heart for crying 
No one loves you more than me in this world

Forse anche Pertini per un poker con John Wayne

Eu vivia vestido de doirado
Palhaço das perdidas ilusões
Cheio dos guizos falsos da alegria
Andei cantando a minha fantasia
Entre as palmas febris dos corações

Nosso barracão no morro do Salgueiro
Tinha o cantar alegre de um viveiro
Foste a sonoridade que acabou
E hoje, quando do sol, a claridade
Forra o meu barracão, sinto saudade
Da mulher pomba-rola que voou

Nossas roupas comuns dependuradas
Na corda qual bandeiras agitadas
Pareciam um estranho festival
Festa dos nossos trapos coloridos
A mostrar que nos morros mal vestidos
É sempre feriado nacional

A porta do barraco era sem trinco
Mas a lua furando nosso zinco
Salpicava de estrelas nosso chão
Tu pisavas nos astros distraída
Sem saber que a alegria desta vida
É a cabrocha, o luar e o violão",Chão De Estrelas

And I knew there would be some time, when I would second guess my mind.

So I kept on walking, kept on striving,
Kept on singing and guess who showed up.

As I walked down the street one day, I thought I heard a brother say
'Living in bad conditions can make you feel like no one, 
As long as I, that's why I always try and do my best to search inside.
But I knew there would be a day, when I had to look the other way.

I told myself one day to falll on my knees and pray
And never listen to noone if they can't be true to you
No one should spend precious time living for material love
His money, no money no money, can make me happy.
Now it looks a lot clearer outside, 'cause I'm using my eyes.

'Cause I ain't never been down that road
The ghetto got a dirty name (the media pursued their flame)
But tell me who are they to really say?
It's not about the residents (damn what people think of them)
Bush is sitting cozy on the hill
So don't look down, look up high (don't let these people steal your pride)

It ain't all so political (black-on-black or physical)
But everybody's got to understand
See life ain't what it used to be (death is sowing many seeds)
Removing like we'll never see pain
I usually run through life but now (I act too quickly, slow it down)
But I never, ever compromised myself

And people, people... somebody's got to tell the truth

The government's the biggest pimp (they take their cut and leave you with)
Nothing at the end of the day
I'm searching for a solitude (but all I find is niggas who)
Smile and tell me lies to my face
The industry's no better cause (they only show you mad love)
When you're life and soul is living on the charts
But when you're luck is facing down (those ones, they are not around)

I put it down for all the ladies

I saw you holding Q Tip's hand
And girl **** near died

They way you hold that cosmo
Just fits you to a tee
But I just wish that you were sitting
Right next to me

I wonder what was on God's mind
The day that He made you
I know He wrote a new commandment
After He was through

But every time I see you
I find something new
But I just gotta have you

I really want you
I just gotta have you

At the serving spoon
And my partner skin it back
Was sitting with us too

Your body was in sight
I couldn't finish breakfast
Now something just ain't right

Now Snoop is looking like
What the **** is wrong with you?

(I'm still a man)
Have you ever loved somebody?
Somebody who, somebody who wants to treat you right, sugar
I'm still a man

Have you ever loved somebody
(Somebody, somebody who)
Somebody you wanna wake up in the morning
And just kiss him on the forehead?
Have you ever loved somebody?
(Have you ever loved somebody?)
Have you ever loved somebody?
Have you ever loved somebody?

Raphael Saadiq,"I don't wish you no bad luck baby
I don't wish you no strain
I only want to expose your life to 
The finer things
I offer you my company girl
You don't need no sympathy, just me
Some one who cares

Whatever you want
Girl you know I can provide
Whatever you need (whatever you need baby)
Call six three two twenty-one three five 

Now maybe I should drive right over
Show you my new ride
Or take you shopping out on the town
And then make you feel your best
I'll go out of my way to make sure you have everything
I want to be the one who will always be there
To give you

[Chorus: x2]

What makes you think I would try (To run a game on you)
Just as sure as my name is Dwayne (I'll be there for you and I'll)
Treat you just like a queen and give you fine things 
And you'll never have to worry about another (in your place)
Believe me when I say

[Chorus: x2]

Now you know I've never been the type to have 
A loss for words
So I tell you these feelings I have for you
They're all so true girl
I heard someone say that love can be so blind
I'll give you your space to go and you know I'll always be there for you

What makes you think I would try (To run a game on you)
Just as sure as my name is Dwayne (I'll be there for you and I'll)

Raphael Saadiq,"I put it down for the L-B-C
(I put it down for a place called Queens)
You know I represent the 213
(I hold it down for the big city)

I keep it gangsta for all my young G's
(All the P Y T's with their own car keys)
I put it down for all the ladies
(ladies, ladies, ladies)
It's all about you

I tried to look the other way
The day you passed me by
I saw you holding Q Tip's hand
And girl damn near died

They way you hold that cosmo
Just fits you to a tee
But I just wish that you were sitting
Right next to me

I wonder what was on God's mind
The day that He made you
I know He wrote a new commandment
After He was through

But every time I see you
I find something new
But I just gotta have you

I really want you
I just gotta have you
I really want you
I just gotta have you

Me and nephew snoop was eating
At the serving spoon
And my partner skin it back
Was sitting with us too

And all of a sudden
Your body was in sight
I couldn't finish breakfast
Now something just ain't right

Now Snoop is looking like
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I said, ""I know you understand""
You've been through a few
But this one was special, special to me
Is it my imagination killing me

You know my name
Abstract hits
And the bag top splits

My man need a lady
No matter the kind
A diamond shinning like you
You know is hard to find

Time brings change
And change brings time
My nephew want you
'Cause you so fine

A woman choose a man
It's a real mote
Make a choice 'cause me and Ray
We never have beef

Me and Snoop we go hard
Real macaroni's
Why you think that we want
To have this ceremony.

Raphael Saadiq,"I need a chick like you
One licks a lollipop
Manolo Blancs, it's hot
Her seven spit like heaven

A chic like you
Can move and shake it fast
Boys wait for her to pass
Because that girl is bad

Chic like you
She soaks in green tea lotion
Her legs are so outspoken
You'll think this girl is naked

Chic like you
The girl is always sexy
She loves backseats in taxis
And talking good and trashy

I mean the chic like you like just won't stop
Unbutton the top and later hear that k-k-knee drop
I could take you to the Opera and back to the block
Manolos and Gucci Lyn this chic is hot

For real and I mean sizzling hips get the twistness
Switchin' she keep all the playas whistling
She do the foo in bikinis and heels
The way she lick the bits and suck the ice and give a grown man chill

Oh girl when the attendant flip her own whips
Flew a playa the Vegas's for their own chips
Life of the party, the two step queen
She rapped when she seen me with them painted on jeans

You know I don't hit no better than her
Feel like I'm drunk when I see her and I slur my words
She's sexy and classy and she's my type
We can make it last forever just one night what they do, why, why

Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing
Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing

I need a chic like you
That don't know when to quit
Likes me to jump on it
And I just met her girlfriends

Chic like you
One with an open mind
Lets me eat cherry pie
Oh my, oh my, oh my

Chic like you
Will always keep me guessing
What's under that long jacket
I got this real bad habit

Now if this sounds like you
Girl, let me come inside
'Cause I think that you might be
My type, my type, my type, my type, my type, my type
You might be my type, my type, my type, my type, my type, my type

Raphael Saadiq,"What happened to the soul food?
What happened to the soul food?
I’m talkin' good eatin', good seasonin'

Out here in this world, (mind oh mind oh mind) just tryna make it (mind oh mind)
Everything I see (mind oh mind oh mind), sometimes I can't take it (mind oh mind)
But damn I really miss those times (mind oh mind oh mind)
(Mind oh mind) That soul food's on my mind (mind oh mind oh mind)
Mind, mind, mind

Grandma's hands used to usher Sunday mornings
Now before Sunday school, I hustle and I'm on it
I can't slow down, nah, a dollar and a dream
In this life you live, you're either the dealer or the fiend
Leanin' horizontal
The acrobats on the corner, they flip
So when them white vans pull up, Shawty, we dip
Out of view, could've been a track star at the school
But it took the police just to get that .44 out of you
Dash, sprint, hurdle, over those steel gates
They keep us in and keep folk out but we don't feel safe
As we used to back when we was in a booster
Watchin' our uncles drink coolers, talkin' pound-for-pound bruisers
Over rib bones
Now I sideways tote
How did Bobby Johnson hold it?
Pull the trigger 'til the clip gone
Potato tip, no potato salad
That American pie ain't even snappin'

Out here in this world, (mind oh mind oh mind) just tryna make it (mind oh mind)
Everything I see (mind oh mind oh mind), sometimes I can't take it (mind oh mind)
But damn I really miss those times (mind oh mind oh mind)
(Mind oh mind) That soul food's on my mind (mind oh mind oh mind)
Mind, mind, mind

Aromas on the corner, these the soul, they say
Some greens just can't be cleaned and you can't wash out the taste
Of rotten roots
Salted looks and herbs if it ain't made with love then it ain't fit to serve, I heard
Some get bruised and battered
Thrown away half eaten as if their seeds never ever mattered
It ain't ripe, it ain't right
That's why most people don't make love no more
They just fuck and they fight
What happened to the stay-togethers?
Die with you, and that means forever
Grandparents had that kind of bond
But now we on some other shit
Nah, we ain't got no rubbers here
I know she creepin' so that ain't my son
Apples fall off of trees and roll down hills
We can't play games no more 'cause we got bills
Back in the day, the yard was oh so filled
Now nobody comes around here

Out here in this world, (mind oh mind oh mind) just tryna make it (mind oh mind)
Everything I see (mind oh mind oh mind), sometimes I can't take it (mind oh mind)
But damn I really miss those times (mind oh mind oh mind)
(Mind oh mind) That soul food's on my mind (mind oh mind oh mind)
Mind, mind, mind

(Never thought it'd be, no soul food on my plate
We gather 'round and lie, bow our heads and pray and I)
I still remember, the family parties
The happy faces, no broken hearts
Nobody starvin', but all that there is old news
What happened to the soul food?

Out here in this world, (mind oh mind oh mind) just tryna make it (mind oh mind)
Everything I see (mind oh mind oh mind), sometimes I can't take it (mind oh mind)

You're so thorough, I want you in my world
You know I'm liable to spiral, no telling what I would do

You chauffeured over to the place that I've arrived to
You know I used to answer you, get it and go like a drive through
Until that day you said close you eyes let me ride you (let me ride you)
Drove me insane wit you're eye too
Nice move, maestro, you can queue the wedding march
I'm done, I tried to run but cupid hit me dead in heart
How ironic, arrows hit me you know I'ma sayin'

Raphael Saadiq,"Let me tell you about my day
It's such a very long day
It started around seven
And I can hear your breath

That's why I love Sunday mornings
Even when it's cold
There was always something burning
That was good for my soul

As I walk through the yard
I can feel you presence
You're giving me the time of my life
And (...) me the life lessons

Now I know what they mean
When they say keep your heads in the sky
And don't be too quick to fit in
And don't (...) I have to try

[Chorus]
This world is strange, so strange it is
You know it really hurts inside yeah (sometimes)
No matter how good you are to people you know
They'll make you cry sometimes (sometimes)

I'm so proud for you to see
The young man I came to be
With life long troubles
You kept a smile on my face

And as I'm looking all around me
A say how can I ever repay you
Mama was worth more than gold
And she always tried to tell me

[Chorus]

There's been a few days
When people truly let me down
I said (...) things
Just to bring me down

And they would (......)
Just for their self motives and greed
But I guess that ain't nothing new
It's just something I gotta go through

[Chorus]

Now how much more can I take before I shoot a kiss
Don't let them (...) for joke cause what you feel is very real yeah yeah

You know it makes me cry sometimes baby (sometimes)
Yes it does
Out of all the days and all the stories you've told me bout
You know I still hurt inside yeah (sometimes)

I go through life with my hands in the air
Said oh Lord help me there
Oh it hurts sometimes baby (sometimes)
Nobody can tell me better than you
About these things I will go through
Oh it hurts sometimes baby (sometimes)

Always asking questions 
But never getting really good answers
So I screamed out loud, 
I said please give up the answers
Give up the answers, they need the answers

Crawling out in a dark pretty city

It was scary, but life was good, see, in my neighborhood
In my neighborhood, in my neighborhood, in my neighborhood

It's all coming back to me now, see when I was growing up

See I'm trying to do my best, not to go to hell
I'm counting all my blessing, as I walk the narrow road,
Victory is near, that's what I've been told!

I can feel it getting closer, closer every day
I wanna be a warrior of everything I say
There's trials in the valley, take me upstream
I need to feel this water falling down over me
Falling down over me

I can see my name written across the sky,
Ravens started flying, I saw tears in their eyes
There was fires in the mountains and storms in the sea,
Winds in the valley, rushing into me.

Knock and it will open, seek and you'll be fine,
You're just a flower and the seed is your mind
Clouds will bring us water, and the Sun will bring us heat
But we have the power, moving from sea to sea
Moving from sea to sea

Let love bring us to-gether,
Let love bring us to-gether,
Let it bring us, let it bring us together!

Raphy Leavitt,"Saliendo yo de ti, me conseguí
Lo que sencillamente es toda una mujer
Con ella ha sido fácil compartir
Lo que contigo ya intente y no pudo ser

Es un amor que me llena de ternura y dulzura sin fin
Sin interés a lo que pueda darle yo
Bien sabes tú que no te puedes comparar
A esa sencilla mujer que hoy me hace feliz

Y es que yo en ti nada especial pude encontrar
Sólo fuiste una más, no puedo ya mentir
Saliendo yo de ti me conseguí
Otro nuevo querer, con ella soy feliz

Siempre fuiste para mí sólo una más

Fuiste una de esas novelitas de amor
Que engañan a lector con tono de poco valor
Y pensar y pensar que traté de inventar
Algo bonito contigo, pero todo fracasó

Y es que tú, por no saber del amor, lloras
Y es que no quieres bregar y sola te vas a quedar
Brincas y saltas como rana
Mas cuando caigas en la charca ya no sabré de ti

Tengo derecho a algo mejor
Tú te entregaste a la pasión sin condición
Avanza y coge el vuelo cara, [unverified]
Te toman por chavito prieto
Tu misma no te das valor lo digo yo

Dime para qué, dime para qué
Voy a luchar por una mujer, que sólo viene por interés
Sabes que  nadie escarmienta
Por cabeza ajena y me da pena, el que vuelvas a fallar

En el álbum del olvido te archivé
Una página olvidada eso serás
Tan solo ha sido un juguete
Pero ya el juego terminó, recoge y vete

For your tape or compact disc
I'm no man when I'm off the indo
With a proper tempo and an instrumental
I get so sick my homies know this
So kick on back because a player wrote this
Type a rap you know the beat is phat
And when I leave the party homies said you did that
It's a bay thing an everyday thing
You do your thing and I'll do my thing
I take the mic I like to rip it up
And if you call my bluff I'm like ""Nigga what?""
I am the rapper, 4-Tay
Don't crowd me fool because your in my way
I gotta run you over, hit the gas
Buck in the next lane on that ass
I bet you never thought I had the capability
It's ninety-foe and I know that you feel me
Fools are comin way too ill-iac
But a gang a the fools is comin way too whack
I'm a drop another one for ninety-five

Fresh out the lab a little dab

It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

For 1994, Tay is in this muthafucka
An' I could never be a silly stupid ass sucka
Busta, it runs in the family
Shakin' 'em, breakin' em, takin' em like a vet from the bay, G

Seff the Gaffla that's my nigga were persuin' this
Giggalo, giggalo G, boy you're doin' this, beat
So let me kick a verse about that shit called chronic
Don't try to play it stupid 'cause I know you up on it

You probably just rolled you one, probably just smoked you one
Callin' up the hooker play the ho for another one
Late night hustlin' in the projects, O.C.
My brothers in the dark an' were way past OD
Just flipped my money, feelin' good and I'm cheesin'
Seff'll hook you up or put you up on the season

It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four

Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

Rappin' 4-Tay, what's up with these foo's
Actin' like ho's when these niggas know the rules
So I'm about to flow, an' let these niggas know
About the why, the be, the G, it ain't easy being me, so

Break down the dank, roll it up with the quickness
Pass me a lighter so I can cure my sickness
How many hits does it take to make you stop?
How many tapes does it take to make you pop?

Go ahead an' tell me 'cause I really wanna know
Smokin' ind-e-o with my nigga Rappin' 4
Never beat around the bush I'm gettin' straight to the point
After every meal I fire up a dank joint

Gettin' high as a bird, a bald head eagle
Man I can't wait until they make dank legal
That'll be the day that'll probably be the end
Loungin' in the Mo smokin' dank drinkin' gin

Kinda like a rocker but I live in the ghetto
I got you hangin' on so you better not let go
Have a seat, what cha see, dank in your cup
Gain your composure while a nigga fire up

I smoke dank daily to the point that I'm lazy
Every day I smoke a half a quarter, can't faze me
You know who I am, so go ahead and jam
Fire up the dank while you let the tape slam, damn

I feel hella good for some reason
Got a nigga cheesin'
Indo's in season
Humboldt-Kelly all the way to the bay
Ragtop Productions with my homie Frankie J

Hooked a nigga up when he heard a nigga flow
Anotha platinum hit with the nigga Rappin' 4
And oh, you didn't know, I coulda told ya
You ain't got five on the dank that I hold ya
Ran out of Zags, get some more from the corner store

It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

Break a, break a twenty sack down to two joints
And fuck all that other shit niggas gettin' to the point
Pass me a baggie so I can empty the sack
I feel the bass in the back, if you can hang get the contact

'Cause niggas twistin' more than just your average dank smoker
Me an' my homies we blaze this shit we gets ova
An everyday routine if you fakin' with your paper
Call up my nigga 'cause he clockin' on this pager

Sticky, sticky green, oh no, I can't fade the brown leaf
Nothin' does it better than that potent ass indo weed
Keepin' my composure plus this douja's got me coughin'

And if one of these niggas don't pass the blunt I might go off
An' snatch it up an' smash it up an' puff it till it's outta there
You say you spent twenty dollars but ask me if I care
Now I got the munchies, need some cookin' from my boo
But she's out with her potters they in the cut smokin' dank too

Seems that everybody's smokin' plenty marijuana
But don't let that be the reason you're caught up in some drama
From slippin' and trippin' this lip until you're stuck
Sucka Free City niggas know what's up, what's up

Giggalo what's up G?

You know I'm still just chokin' smokin' same old thing
Ain't nothing changed

Yeah, I'ma send this one out to all the dank smokers out there
It's all good baby boy

And you don't run a motherfuckin' thang in here
So shut the fuck up and keep your eyes facin' the wall
My name is Lt. I Don't Give A Fuck
Now stretch

I just got of the grey goose
Hear at San Quentin Westblock, I hear they be gettin' loose
So allow me to scope the scene out
And find my folks, relatives, real playaz, I know they turnin' it out
Slangin' them thangs, police pop and now wit a glock
I'm lookin' for that buster, that truster who be callin' them shots
Cause he's the same sucker who got my folks stuck
Fool, he didn't give a fuck, so why should I give a fuck?
Revenge is a motherfucker, Imma be that sucker ducker
Creepin' wit my until blade you feel that mother
All up in your testikels I turn you in to a vegetable
Dissect that ass, yeah something extra-terrestrial
Cause it's a different ballgame behind these walls
And if ya soft than all the niggas gone get them drawz
And take ya manhood, you can't have it back silly rabbit
Now you gone call up your bitch 
And tell her they turned you into a faggot

Chorus:
Ya best ta think twice, cause it ain't nathen nice
What you want to do, one of them foolz wit 25-2-Life
And if ya never did time before
That means you keep it legit, makin' it smooth
Handlin' business, stay on your toes

Man, they got me in this orange jumpsuit
I'm goin' crazy as hell, live in a cell, sippin' cup of noodle soup
I know they think a nigga's gone insane
Because I stood at this funny style motherfucker ...
He was out to get me first, I just happened to get him quicker
A victim of circumstances, plus my blade was much thicker
You want to be gangsters behind these walls it's so much drama
I done seen the hardest nigga switch up and call home to momma
There's really no guarantee you make it to society
So all you perpetrator gonna find out what you want to be
Just a few words, some game plus a little advice
I got from my O.G. in the pen servin' the 25-2-Life
 
Chorus

I hear you claim to be the hardest induvidual
Can't nobody fade you, your mentality is more like criminal
Whenever there's drama or funk they say you handle the static
Yeah, you tha man, you and that fully automatic
Stepped up and swept up every turf wit disagreements
And every bitch that havin' a bowl of some of that ...
But ain't it a shame you can only travel across the streets to the store
They don't even trust you and that mother cause you robbed it before
Got you a sack of that yack and snored it, and snored it up
Than robbed another nigga the cut cause you didn't give a fuck
Everybody is blessed wit tha devil, he be a motherfucker
Get him off your back, get 'em off yo back before you kill your brother
On some of that kokane shit gets crazy I done seen it
Waked up the next day talkin' bout man I really didn't mean it
Lost all your love and all your trust, somebody is fuckin' your wife
You shot that nigga, that's why you servin' 25-2-Life

I understand that Four, but a lot of people don't know
what you've done been through bro'
Man, a brother done been in this rap game for ten years, man
I've been from hell and back, you know Frank
But what's gon' have to do 
is lay it down and lace it up like a shoestring
Ok, like this here...

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Allow me to take you back down memory lane
When a player was so young in this rap game
Yeah, if you had a fight you best to knock a sucker out
Because moms wouldn't about to let you in the house
Yeah, we had to throw em' in the days
Didn't have glock, never seen a twelve gauge
Wasn't no banging n' gang affiliated deaths
Brother had to go to school in the days to get a rep
Always wanted to bust a gang of these raps
And be the first player to put Frisco on the map
So add this to the list of them hits that be knockin for the new year
I'ma vet in this rappin industry, you wet behind the ear
Shit, I even caught the San Quinton blues
Used to rock that motherfucker every night, I paid my dues

Chorus:

I talked the talk, but now I'm walking the walk
What up, fool! Huh yeah! Yeah! What,what!

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
I'm from the west but I don't ride the saddle
Used to do a lot of battle, 
but you money are make your trunk rattle
Ever since the solar system, boys clubbing house parties
Rap contests at Booker T'S, man it was everybody
snatching it taking it swoop on stuff all the way home
Once me and O' hit the jets, man we was gone
Up the stairs to the vacabt house, that's we're we prctice at
We didn't have a studio so man we had to work with that
No reel to reels, no mic, just the radio
Paper and oen and I was in, the heart of the ghetto
Trying to pursue my dream, trying to make things right
I posted up at other people's shows begging to get the mic
I was kicking down doors, posted up, like the 49ers 
All I wanted to do was bust a rap before the headliners
They pushed me to the left, I said alright, that's cool
Now you call my booking agent, everyday, I paid my dues

Chorus:

I talked the talk, but now I'm walking the walk
What up, fool! Huh yeah! Yeah! What,what! 

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
The difference is you're talking about the game you see I'm living in
And all my folks R.I.P, I'LL see you in a minute
Before I cut I gots to shock it cause I'm still pissed
For my mistakes, court dates and the time I missed
A lot of deputies in correctional facilities
I kept they ass up all night, but now they feelin me
From bangin on the walls and bustin raps off the top ten
Bet you never though I be the entertainer of the year
But why not, cause I've got, what it takes to represent
Crowd could be a hundred thousand, I'm never hesitant
Just ask Franky J. to drop me an old school beat
Them funky instrumentals kept me of the streets
They kept me motivated, I was always underrated
I bet my real folks wasn't surprised when I made it
Plus I gave them digits back to the parole board
So now I'm cool, I'd been paid my dues

Chorus:

I talked the talk, but now I'm walking the walk
What up, fool! Huh yeah! Yeah! What,what!",I Paid My Dues

Rappin' 4-Tay,"I wonder why there's so much hatred in this world today
You know a lotta of us brothers and sisters 
Ain't gone make it to see another day
At the age of 12 I was on another page
I wanted to jug upon tha other people were gettin' their pay
My momma would always tell me about the direction that I was heading
Like the majority of these kids today, man I was hard headed
I wanted to know to much a little man is shookin' police
Imagine a juvenile delinquent waitin' for a release date
Wait, it's easy for me to blame it on my surroundings
My folks raised me right, I just wanted to be the first fool pounding
Up and down tha block, Fleetwood Caddilac
But take it from me, young G, because that lifestyle ain't all that
Unless you ready to strap ya gat and serve tha yak and jug the sack
To get ya bread back, playa, I'm up on all that
Cause being broke ain't no joke, boost up ya confidence
There's two options:legal or illegal, you know the consequenses

Chorus:
Stay strong through all this drama, cause there's a remedy
This world is so corrupt, jealousy and envy
To all my folks in tha pen I'm sending this to you, ya know
Hope you get to hear my rap, try to make it off parole

The streets are full of sadness, dope and geto madness
Besides your brain and slangin' them thangs the only apparatus
Be that hot lead, I seen him yesterday but now my homie's dead
I hope I ain't going crazy, I know I ain't losing my head
No more obituaries, no more hearse, that shit hurt
You damn right, but see there's game plus a part of life
Got so much game to give they label my rap positive
Why not take advantage of that and give it back to my neighbourhood
Because them people wit them badges callin' themselves police
Be them same suckers going home selling hella weed
Everybody's human we need to live by the constitution
I ain't no dummy, behind them walls of congress someone's juicin'
How you think the streets get flooded wit guns and knives and crack
Us blacks ain't got the type of machinery to deliver that
And the people that do kick back in mansions, pushing remotes
I ain't no hater, but man the law can't stand them folks

Chorus

Once that crack hit this world a lot of us lost our minds
Foolz was selling everything in tha house down to the iron
After Scarface I wanted to be like Tony Montana
Until the narcs caught me slippin' on tha ...
They followed me and sweated me as if I was a rich man
I'm just a playa up out of Frisco tryin' to put my mack hand down
I be around just like tha single
Twinkle twinkle who's tha star, how I wonder where you are
Stepped in tha back then test tha mic and break 'em off a proper ...
That's what I did for representing Cali, you know
I used to be local but now I'm a nation wide professional
Once I get home to tha Bay, six days are so boring
Down to call for my P.O. she wants to test my urine
Now I'm tryin' to think did I drink or did I smoke too much
Here I am in her office, I forgot to hide these bucks
Livin' beyond your means you know that's a violation, bro
Peace to all my homies across the world, stay off parole

Uh, (you tell me)

[Chorus: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]
[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Holler at a player though
40 Water, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

[E-40]
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Rappin' 4-Tay]
I keeps my distance from haters cause I'm quick to flash
Area takes me with a passion, I tap that ass
Be quick to blast, the game just ain't the same no more
You doing too much, pump your brakes, slow your roll
Fucking up the hustle with the streets and shit
It's too much legal tender on my agenda to bite our fame
But if you play me, I gots no choice to reach you in check
They playing with a full deck, you can get the breakfast, say thanks

[Verse 2: E-40]
See I'm a business man with a set of big balls
Marketing meetings and, uh, got Frisco
Just ain't your work for a living (uh huh)
They got hit, what the fuck?, you think I been got shit?, it ain't easy
Everyday now walk through the streets
A nigga can't even sit down with his family
And be straight and have a decent dinner
Without a motherfucker yelling, ""Refalations""
""What I got to do to get you in my compilations?"" (compilations)
So I study what I do, the shit for you for free (for free)
I used to do that to a nigga when I was seventeen (uh, uh)

[Chorus: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]
[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
What's the world coming to when niggaz talk down for fun
Some Rappin' 4-Tay you don't make me dumb
Pop a cherry, we don't mean that much
Cause if it don't make dollars I don't really give a fuck
Jocking all up under my name but you don't even know me
Got me fucked up and one of them suckers when they so called homies
If that's the shit, better pause and magnum or Crip, they ready to paint us
When niggaz go against the great 40 Water, what's wrong with the game?

[Verse 4: E-40]
I'm ten years hung in this shit, if I was up to heart
My nigga got dick, her is his, by selling chicks in front of his car
Got a crib with 9,000 square, Christine and Marsha, will you just imagine?
Big ass improving for Maximus, big ass, let's fetch it
I seen it in my dream when I was nine years old
My Momma always told me to achieve my goal
Keep a cool bid and, uh, respect a dollar
Never get too greedy for the money and power

[Chorus: E-40, Rappin' 4-Tay]
[Verse 5: E-40]
The reason I carry glocks, 26 on my side of my hip
Cause I ain't dumping now (dumping now), thinking of now a days
They act like you owe something (something)
Talking about, ""40, show me some love!, (show me some love!)""
Because I got a, a despot I'm my blood
Niggaz want to knock ME
Cause I don't blossom like a sunflower SEED
Surrounded by promises, you said that you keeps me smoking big WEED
Drinking while sipping Ale (sipping Ale) yes INDEED
Born and raised in Vallejo (eeehhhh!)

[Verse 6: Rappin' 4-Tay]
They claim they got solid rockets
So all my true player partners, why'all just stay focused
And watch them haters cause they plots on a daily basis
Hustlers, servants, traders that caught so many dope cases
And but I want the quickness if the G's is right
If that game was tight, ballers had pimped at it, ain't no such thing as
three strikes
No sense, our fucking minds aren't, but I'm on parole and shit
Niggaz get to running off at the mouth just like a snitch, some like a bitch
Ehhh!, Ehhh!

[Chorus: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]
[Chorus: E-40, Rappin' 4-Tay]
[Outro: E-40]
What's wrong wit the game?
Can't get caught off with the game
Just get my chips and get paid
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
Holler at a player though
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
Huh?",What's Wrong Wit the Game
Rappin' 4-Tay,"When you make the Kool-Aid
You put your own amount of sugar in it
Sweet, sweet love to your taste
To your own specifications
Now tell Kool-Aid, how much you want
How much can you flaunt (Tell em' bitch)
One scoop or two (Yeah)
Sweet, sweet love
When your rolling down the street (Errr!)
On them twenty inches and you ask her how much she want
(How much you want bitch) And you got a beat that goes with it

Sweet, sweet love
And she says I want it all
And you know it's cool-Aid in her tank
And your fixing to ride the stripes away
To sweet, sweet love
Take that thong off (Take it off)
And let me touch your thighs (Touch the pussy)
While we roll, I promise to keep my eyes on the road
While I'm touching that sweet, sweet love
To your specifications, to your gratifications
Yeah Kool-Aid is like an aphrodisiac
Your pleasure is mine
Like when a whore goes out to whore
And bring you back all the money
That's sweet, sweet love
Don't try it and even put some strychnine 
Listen to the pronunciation of strychnine in this cool-Aid
This ain't no Jim Jones thing
This is just sweet, sweet, love

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I met her back in the day
Knew how much the bitch weighed and payed
It was sort of like a masquerade
Fake suede boots and Cadillac coupes swoop the boulevard (Err!)
In hot pursuit and we ain't afraid to shoot
From hotel to motel, for the highest clientele
You and you, I give a fuck how the pussy smell
Heads to tails, the bitch bail with limp
With a hell of a limp, see on that gangsta tip
See-notes, fifties and tens we cashed in
Bought a brand new Benz on gold Lorenzos rims
Anything I want my bitch gon' go out and get it
Hustle round and swear that a real pimp is his business
Who got the floss and ball to rise and fall
If a bitch want to do it she gon' fuck em' all
Dog, dog what up, Kool-Aid pimpin' keep on dippin'
Sippin' yac with a yamp, puttin' hoes on they back
It's like that

Everyone want to know how a pimp can do his thing
 
Ridin' sly, gettin' high
Bitches on the corner sellin' pussy tonight hey!
Everyone want to know how a pimp can do his thing
Ridin' sly, gettin' high
Got plenty of my bitches sellin' pussy tonight hey!

Tapped in with this baller I met, pushin' the Vette
He moved to California said he ain't got searched yet
Ah, she gon' blow ya socks off
And peal them rocks off
Bring em' home to daddy, so saddy
Pimp in the Caddy
Keep my hand on the gun
Cause they got me on the run
Menage trois in the telly
Anaconda all in the belly
She gon' serve four tricks
And suck some more dick
Homie this a bad bitch
Better than average
King Bing, Don Bishop, and White tie Gotti
Feel more slim than the Max to skip and dump the body
P-i-m-p, young G's, O.G.s

Fleetwood bronze, mobile phones and O-Zs nigga
Daz Dillinger feelin' ya every time you bust
Playa discussion, 'Kuruption' just like Kurupt
Fifty toes on the corner, block hatin' is irrelevant
They sellin' it, motherfucker are inhalin' this
Here pimpin'


Me and my homies we pimp the same ho
Pimp the same ho, ridin' through slow
Blaze through third and first and do what ya do
I done, done I done, done
Pull up and wrap the shotgun
They know me Gotti, she know we pimpin' and never slippin'
I pimp hoes on the side, side
Side, ride, slide provide applied
Upped the supplied supply
Swats, I gave it my own try
Improvise, be saddled up pimpin' hoes worldwide
Smack the bitch, smack the bitch
Take the bitch money, money
That's my grip the bitch get
Shakin' that lil' limp skinny ass body the bitch got
Turnin' the Gotti on the cock
And make the bitch hit the block, I'm tired of these hoes
Now a days fallin' crawlin' ah bitch come on
Bitches reconcile, ball and gobble and gargle
And swallow and her name was Tina

Get off in the zone then I'm in and blaze up
You ain't about your cheese I'd advise you to raise up
Cowards can't kick it cause the game don't mix right

Players, gangsters, hustlers, you motherfuckers in trouble
Critically acclaimed, this men is his nemesis, ain't no end to this

Fish tailing, inhaling, bailing, positive suspension
Don't hate on a player cause I'm staying on a mission

I keep it sparking, heat is barking, daylight to darkness
Known for doing wrong, getting ours regardless
We come up out the ghetto, never settle for chump change
We out there running things doing our thug thing
Game recognize and I been checking mine
Gang of suckers try, get them lame second tries
We G'd up, see'd up sipping, blazing weed up
Haters steady playing but ain't ready yet to see us
We bust big caps, restless with your chit-chat
Player, where your chips at?, broke?, you better fix that
If you ain't a hustler you must of been a buster
It's all about who falling out the game and who running
Done it all like a hog calling the dogs
Never sleep, never slip and not often I pause

And make everybody in the party throw it up

To rebirth a nation, water distilled
So, when she break water spill, catch the flow like Jacqueline
Onassis, the curse and the gift
Canibus, take notes to you niggas that’s battling, nigga
Whats beef? Cattle and javelin
That shit ain't real nowadays, niggas just actin’ it
Zulu the real, the nation I rep
Keep medallions round my neck like the belt post accident
Kanye West, walk with Jesus my way
How you really all should pray if you knew what was happening
Yo, forget the name, they never can do
Twenty years still touched cuz the flow so passionate
Like prayers up to Jehovah when traveling
Protect me from rap foes and all the fake rap men
Believe me they souls is paper thin, for paper when
Heart ain't gold, I dont find you rich like Solomon
Rap three times nice like the number of wise men
Frontin’ niggas juke 'em every day like Heisman

Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies

Said you weren’t doin’ well and I ain’t well neither

Don’t know what we doin’, every day it feels hopeless
I know we both in love but I dunno if love’ll hold us
Baby I wanna, contemplatin’ with Jehova
Praying if I do that I can trust that we can lay on sofas
And just talk about it
I don’t wanna argue, I don’t wanna cry about it
I guess I’m comin’ home to you
It’s been too long, and like you, I can’t do without it
It hurts, I can’t breathe well at all
That’s real love when you can’t exhale tomorrow
Won’t be pleasant, it’s dark even if the sun shines
My mind too cloudy they can hear my cries through the walls, neighbors
See the morning papers at my door, him through my vent praying for my sores
Not livin’ well cause hell I miss you like Williams, Venus
Inner space I pray to God, every day I’m dreamin’
God, save me, I need my baby back
Goin’ crazy like Shady, this is proof of that
Can’t breathe, don’t really need no noose for that
Hangin’ myself throwin' this liquor back, off a track
We all go through rocky roads and we both react
I got your call and I called to say I’m comin’ back

I feel like the weight of the world here
I can’t protect you from it like I used to do past years
So, I leave it all in God’s hands and pray like the pastors
I know the world tough, wish I could hide it like cashmere
Wool over your eyes, though we hunger like fast here
For truth, in your youth your only problem was mad beer
Now the glass empty and you fill it mad tears
Cause peace don't come cheap when you paying like cab fare
Yea, and, war is a beast right?
Looking at the stars like we used to do all night
And, I'm praying on 'em all hoping that you are alright
Thinking of the days we used to chill and drink tall sprites
Life was simple, just work and pay bills off
Now you far away fighting, feeling like Bill Maher
These real times, tryna understand what you kill for
How it feel heavy like the weight of steel door
And, still I open up and share with you heavy hearts
Praying for my brother in Afghanistan fighting war
Against brothers that you’d probably mistake him for
It feel like we all need to love and pray more

We all know somebody that remind us like Trayvon
My mind used to tell me “girls we gotta just pray for 'em
Cause hate ain't born in you, it's just something they raised on”
Shoot 'til the fade gone and practice decease
We gotta fight cause we can overcome and we don't compete
I got the gift of gab like Gab Douglas, just gotta reach out
The bars are in my hand, they can't stand like the beach house
The flow, I finally see now
The ones that hate the most just want to be where we be now
Another day running to makeup like the sad clown
Reverse roles they use to hold all of us all down
Yo, it came to me like Dan Brown
Da Vinci code, we all seeking truth they don't want us to know
Yo, like what we really all fighting fo’?
It you ask me yall we all need to just pray mo’
For friends, family, and our sanity mostly

Er ist ihr Aufpasser, Zuhälter, so'n Ledernacken, 
Goldketten tragender Glatzkopf, so'n richtiges Arschloch 
begrüßt sie mit Küsschen und hebt sie am Arsch hoch 
Sie gibt ihm 'ne Schelle und steigt ins Auto ein 
Er ihr hinterher und man hört nur noch Geschrei 
Der Wagen fährt los, direkt ins Hauptbahnhofsviertel 
Bevor sie arbeiten geht, drückt sie sich das Zaubermittel 
Das ihren Kopf freimacht und ihren Körper schmerzfrei 
Es klopft an der Tür und der erste kommt rein.

Doch jeder Tag für sie eigentlich 'ne Qual ist 
Doch keiner weiß es, weil sie es verheimlicht 
Die Mutter ist schon tot, der Vater arbeitslos 
Er lebt in Alk, zieht Koks 
Sie geht nicht gern nach Haus, denn er zieht sie nachts aus 
Und sagt „Das träumst du bloß“ 
Sie ist verwirrt und will nur, dass es endet 
Schließt ihre Augen und wartet bis er geht 
Er sagt zum Schluss noch 
»Sag es keinem, denn wenn du's sagst, schick ich dich ins Heim«
Sie fängt an zu weinen und sagt nur 
»Mama, wieso lässt du mich hier so allein«
»Ich will jetzt bei dir sein, Gott schenk mir Flügel«
»Denn wenn es Gott gibt, hat er auch Gefühle.«

Es ist jeden Tag dasselbe für sie. Sie wollt' es nie so 
wie ihre Mutter sein, zu Haus allein, schläft jeden Abend unter Tränen ein 
Wächst ohne Vater auf und im Haus der große Bruder 
keine Liebe von der Mutter, schimpft sie Schlampe und Luder 
Eigentlich ist sie wirklich sweet, wenn man sie lächeln sieht 
Weil sie das Weggehen liebt, kam es vor, dass sie bis spät nachts in den Clubs blieb 
Nur auf der Suche nach Liebe, Geborgenheit und Verständnis 
Lernt sie 'nen Typen kennen – die Liebe zu ihm wächst bis unendlich 
Die Erkenntnis viel zu spät, als sie`s nach 2 Wochen erblickt 
dass während sie zu Hause bleiben muss, er ihre beste Freundin fickt
Alles andere als Glück für die kleine Frau mit großem Traum 
Auswandern, Familie, Haus bauen, Liebe und Vertrauen 
Manchmal entspannt sie sich und lächelt, wenn sie im Solarium bräunt 
Als Belohnung für gutes Aussehen gibt's zuhause Schläge vom Freund 
Das letzte was man von ihr fand,es war ein Satz im Tagebuch 
»Gott, meine Flügel sind gebrochen, bitte erlöse mich von dem Fluch!«",Gott Schenk Ihr Fl端gel

Ich sag „Kann sein, ich heiß Steve und wir hatten grad ne Show“.
„Wie siehts aus, hast du Lust noch ein bisschen zu tanzen?“
Mit ‚nem bisschen Glück kann ich mit dem Spruch bei ihr landen.

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light

Search for a light

Unchain my hands
Now I've got my freedom

Highways I've roamed 
Looking for the distant faces
Gold on the border
And silver in my hands

Meantime I stay
Alone and never changing
And if I did
No one got in my way

Unchain my hands

It goes down
I thought you knew it went down

Verse One:

I rock Versacci, sippin VSOP and Hennessey in foam cups
Motorola flips with illegal chips
Dip-pin' like Teela where everybody momma collectin money from fiend
Five series Beemer, one-hundred and eighty-nine horsepower
I like bitched with dimples and nipples the size of silver dollars
Rollin three deep in Eddie Bauers chokin out LAPD Rottweilers
like chihuahuas, all day eryday
In Southern California where the dogs and the ribs stay
And nowadays fools don't know how to act
Cause we all want to be Tony Montana
Matter of fact, gimme five we got dap, gimme twenty-five
We got a bird and profit is made
So while the homey cut cavvy with a razor blade
I rock beats without baking soda
And money gets watched it's only illegal if you get caught
Thought you knew cause the DEA do it too
Keep separate books for the internal revenue
Capitalism is pimps and hoes
In ninety-six I 'spose anything goes

Chorus:

Big bank take little bank       anything goes
Legal or illegal                however you make your cash flow
Big bank take little bank       ahh anything goes
Legal or illegal                however you make your cash flow

Verse Two:

All you PH Ballers, Dirty Mack's need to KG
I'd rather be a dope MC than a broke OG
I get, manicures to keep my cuticle suitable
Player, don't hate me because I'm beautiful
I got a pocket full of see-notes and food stamps
Just big bills and free meals baby so lamp
Cause jealousy gets you burned like bad perms
if you live you learn, I spit game like Chick Hearns
to women with, measurements of 38-24-36 with DSL's
but money talks ESL
In the game of Monopoly, if you don't pass go then go di-rectly to jail
Cause I've seen fools that struggle and turn they ownself into the po-po
It keeps the humble of they cool low
Selling ten dollar J's right up under the man's nose
Hahh, nigga anything goes

Verse Three:

Niggaz got stripes like, Tony the Tiger
But niggaz got strikes like Oral Hershiser
So look alive, inflation rise like yeast
S&L scandal stole millions
But we need more police to take back our streets, it's drama
We all know that one-time be extortin them big-ballers
Gettin extradited with warrants in three states
Overcrowded prisons hopin the DA drop the case
So uhh, I ain't forgot about the homey Kevin
He pled no contest and got stretched til ninety-seven
Dizmost and Little Dags hold tight
I know I seldom shoot kites but I be tryin to get my pockets right
My ideal real is Big Willie pourin out Dom P
for the dead homies with bitches splittin Phillies (call it ends)
Call it loot scrilla cream green flow or dough

Now you claim I'm runnin' game and still let us run the train 
Pulling Coolio's braids  it wasn't me  it was the fame 
Let a dame complain about disrespecting my African queen 
Ass hangin' out them Daisy Dukes jeans, jockin'
Damn I love civilization 
Wants to know my occupation home location and means of transportation 
The correct combination unlocked your placenta 
I got a cellular phone with a rubber antenna 
On a three story house, drive a four door Ac 
Favorite song of all time Mobb Deep's ""Hit It From the Back"" 
Then jet, I turn a bitch into my favorite 
She know my name cause I got more game than Sega CD 

[Chorus]
You know it's drama, but it sound real good (3X) 
You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back 
You know it's drama, but it sound real good (3X) 
You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back 

I try U.N.I.T.Y. but why? 
Cause when I was lackin', bitches made me want to roll over and die 
So now I lie, cause bitches are like flies {why?} 
They attract to the best shit {oh!} 
You gotta play Max Julian's role unless you plan on being celibate 
Cause bitches want the money clip and whatever dick that comes with it 
{The bitch} saw me in the Lex and didn't know it came from Avis 
Now she's on the Tip like my name was John Davis 
And I'm knowin' what she thinks {what?} 
I'm a sweep her off her feet because I bought the hoe a drink 
Bitch, ha ha yeah I'm living nice, got a two o'clock flight to Atlanta 
{Tomorrow} so maybe we can kick it {tonight} 
Right there I knew my dick was getting wetted 
Cause I played into this bitch's Cinderella complex 
Whatever you want to hear, I can say 
Forget the bitch the next day, instant replay 

[Chorus]

Yo Ras, let me talk about these bitches for a minute 
But let's get it straight, when I say the word bitch 
I don't mean all women 
Cause hookers come a dime a dozen if you thought they wasn't 
You can hit this hoe today, and tomorrow you can hit her cousin 
Or her mama, you gots to have drama 
Nigga flash some currency and go up in her auntie! 
I'm talkin' bout the skinless type loc 
You know the type that seem to like the taste of swipe 
Check it 
When it comes to Saving Hoes Coolio ain't in it 
Don't call me Captain, general, sergeant, or lieutenant 
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
I gave the bitch my autograph, and she gave me some ass 
But as soon as the hoe tried to get in my pocket 
I shot her ass away from me schch like a skyrocket 
Take it from a G, period, no comma, to keep these hookers 
On they toes, you know the rest

Ras Kass,"Chorus: (sampled from Black Moon's ""How Many MC's Must Get Dissed"")

Pen predator
Pen predator, et cetera et cetera (7X)
Pen predator, et cetera, yeah right

1st Pull:
Niggaz know it's about that time without a Schoolly D Gucci
I pop that pussy ass rapper and leave it up to Luke to Pop the Coochie
Truly a wretched steelo -- kept you Under siege like Seagal
Cause I housed more niggaz than that faggot named RuPaul
y'all all suffer the consequences
I dispense dope sentences without a prescription
prefixes asphyxiate bitches who flips linguistics
Representin the West, relevant to relentless sentences
If renegade rebels resent this wicked syntax (then jack)
Revert to revolution Ras reverse, reverberates
Revolvin with written retalliation, rate repetitious
Reflex flex, regret niggaz regress to less than recoup
When recording, I wreck, records
Reflect stupid, it's so much more than just another rap and sample
Cause I model more styles than Naomi Campbell
See we been burning idiots with lyrical syphillis
Since E.S.T. was Ackniculous, the nickle slick meticulous
ventriloquist when I throws my voice over the Western HemisFear
While my peers step over a Trail of Tears
Go get a job as a chandelier wit a glass jaw like dat
I brings the impact to fracture mandibles, and manhandle the youth
Since my mental exceeds every MC I've perceive credible
Now becomes edible, kid!
And yo, I'm D for wreckin when reputations collide
But zhoom dumb da dumb, dadada dumb dumb
Suicide it's a suicide

(""Pen predator, et cetera, et cetera"") --> repeat 10X
(""Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right"")

2nd Pull:

I pull bitches like a lesbian and could come the fuck off
with a vasectomy, in depth I be deeper than Bosses' recipe
Incite recitation forever Ras Rock Steady like Buck when breakin on ducks
Who get props by association
Buy if ya lyrics suck, then fuck ya record label's juice
Ock, I rock hip-hop non-stop and got more juice than Snapple
Intricate to simplistic stylistics I solicit
It gets niggaz open like fallopian ovulation
Fuckin these kids like the Michael Jackson molestations
Sendin ya back as the U.S. Nation did AIDS infected refugee Haitians
Uhh, yeah niggaz so what's the haps
You could put up ya dukes but in the West they bust caps
So bulletproof fists is the only way I'm gone miss, but peep this
My mental's the bullet, my tongue's the finger that pull it
Check the method, soundtrack voodoo uh and bamboo like strapped
Come better you, oh sorry verbal dyslexic
You better come strapped like bamboo and a voodoo soundtrack
And make sure not even one bar sounds wack (bitch)
Cause we take the best shit and make it classic
Word to Guru, take two fuckin pulls, and pass it",Etc.
Ras Kass,"Hook:
We Could marinate, get nice and and stack riches
(But it's B.Y.O.B.) Bring your own bud, brew, and bitches
Ain't no set trippin', actin' ill and don't steal, for real
(You got's to chill)

Verse 1:
I woke up in my Tommy Hilfigures boxers at 10 from a knock at the door
But why they at my door for?
Oh! My peep's they got a half gallon, smilin' 
My talons totalled ten one empty round from putting it down
But now, my day is starting off Coca Cola and Remy Martin
Some of the homeys from L.A. and Carson want to throw a private party today
Threw on some Gautier and my Rolex link dressed to kill like Bernard Getts
My squad flex like Lee Haney, so its best I keeps myself on house arrest
Cause you never know, maybe they might wind up at 429 Bauchet 
Locked away, plus can't keep the boody calls waiting
I'm marinatin'

Hook

Dialed up some micehead to see what's crackin' tonight 
She said she just broke up with her man
And since she free like Mnadela, she bringina box of Philly pantellas
Acapells, I game like Lou Panella made sure to tell her 
Don't bring no fellas, cherral, girl you can braid the tweed 
And then you can show me how to do the pepper seed
Agreeded, cause we get down like this on a regular, loungin' 
Watchin' bootleged tapes, shooting jokes, your choice of imported smokes
Craps and Celo on the patio for more chips than Bingo
Chips like the MGM casino
Just make sure your homegirl is single, so it's popping
Cause ain't nothing worse than fifth wheels that's cockblocking
And knocking while I""m knocking talking about she ret' to go 
I want some of your brown sugar while I bump D'Angelo
(Fo'sho) No special holiday, but sometiems just being alive is a reason for
celebratin
So we mariniatin'

Hook (x2)

I get around like Dolby Pro Logic,
But running them streets too much get fools hated
Incarcerated, or terminated
At the house we safely intoxicated, Nonoxol-9 lubricated
Playing questions, everybodys faded and now, we got the ladies undressing
Like 1st King strippers bouncin' on nigggas balls like the LA Clippers
The phone rang, my little shorty said ""What you up to, boo?""
Nothing, just chillin' like bruh-man on Martin do
See only when I'm tipsy, when my words start slurring
Do I get causght telling lies like Mark Furhaman
So I'll call you later drink was low, went to the stash and pulled out the
XO
The T.U.'s is down for whatever
Let's run more trains than the metrorail but ya'll got to be out by two 
I'm getting sleepy and plus my boo is coming through
So let the front door hit you where are you Paul probably might
And everybody asking what's up for tomorrow night

Hook",Marinatin'
Ras Kass,"Hallelujah when I do ya

[Verse One]
Shit, I ain't never seen an angel, virgin bitches with halos
But my secular metaphysical theology is fatal
Because me with a mic cable is a religious experience in itself
I got a message from God
He said, ""Don't even try to fuck with me,"" suckered reluctantly
Carried the cross and uppercuts and at that, I'm hazardous
I speak to the heads and raise the dead like Lazarus
Led the fucking lambs to the slaughter, and walked on water
When it's frozen, in the ground influence and I'm on point
like the unicorn and you need a form, to bring rains
to Desert Storm for 40 days and 39 nights
So my cerebral flows flood the Earth with a, megahertz
And the first shall be last and the last shall be first
Reciting a biblical verse before I make your melon burst
Like that nigga Jules from Pulp Fiction
My salvation is salivation, indiction crucifixion
It's a blessing just to live another day they say
Because the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away
So my niggaz pray five times a day and still
carry a trey-five-seven (On Earth, As It Is In Heaven)

[Chorus]
(On the planet) Earth, it was my place of birth
Born to be the sole controller, of the universe
        Drinking with the Lord and shoot dice with Christ
Hitting seven, On Earth, As It Is In Heaven

[Verse Two]
Feeling like a cock, cause I be talking to a burning bush
But I'm not knowing till I fornicated with the hoe and
caught the claps so, my first communion consists of
bread and wine and dioxycill in one-hundred milligram capsules
Let the commandments begin again
Cause just like Moses on Mount Sinai, I broke all ten
For the believing, in the evening, when I covet my neighbors wife
I do dirt and get works to reap life, victimize
and give us this day to make our daily bread
Cause if I'm broke I'm serving cavvy in Bethlehem
Or selling my soul to Satan, six figure record deal
protection's my religious denomination, B.C.
I be the coming like when Mary's water broke
So let there be light, so niggaz can see I rock mics religiously
Those who believe ye shall receive
But non-believers, you niggaz doubt my existence like agnostics
The hostile gospel, I apostle, with epistles from speaking in tongues,
but God sewed up and gave his only begotten Son
to set it on niggaz, blowing backwards bastards to Kingdom Come
And knowing the Judas in my crew
So do unto others before they do unto you
Like Rastas heads be dreadin
Phoenetic armageddeon (On Earth, As It Is In Heaven)

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I hit the planet like a plague
The Book of Revelations red dragon with ten horns and seven heads
and seven crowns skills concealed until the Seventh Seal revealed
to fulfill prophecy
From B.C. to AC/DC radio receivers
The messiah comes back igniting the fever in the rap world game
(The hit after) The three headed raptor, is after
You hear the HemisFear trinity raps rap to you Babylon fires
Cause thou shalt not worship false idols
Just like David guillotined Philistines even God is homicidal
Fucking these kids like catholic priests after mass
Pubic hair of lamb's wool, and feet of burned brass
That I can put up in your platinum ass son
Instead I arrive the Golden Child, every knee shall bow
when the divine styler is speaking in parables
Like old baptist churches I'm getting old bitches hysterical
HALLELUJAH!  Praise be to my medula oblongota
I blew God and not another nigga hotter, believe that Meshach
The hip-hop martyr who sacrificed and gave my life
But got 4Pac, so I'm livin the Thug Life in the afterlife
Then I be walking through the pearly gates
with an infared scope ten millimeter heater
'cause if my name ain't in the Book of Life I'm snuffing St. Peter
Drinking the blood of Jesus Christ and pissing holy water
no QUESTION who can come cleaner
M-P-see plus M-I-see equals holy be	-I-be	-L-E to me
Matrimony is getting head but I refuse to break bread
with Jezebels, my management already gets twenty percent
so fuck tieing, go to Hell
I'd rather continue backsliding
You're not from the tribe of Judah, so why you lying?
Come watch the Zion, I'm signifying
the next shit to wreck shit and see the Exodus

[Chorus]",On Earth as It Is...

""Soul"" (echo)

Hook:
""Soul on ice"" 

Verse 1:
I was told two wrongs don't make a right
But three rights make a left
Act your age not your color 
But I'd rather act darker
Mark a page with mazes of labyrinth
Fuck up a rhyme so bad
I leave the microphone abstinent
To MC or not to MC?
Beyond B.E.T. and MTV exists me
Origin
Cause God created man and man created hip hop
I declined to participate until I was orientated
I heard 50,000 drivebys
And 49,999 was lies
No surprise, as the sun rises
Thine eyes have seen the light
But we stalk the night
I expose like an overbite
In limbo I lamp
Rape the lady kill the tramp
The wrong action for the motive
So now
Give me 50,000 black angry role models
Take me to DC I'll throw the first fuckin' bottle
Cause I don't give a fuck about a menial existence
And I don't give a fuck about nonviolent resistance
Civil right will not suffice
In the name of Jesus Christ they got my Soul On Ice

Hook

Verse 2:
Walkin' on skulls cause I'm two steps ahead
So I started at square three 
Now I'm Cubed like O'Shea Jackson be
Subzero catching fatalities to my spirituality
Smoke like a chimney, drink like a Kennedy
Still no remedy 
Fuck shooting a fair one
Cause open cuts from fuckin' some nigga up 
Can lead to contracting HIV positivity
You never know who got traits of femininity
What agwan, pussy wool blood clot 
And deal with the bullshit bodybot business faggot
You play the villain
There will be another soundbwoy killin'
Benadryl pumps through my adrenaline
Feelin' my raps weight 
I track Heavy like Tony Dofat
Hip hop is 2% milk but mostly no fat (phat)
And most MCs ain't prepared 
So what I say goes over your head like pubic hair
In 1999 (flip the script)
Triple six
One world government ""Novus Ordo Seclorum""
Check your dead president
Represented on the one dollar bill 
And if Clinton was the answer it was a stupid question

Gotta keep it crunk though
When the DJ pay, she next on stage
After the song she gotta go, meet you at bar when I'm done
1-51, tie cherries in a knot wit her tongue
Work the poll like Dominique Dawes, without drawers
Applause, brakin' niggas like laws
We fantasize for the chance to romance
But it cost 10 dollars for another lapdance

[Chorus]

[RC:]
I've been your fool, you know you gotta pay your dues
You want to get wit Ras and Rueb
Then you must choose, and you know you can't loose
There's somethin' bout the way that you shakin' your rump
It makes me feel good 'cause I likes to hump
The way you move your body in a sexy way
It makes want to lapdance everyday

[Ras Kass:]
She said 5 for the top, 10 for the bottom
Looked her up and down, said ""Hmm, I got 'em""

[RC:]
And she worked the nightshift
A dish water blonde, tall and fine
She made a lotta till, ask her what you gotta say, nigga

[Ras Kass:]
First of all, she 5'8"", I'm 5'6""
But if I put on my Prince heels, can we go on a dance
Had her laughin', like Ras you off the hook
I got 101 positions, that'll leave you shook
Off the books, I'm all yours on all fours
Wit nine chords, so, me and more
Keep it real wit me, pick me up at three
Scooped up in the Lex, and got served for free OohWee

[Chorus]",Lapdance
Ras Kass,"[Verse One]
Guess who's the man this winter, straight out the land of sinners
The Range is tan with spinners, check out the white mirrors
Blow with the damn winners while you and your man's finished
Two in your Rams fitteds, turn off your lightswitch
Holdin my torch down, even when the force 'round
You let your wife roam, she want a divorce now
You niggaz ain't this gully, play it I paint your skully
You never take this from me the riders and all the gangsters love me
You shouldn't be a problem, I ain't be a problem
See you later I'll red your head, you'll be a Rodman
I know your type, hoppin all over beat screamin
You call it hypin yourself up, I call it street dreamin
I do it for all the haters, the players roll with the gators
They lookin forward to favors, gossip is all they gave us
You niggaz wasn't quiet, meet the whales and the fishes
You leak the precinct up, play tattletale with the snitches
Even my momma knows, I got all kind of hoes
They wait outside of shows strict after the diner close
I'll get designer clothes, without the wine or rose
Take off my baby blue mink, and Carolina vogues
come here, take a look inside a entertainer's closet
I never trust a bitch, I blame Lorena Bobbitt
Niggaz stay in pocket, I know you're mad at me
But shit ain't all peaches and cream, and I ain't Sara Lee
Bitch!

[Chorus]
Don't ice me, you starin at the wrong one
It's a lot of girls here, go and get a grown one
We at the bar poppin bottles 'til they all gone
If you ain't leavin here with us, you can walk home
Cause someone else will, they know how we ride
If you a playboy, you got one on the Eastside
Keep your mouth closed, we don't let the beef ride

.. (what) right .. (what) right .. (what) right .. (right, damn!)
(Let's go)

[Verse Two]
I do this for the hood, niggaz stuck in the slammer
I smile cause I'm good, you act tough for the camera
Run from the lil' kids, they fuckin with Santa
Cause they like 2Pac more - word?  Word to my grandma
I figure I might as well leave here with my glock drawn
Cause they'll take to jail, even when you're not wrong
Dawg you're not this flashy, jux you got to blast me
Every rock is classy nobody on your block can match me
You shouldn't want a fight, unless you want to fight
for your life in the hospital a hundred nights
I know your type, run behind your girl rushin
You call it quality time, I call it handcuffin
I'm on a beach in Miami, so you ain't reachin my family
All weekend with panties from Puetro Rican Cammie
You niggaz wasn't tough, I shoulda snapped two flicks
You wore your pants tight, played pitty-pat with the chicks
Even my father knows, where the revolver goes
I bring the beef to your front door like dominoes
And my diamonds froze, that mean my time is froze
Me in the club from when it's poppin 'til the time it close
Half of these so-called real niggaz'll probably sing
Nah I ain't pullin over, learned that from Rodney King
So tell your homey chill, you know I hold the steel
Everything be jabs and hooks, and you ain't Holyfield
Nigga!

[Chorus]

Everybody on the left get yo' hands up
Everybody on the right get yo' hands up
Everybody up front get yo' hands up
And everybody out back get yo' hands up
And if you in here with a strap get yo' hands up
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
... man fuck what he said man, put 'em up!
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)

If everyday I saw sunshine and it never rained the blues
If my fear's with tears I wonder could they fall
If a smile could stretch a mile even if I had no money at all

But I'm willing to take whatever life brings
Cause you're the only one that seems to know me
And even if the bad times call

If I had you back I wouldn't complain at all
I wouldn't complain at all

I can dream about tomorrow even if it's still today
I'd wear down my knees every night even if I had no hands to pray
If my friends were dead and gone leaving me here alone
Could I depend on some spirit to ease me when my soul's on its own
If my eyes were blind and I couldn't feel at all to see
Nothing in this world but you complete me
And even if the bad times call

Lands on the face of a dream come true

And catch up on the front page morning news

Listen to the voice that warms my heart
I drag myself through a few more hours
Then head on home to try and beat the dark

I never though would end
Baby, I've been

Waiting all my life to find you
Always been one step behind you
Your love babe
I've been waiting all my life

I was tired of waiting
Every night was praying
Everyday would be the day I'd find you
I grew so impatient, how long would it take
To know you were out there somewhere
Somewhere waiting, wondering just like me

I've been waiting all my life to love you
All that time I was dreaming of you
Your love babe
I've been waiting all my life

And did I lose faith, did I lose heart
Maybe I did, but I never lost my way
To where you are - I've been

Waiting all my life to find you
Always been one step behind you
Your love babe
I've been waiting all my life

Rascal Flatts,"If I ever write the story of my life
Don't be surprised if you're where it begins
Girl, I'd have to dedicate every line on every page
To the memories we made, while you loved me

I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived, oh how I lived
(I lived) While you loved me

I'd start with chapter one, love innocent and young
As the morning sun on a new day
Even though I know the end, Well I'd do it all again
'Cause I got a lifetime in, while you loved me

I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me

Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it every time

Is knowing that forever you're all mine
The closer you get, the more my body aches

Baby, scream and shout
I want to sing it on the radio, show it on a video

I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud

You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt

Than it did in the old days 
So naturally, we have more natural disasters

And we can't slow down ?cause more is best

Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke 
Where everything is black and white 
Picking on a six string 
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name 
Watching the clouds roll by 
Bye, bye 

Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting 
Through the trees as the wind blows 
That's when I climb up here on this mountain 
To look through God's window 
Now I can't fly 
But I got two feet that get me high up here 
Above the noise and city streets

This morning I rolled out of bed
Recalling all the sweet things you said
This was the day I was gonna hurt you bad
Called out your name, but you

Top down makin' the rounds,
Checkin' out the bands on Dull Hinney Avenue.

But you learned to swerve.

And the next thing you know I'm reminiscing.
Dreaming old dreams,
Wishing old wishes,
Like we would be back again.

They fall down like rain.

I head off to my job,

You ran off to Vegas,
You married a rodeo cowboy...why

Me I've been a few places,
Mostly here and there once or twice.
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright.
Yea, It's good to see you too.

Well hey girl, you're late.
And those planes they don't wait.
But if you ever come back around
This sleepy old town,
Promise me you'll stop in

And then I did

Rascal Flatts,"I spent the morning at an old friend's grave
Flowers and Amazing Grace, he was a good man
He spent his whole life spinnin' his wheels
Never knowin' how the real thing feels
He never took a chance or took the time to dance
And I stood there thinking as I said goodbye
Today is the first day of the rest of my life

I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on
And learn how to face my fears
Love with all of my heart, make my mark
I want to leave something here

Go out on a ledge, with out any net
That's what I'm gonna be about
Yeah I want to be runnin'
When the sand runs out

'Cause people do it everyday
Promise themselves they're gonna change
I've been there, but I'm changin' from the inside out

That was then and this is now
I'm a new man, yeah, I'm a brand new man
And when they carve my stone they'll write these words
""Here lies a man who lived life for all that its worth""

I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on
Learn how to face my fears
Love with all of my heart, make my mark
I want to leave something here

Go out on a ledge, with out any net
That's what I'm gonna be about
Yeah I want to be runnin'
When the sand runs out

And as the cold wind blows
Across the graveyard
I think I hear the voice
Of my old friend
Whisper in my ear

Go out on a ledge, with out any net
That's what I'm gonna be about
Yeah I want to be runnin'
When the sand runs out

I want to be runnin' when
The sand runs out
Ooo, yes I do",When the Sand Runs Out

I'm a leaf holding on

I'm a thirsty man let me drink you in
I am on my way
You're a mountain top

When I reach for you
Your love lifts me up
And all that I want is to be
Where you are

I'm the frozen ground
You're the warm sunlight
Shining down on me
Baby, just in time

I have never been in love like this
Oh, you move my soul every time we kiss
And I love how you heal
I can't believe how alive I feel

Rascal Flatts,"Sara Beth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well, since the day that she fell
And the bruise it just won't go away

So she sits and she waits with her mother and dad
And flips through an old magazine
Till the nurse with the smile stands at the door
And says will you please come with me

Sara Beth is scared to death
'Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white, something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you

Six chances in ten, it won't come back again

It's just been approved, it's the strongest there is
And I think that we caught it in time

Around and around without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And a soft wind is blowing her hair

Sara Beth is scared to death

'Cause it would be a mistake for someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom

Red wine buzz kickin' in
A little Sarasota moonlight
Driftwood fire burnin'

She was on break from Ohio State
And I was down there sellin' para sail rides
Just another summer day
'Til I strapped her in and watched her fly

Talk about a sunset
All I could see were purples and reds
And her silhouette wavin' goodbye
She didn't come there lookin' for love

Neither did I
And neither did I

The day she parked on I-65
Found her on the shoulder cryin'
She didn't know where she was

It's like her mind just quit
Oh, but bring up Grandpa
It's like someone flipped a switch

A front porch light and a blue DeSoto
Couple of straws in a Coca-Cola
You could see it all goin' down
A handsome boy in army green

A tear on his face, down on a knee
Shaky voice, a diamond ring
She'll put you in that town
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas, 1948

She takes out his medals
A cigar box of letters
Sits and scatters pictures
Black and whites of days gone by

We started losing her when she lost him
But to hear her carry on
You'd swear she's seventeen again

Football games and leaves are cracklin'
Walking her home in his leather jacket
You can see it all goin' down
A perfect night on a front porch glider

Sayin' goodnight for the next three hours
Her tired eyes grow wide and bright
When she talks about that town
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today

Own my mistakes

Then I wouldn't be bitter
I'd just be better now

I'd be much better off
Much better off, maybe
If I could just let it go
With no regrets then

Next time, I won't suffer this kind of pain
Own my mistakes

That took me in and out of buildings
Behind windows, walls and doors
And I thought I found it
Couple times, even settled down
And I'd hang around just long enough
To find my way back out
I know now the place that I was trying to reach
Was you, right here in front of me

And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breakin'
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me here, right here

It's amazing what I let my heart go through
To get me where it got me
In this moment here with you
And it passed me by
God knows how many times
I was so caught up in holding
What I never thought I'd find
I know now, there's a million roads
I had to take
To get me in your arms that way

And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breakin'
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me here, right here

In a love I never thought I'd get to get to here
And if that's the road
God made me take to be with you

And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breakin'
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears

As he held it in his hand
Said, ""You be good and I'll be bad""

And the keys to Jenny's heart

Or the train comin' on
Now there's a wreath and two small crosses
On the right side of the road
Reminders of a love that won't grow

When they see it all played out
And as they stand with their hands tied

And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way

Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye


Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye

Rascal Flatts,"There's a Mountain Dew can with lipstick on it

He just leaves it back there,
One of the things he has left of her
When he drives into the late day sun
You can see a set of footprints.
He ain't going to clean that windshield,
He'd rather just live with the hurt.

He's holdin' on to the wheel
To the way she made him feel.
To the shifter, to the pictures.
Every precious moment with her.

Oh, he's holdin' on.

There's that voice mail on his cell phone
He don't dare erase.
She ended with I love you,
And he saves it just in case
It might still be true.
No he ain't through.

A little bit more gone a little less twisted around

I'm still stuck, I'm still here, in this rut

Looking back on everything that we had
Holding on to words that we can't take back
What am I to do with the past, when it's all that I have,
And I can't get you back

Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go, I'm reminded of us
Where we've been, all we've done, and all the love that we shared
Once, oh, once

I remember you sayin' I was the one,
And nothing could change that but you were wrong
It's funny how life turns on a dime now we don't even talk
I just stare at these walls

And I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go I'm reminded of us
Where we've been all we've done and all the love that we shared
Once, you made the world feel so right
Once, you were my morning noon and night
Why'd we slip away, why did it all change,
How will I ever be the same

Till he hears a little voice holler 'daddy's home'

When the cold hard rain just won't quit

Was there anything I could have said or done
Oh I, had no clue you were masking a troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong, and why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song

Now in my mind I keep you frozen as a seventeen year old
Roundin' third to score that winning run
You always played with passion no matter what the game
When you took the stage you shined just like the sun

Was there anything I could have said or done
Oh I, had no clue you were masking a troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong, and why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song

Now the oak trees are swayin' in the early autumn breeze
The golden sun is shining on my face
The tangled thoughts I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that bad a place

Oh why there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to judge or explain
Oh, but I do have one burning question
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight

Raise my hands up to the father
Gave it all to him that day
Felt a new wind kiss my face
Walked away, eyes wide open

I got off track, I made mistakes
Back slid my way into that place where souls get lost

There I was, now here I am

Like gravel to skin

Are pieces and parts

How was I to know
Like a hammer to my soul
You would break me down so easily
Now baby here I am
Left with half of could have been

Four MCs, four minds combined in rhyme(x3)

And it goes,like this
I'll take it straight to that face plate
Snatch and make it detach (what now)
Cause what i bring's the natural dispatch
I'm magical
Word up, I got It like that
I'm just sayin what's on my mind 
When I rhyme
And that's the bottom line
Heavy stress got a nigga thinkin that he must be trippin
I'll be runnin rings around the rhymes that they be whippin
And they know it
But still they must be frontin
Cause I'm sayin somethin
That they don't want to hear
So now there's nothin (nothin)
But opposition to my every way of life
I'm sayin I'm a bring it on cause I must
Yo I'm bustin rhymes 
Cause its fresh when you def with linguistic, artistic
I mean this rap thing, is the shit kid (word up)
Gettin paid is a priority
No Doubt
So run that route
Well quit the runnin at the fuckin mouth
Yo It'll never be the same, like it use to be
Too many half steppers that want to be up in the industry
So yo i drop some science every demo i make
It's like, how you livin homes
Kinda trife and it ain't that great
I want to mansion and a yacht and all that bullshit
The niggas compromise they own integrity to get it
Now maybe that's the price to be paid for the riches
Sell your fuckin soul to the Devil
Now those suns a bitches (word)
Are tryin to tell me that my rhymes is to abbrasive and aggressive (what?)
My street warrior attitude ain't impressive

I move onto the scene like a graphic
I flow like traffic
I'm at my peak each and ever hour
When I get a rush
I gotta bust with the midas touch
Grab a hold of the steal an grip it with the camels clutch
Let em feel
Hear and bear witness
As I reveal the sickness
That's been quaratined and revealed
When I redeam
By Red who's One with creation
In time in this space
And rhymin a nation
Forever chasin
Hip Hop
Until da final act of death
Takes my last breath
Odesables of saren vega make me go def
With nothin left
But the force that creates life
Which is the soul
Takes me to the next life
Where I will still rock your bone
The side is told
But not believe
Its the grasp and behold
The energy they envy
Manafested in me
>From the donnig of time
'Till the dusk of eternity
Def scripts there will only be

We move like clockwork
Individual gears movin in sync
Condition
And executed with procision
The regular recital of rhymes remains
One of the many mechanisms used to escersize the brain
So stay wise

Because they don't stop
Hip Hop, you don't stop (stop)

Open your eyes
Before the alarm sounds
Countdown, the year 2000
The path gets dramatic
Time to drop mathematics
I figure
Four MCs in a circular configure-ation
Is an eventuall progression
Time is of the essence
Its the essence of this profession
To help make suggestions
Evolve from shadows
The day is now digital
Whatever the means
Times is still critical
So don't clock this work
But take it for what its worth
Clockwork
So syncronize your inc and rise
don't blink your eyes
Cause we're on the brink of demeise
So sit and re-think the lies
Flipout, is what would describe me best
So let me Flipout
and take this mess from my chest

Movin like the hands of time
Four MCs combined together in rhyme

Its like clockwork
we stockin up the rhymes
But the clerk at the counter be the misfit
Spellin out rhymes from the mind
So check it
If you want to get jerked by the collar
Then gettin pulled from behind
The Misfit (Misfit)
You try to holla at the boys
Checkmate, Red, Flipout
Yes, indeed Misfit
So instead I think you should step
To the side (to the side)

Dreaded fist from the Northwest...

First before my verse, make Boodah bless you
Because he blessed me, in form of smoke from a tree
With abilities to summon powers of the Dreaded Fist
As a lyricist, to the world as a terrorist
So from a distance, you see shrapnel and debris
And in an instant you've got to recognize it's me
Black Belt, afferent to the eighth degree
The champion is me, Red One
Because I be the, a veteran, me all veteran
I'm gettin' on with the knowledge
To make moves strong, and abolish
Terrorizing tracks like Gengis Kahn
We be the rawest, hardest from the Northwest Side, dun
And that's, word to the uplifted fist of the dread, clear
Cutting emcees like McMillan and Blodell, so go tell
a friend, and so on and so on
The movement of this Dreaded Fist no longer will be slept on

[Chorus, Red One]
Dreaded Fist of the Northwest
Gotta be cautious
How we exhibit our style to the people
Lethal doses leaves comatose hits
To match the Fist, there's no equal to this

[Misfit]
A way with words is chosen right to explain
Poetry in my motion, coasting
In and out of range, to maintain
I switch up the timing
Keep surprising, line by line
A continuous jabbing unto you, into your pressure spot
I pinpoint with an index finger
Inject, to let the rhyme linger
Lyrically, do a number, in the ring
Physically, the champion of Welterweights in my division and skill
Aging to get better, somehow, someway
Maybe this Dreaded Fist will meet it's match someday
So then I stay, and with my words I don't play
Though I fate, and patiently wait for made mistakes

""Flip back, get into a fighting position""

[Red One]
Slip me in the chamber
Cock it back, toss me instrumentals, and watch me bust on that
They must (be) on crack, wanting they wigs split back
Cause we run this, and it's a well known fact
Never miss, all veteran and specialist
Messing with the best? Please, you can't handle this
It's too scandalist and dangerous for those trying to be framing us
Enslave us, lining up our anuses and bust
But, I don't think so
Who the fuck you think this is?
It's the Rascal, Red One, baddest in this rap biz
Rap with the Misfit, I get the beats off of Kemo
Stay froze and oppose like we boys of Serrengettal
Rock like metal, plus we heavy on the pedal
The chosen, to rule over the bass and the treble
For those and, for those and those who be opposing
They scared cause they know we eat the mic like errosion

[Chorus, Red One]

[Misfit]
We are the Dreaded Fist style lyricists
Once we start to kick the flows, continuous and dangerous
To be facing us you see, easily pick apart, your gameplan
It seems to me, you can't withstand the sting of the jab
I see the stagger, in your step, you cannot fool
A master of deception, expect the to fall
I'm going for the sternum, flexin'
Verbal skill, it is also an anotomical weapon
I hope I knock some, sense into ya
Coming way, pay attention to the rhymes that we say
Representing from this day forth, the Dreaded Fist
FitnRedi, on the mission

""Flip back, get into a fighting position""
""Put on a bulletproof, it'll bust your chest""

[Chorus, Red One]",Dreaded Fist
Rascalz,"As we emerge from the woodwork
Step in to the front
Take control
Its like clockwork
Well I knock first
To pre-warn of my presence
About to enter
And overflow the trauma center
So recommend ya to think twice
FitnRedi dishin out rhymes by the slice
But of course
There's a price  
For everything now
And with the beats from Kemo
They're made to entice
The fealin of temptation
And the thoughts of should I or shouldn't I
Gotcha complicated
Yea, the rhyme's stated
Opposition can't debate it
The jealous hate it
While the ignorance is there
Rated are for Renegade
Red-1 rock steady
Connect wit the fit
Never miss cause we ready
To grab the mic
And show you who got the clout
Dwell, drown last minute in this world title bout
So sound the bell
An lets do this
Taken
Whoever got bones to pick
Like an archiologist
Speak now
While we be on the topic
And if not
Shut ya mouth while we drop it

Chorus:
When I plan my attack I doubt that ya ready
Red-1 and Misfit come into this we rock steady 
When I plan my attack I doubt that ya ready
So think it over before you make moves of a soldier

I snatch the mic
With the blindedness
Speed of the mantis
Pray my things don't cross ya path
For bigets
Were in my favor
The closer we stand
To dividedly running
Is my specialty
So test me
Show inflexability
Rappin and kickin simple similies
At all you lazy
And to the non beleiver
Yes
Its the one and only
None of the rest
Run parallel to me
Like an analogy
I got to be
Coming in first
Its my hobbie
So the last one of the block
Simply cause I'm cocky
Floating
A butterfly stinging like a ??????
I told you long time
You must go down
Before my science
Leavin you deaf
Comin blind

Yea
Set of this ritual while burnin insence
Drop to my knees
Ask for guidance while on the offense
The dead presidents
The obligations to my soul
Leavin to stratigics
Its all mind control
Self discipline
With ambition be my conditionin
Never missin
Demolition 
For all opposition
And that's straight up
Because this ain't no joke
You gots to be fitnredi
We ain't gentle folks
We be renegades
proceed to engage and rock
Never failed a class class
Sound like we's down wit Pac
Shit still on lock
And figure four got the stock
Plus we the foundation for these dreaded juggernauts
Who got world domination on the mind
Done to our design
East 33rd's the first place that i'll be in my shrine
Steady train
Keep fit and maintain
Master Red-1 renegade
True to this game

Chorus

Its just one a them thangs
You know
don't take it personal
And if you do 
When ya coming
Bring ya arsenal
Because
Who don't take heed
Indeed will feel
You need conditionin
Go get the lyrics of steel
And take a listenin
You see you nothin but a tourist
In the land of the fittest
You just a low life forest
Hip Hop stranger
Now ain't nothin that can save ya
Cause ya buck up in a Red
Now ya in a danger

Yea
Same goes for Misfit
Rockin ya will like a manger
So baby listen
And then
I am the player
Who is most valuable
Reckin with the flows that's infalable
It be

Get it heated real quick

Stay international with the ill I-D-O
Money making flows, pesos from Mexico
To European ends and yens from Tokyo
Amend for the years that we rocked skid row
In a trash bungalow, trying to juggle our flow
But you know how the struggle go, life move slow
Yo, plus it's extra hard when you got no dough
But we strive on, mentality stay strong
Dropping bombs on the world from North West Saigon
Deep in the Babylon, def gone won watch them run

Now, this is a message in the bottle, like Robinson Caruso

So I open seven shakras, break the seven seals
Bust the dopest poetry rhyme just like Kaleel

It's that of the dreaded fist with Misfit and Red 1
I used to read the psalms and uhh, holy Koran
Now I only read the birds in the trees, then I'm gone
Like a breeze on a summer day, never run away
From the judgment day when Armageddon come say
If I had 24 hours to live, here's what I'd do
I'd make everybody know G-O-D's inside of you
And spread love from Kelowna to Kalamazoo

And I'm gonna be there, spreading the vibe

Four elements, we taking it, with that we making it
Honeys be shaking it, my vibe relating it
To the DJs 'round the world, they can done
Spin this in their cipher, and you're sure of the number one spot
In my category, you'll be my heart
So pump that shit for me, through the intercity
So they can bug off the ill hop hop
The Rascalz crew, and you we just don't stop
So take it to the top, and rock the world with the hot onslaught
You can't leave, 'cause the rhythm and rhyme got ya caught

Mother Africa wants me

Humidity heated when I step in the arena, 
Better come cleaner with felonies, what you're tellin' me's misdemeanor, 
Bombs go off like firecrackers, stackin' my foes like bricks, 
Hoes on the mic like tricks, 
Get 'em up hit 'em up, lit 'em up, I move too quick

Chorus:

y'all niggas ain't got no win, let the muthafuckin' games begin,
y'all niggas ain't got no win, let the muthafuckin' games begin,
y'all niggas ain't got no win, let the muthafuckin' games begin,
y'all niggas ain't got no win, let the muthafuckin' games begin,
y'all niggas ain't got no win, let the muthafuckin' games begin,
y'all niggas ain't got no win, let the muthafuckin' games begin,
y'all niggas ain't got no win, let the muthafuckin' games begin,
y'all niggas ain't got no win, let the muthafuckin' games begin

[Rasheed]
Rasheed lyrical gladiator, hysterical bustin' at a hater, 
In an all black navigator, 
Too sick to see with these suicidal symphonies, 
To get with me handle business efficiently, 
Officially certified platinum with these lyrical murders, 
Servin' a Hell of punch crunch time,
Blowin' like landmines, 
Brainless bodies droppin' in no particular order, 
Prepare for slaughter ammunition is gettin' shorter, 
Teleport the blood sport to ghetto block, put the game on lock, 
Nigga try to put 'em in shock,
With the crocodiles, 
Watch his muthafuckin' head drift down the Nile, 
Graphic murders three dimensional witch doctors,
Killin' like Shaka, from Port Lovaca to Morocco.

Chorus

[Rasheed]
Demolition turn your hood into a sand castle, 
Take the rest of your posse, wrap 'em up in a lasso, 
Tarintino couldn't come more loony, 
Strikin' folks from dusk to dawn like George Clooney, 
Amazons want me in this jungle but I'm burnin' titans, 
Til' I'm attacked by my foe and then it's back to fightin', 
Bring your army meet me in the middle of the Atlantic, 
And we can go out in war on a sinkin' Titanic, 
Don't panic, least you got granted to be a millionaire, 
Let's purchase two one way tickets on Egypt Air, 
Library, mortuary,
In front of your house or the cemetery, 
Any time, any place, I'ma do whatever's necessary

Rasheed,"[Chorus, Russell Lee x 2]
This is my passion 
You know a playa like me is always ready for action
Singin a child of the ghetto and I'm known for blastin
And won't quit till I get my satisfaction my satisfactio

[Rasheed]
I get the rush on the stage
From the words I put on the page
Lions in the cage
Rippin up in a criminal rage
Hot we passionate dashin inside the ghetto maze
Shinin like Uranus
Bring sun to you on rainy days
Ways of the wise don't kill the messenger before the message
You know me Rasheed from Philly to the Houston, Texas
Californi-A got a team in the bay L.A.
We universal
Still buildin our circle sendin soldiers
Out in full dispersal
Hot hot meet the eye of the storm in human form
Ring the alarm swarmin with this wicked storm
Bede bede bing yiiiii that's how I bust em
No discussion or repercussion rush little mudafuckin crushin
Blood in my body 
Sweaty tears give a nigga spasms
Make the average female listen to close and have a orgasm
I have em by the tens of thousands lightin my fire
'Cause livin through me they feel the passion of my desire

[Chorus Russell Lee x 2]

[Grimm]
I walk with my feet on the street
The beats gonna keep my lyrics complete
My philosophy the block gone bleed
But is you hearin the G-are-I double M
Violin brown
Recluse the spider Grimm
I an him the ryhmin twin shadows on my mind again
Find a pen thoughts in a poetic perspective
Effective word defective
Know every line is dissected
Rhyme and respected
Stay connected
The matrix is my guide
Immortalized by words on Earth
I keep my faith in God
Crazy inferno flame so much affection
Mental erection
Melodies take me like a demon hat's under possession
Hot we heated like them boys in the prison institution
With a appetite for freedom who gonna light them fuses
Abusin everything
I love till I reach the greatest ultimatum extraordinary
But on the contrary
Countin my blessings with the skills to give these verbal lessons
Keep my focus never sell out make maneuvers with discretion

[Chorus, Russell Lee x 2]

[Rasheed]
In the Dope House you know is where we makin our moves
Please don't hate us cause we blowin up like hot air balloons
Everybody in the studio we puttin it down
Rasheed, Grimm, and I
We won't quit to the day we die
And we try to abide by the rules of the game
And we hide when we ride fuck the bitches and the fame
All about my cash flow you betta move over we in the fast
Ain't gonna stop till we get the thousand plaques maan
So many fallen off cause they wasn't real to the heart
Gotta keep it as true as I can from the movie screen to the rappin art
Apart of the chosen few showin you how it really is
Really don't matta how you do it just go pursue kid
Great minds settin a trend for my generation
Bottom up that's how I'm buildin my foundation
I have em to the tens of thousands lightin my fire
Cause livin through me they feelin the passion of my desire

Fifteens in my shit, you know it's gon' bump
Nelly ridin' shotgun, nigga, pass the blunt
We into what-ever, and keepin' it crunk
Got twenty-inch BB's on my white Benz truck

Aw shit, we done did it again
From A-T-L to the new, but still breakin' 'em in
Playin' to win, fire hot, burnin' ya skin

From Old McDee to Cambleton flippin' birdies
Bendin' and swervin', I got this muthafucka turnin'
Threw up the double are, heard the sirens, kept it burnin'

On them thungs and crunk as hell
Your system blast then let it bump
Spark the L and raise it up

I'm 'bout to pull up in the A-T-L, eighteen inches and five screens
Old folks on the side and they reachin' for Visine
Five bitches right behind me, more flashin' than high beams
Like, Nelly, where you goin', can I go? By all means

Keep the door open, drivin' the ave, mami get in
Matter fact, don't ya come without, whoo, bringin' ya friends
One shotgun, three in the back, one on my lap
What's the outcome, we in the sack like Warren Sapp

Open ya mouth hun, ""We don't do that"", don't give me that
Why ya tongue done, say ""Aah"", fuck it, that's what I thought
I was peepin' that since the first time I saw ya
Timed ya walk from there to the time I parked

So keep ya one eye open for the haters that gawk
But still thugged out, candy coated and thugged out
Real stud guy, blink, now the guns out
I'm a show you what that A-T-S-T-L is about, dirty

On them thungs and crunk as hell
Your system blast then let it bump
Spark the L and raise it up

I love wood grain and, tinted, painted, and dusted out
Threw on some new shoes, drop the top and skated out
Then I hit the block, non stop, numero uno
Iced up, platinum bitch, breakin' niggas to the zero

Call me the hero, better yet, the Lieutenant
Takin' charge of the game, best believe I'm gon' win it
See, it ain't no thing for me to put it down
You jumpin' out your draws for this bitch from down south

Now put 'em up, and throw your hands in the air
Now tip the cup, like you just don't care
Stepped in the club, with my niggas from the D-Low
We keep this thing crunk and droppin' bows on them hizzoes

Shawty let's crank this shit
A little something for them hatin' hoes
Who gets nothin' but them knees and boes
Why y'all all in my grill,
Why y'all can't keep it real
Always tryin' to plot and scheme
Want to live this life is just a dream
Ain't no I in teams
All the real niggas know what it mean
Catch me y'all just to slow

Don't never try to stop my flo'
Won't tell you this shit no mo'

Two triple O, shawty bout that green

You can tell a real nigga from the fake fake
A trill nigga that's down in the cake cake
A hot girl that's clean not stank stank
Some bad weave for somebody
So you took a little drank
So I guess it made you think that you could when you can't
Wit the N with the ain't
Ain't nobody got time round here to playing round
Sucker with the big sack nigga better lay it down
Comin' through ain't bout that shady shit
Boy I'm mo' dirty than Dusty Rhodes

So don't you try to test us out thinkin' we country wit no skills

From the front to the side to the back, Rasheeda, and I'm tight like that
I ain't never been worried bout another
Cutter her buddy, lil buddy I don't studder
9 double lock chrome for the lame lame
Big faces in my pocket not the chump change
Ride the Benz with the wood grain, grilled out, smoke frame,
With the knock knock
38 pop pop all you haters just stop
Or you gone get dropped

From thirty piece to quarter ki we strictly on the grind
No time to spit no evidence, no evidence, no charge
Since they ain't got no evidence

To do what it takes to keep a nigga on my team

Just to keep in touch, that's how a nigga gotta live
I know you know how to keep this thang tight
I'm out doin' me, so I ain't with you every night

It's easy to see, baby I meant to be yo wife
But I can't slow down, nigga I got my own life
So get on in, when you fit in, don't trip
I stack the dough, I run this shit, got you lovin' this

I only got two days, so we gots to lay it down

You know how we do, in the Dirty, we live it up
When I get to the crib, ain't no frontin', give it up
We're landing in Atlanta, so it's time to crank it up
We get on the round lil' man say back it up

I'm lookin' around, there you are just like you saw

Between me and you let's keep it one on one
Check them hoe's on the side before them bitches get done
Got no time for the games, I'm collectin' more change
And flip it to bills so we can take it long range

You know what it is, and how it's goin' be
Everywhere that you go, you comin' right back to she
I'm makin' it known for all these hoe's to see
They already know that you belong to me

First thangs first, I sheeda
Fuck around with no man who wount eat her
I don't need em, ain't tryin to see em
Yo mommy, daddy, them, ain't tryin to meet em
Halmark cards, ain't tryin to read em
Yea I can cook, but I ain't tryin to feed him
Nothing but this vagina, steven
Ya dick little, need ya tongue to make it even
Slow down, stop speeding
You 20 something, suppose to been stop teethin
Its been 20 mintues, has this nigga stop breathin
I know he down there, I ain't even seen him

You on the run, gotta federal case?
I know a place you can bury your face
Yum yum, gone get ya a taste
Gotta shake, let it go like mase
But ya tongue gotta know how to act
From the front all the way to the back
Its therapeutic and it helps me relax
I got them goodies, boy get you a snack
I dare a nigga try to act like he don't want to
Hate women, niggas say what he wount do
You talkin to a girl standin on her own two
If I want to, I can do it with my own two
So you gotta work it, do some tongue tricks
It takes dedication, I don't cum quick
So put ya shoulders in it, catch a neck cramp
Cause I gotta have that tongue like a wet stamp

Wassup baby? you scared?
Put my hands on the back of your head
And keep it there, don't stop

Rasputina,"The similarities in situation between the Donner Party and the colonial Pilgrims is both appalling, frightening, and incomplete. 
In both cases, you'll find one: a fairly large group of ill-prepared greenhorns, pitting themselves against nature and each other, two: an insufficient willingness to endure the very real hardships of frontiering, and three: coincidental misfortune at every turn. Number three: coincidental misfortune at EVERY TURN. 
The disasters of both camps were initially brought about by departure delay-inducing inertia, which caused our heroes to begin their journeys at absolutely retarded times weather-wise. 
If fantasy is the refuge of the frightened man, and a castle in the air is safe harbor for a foolish few, just imagine: 
Living in a hut buried twelve feet below the snow, where the sight and smell of the scattered carcasses of loved ones at your feet, is...the lay of the land. Just another day.
I would like to propose that cannibalism was indeed rampant among America's earliest settlers: the Pilgrims.

The Pilgrims. For what does ""settler"" imply, if not the willingness to settle? The willingness to settle for a meal of human flesh if my thoughts on the subject are to believed.

From the grocery store to the B.Q.E. 
With their hearts all aglow from her icy back-at-you stare. 
When her teeth became tight when her eyes couldn't see. 


And she told herself that this was enough. 
For a girl who was born in an oil-drum 
She had her skates didn't need lots of stuff. 
She didn't need it but she still wanted some. 


She had one thing that she liked and she kept around 
She would take it with her to the riverbed. 
As she skated around she always thought of a pretty sound 
That she heard as a girl in her mother's bed. 
The sound of some breathing another breath in and out 
When some lungs expand and contract like they do. 
And she looked at herself in the ice of the riverbed and 
She saw a girl one which she could see through. ",Rusty the Skatemaker

Roubar um beijo 
A gente sai, sorri de lado
Um novo amor tava atrasado 
E dispara o coração
Porque beijo é bom roubado 
Sem cobertura da razão

Pega Ladrão, pega Ladrão
Devolve o beijo que um só beijo é tentação
Pega Ladrão, pega Ladrão
Devolve o beijo que um só beijo é tentação

Tem beijo de Borboleta
Tem beijo de carioca

Já esta passando a data
Céu de estrelas sem você

No meio das despedidas

No inverno sinto frio,
No outono, amor, quem dera
No verão não vou morrer de amor

Now they've got pig fat injected to their six pack

En su soledad?
Guarda sus rencores,
Deformando la verdad.

Vieja vagabunda

Que gobierna el mundo
Oculta en la oscuridad.

Destruyes el camino digno entre hombres.
No dudas condenarlos con discursos que van a ensuciar
Su mejor verdad,

Sus ganas de dar...

Ratcat,"I met her at the kindergarten,
She wore her hair in pig tails,
She had teeth like a rabbit,
And you know she loved to eat snails.

It was true lust,
I've never felt these feelings,
Before her.

We would play in the dirt together,
We would trade bugs all the time,
One day I gave her a spider,
She said she would be mine.

It was true lust,
I've never felt these feelings,
Before her.

She was great on the jungle gym,
There ain't a tree she can't climb,
She was great at everything,
And she was mine.

There ain't no happy ending,
When my baby doll moved away,
My heart was filled with sorrow,
For whom with, was I to play ?
 
It was true lust,
I've never felt these feelings,
Without her.",True Lust

And I don't want to let you go-oh-woh.

Beat to the sound of a song.
A beat everlasting, and twice as

This taste is not quite of you.
This scent seems strange to me too.
Your touch is so cold, what sacrifice
Made for this to be you.

The world keeps spinning around
Sometimes I'm losing my head.
Lost up above, I see the stars

I adore you,

Never let you go,

Running and jumping, the rain's falling down.
Screaming and thumping, my mind is not around.
It's the wonder of me for you.
Floating and flying, my hearts in the sky.
Living and dying, do you? I wonder why.

It's the wonder of me and you.
At midnight, we scream and we fight,
Then we make love, til sleep is the only retreat.
Screaming and laughing, my head's long for gone.

I used to shit on NYU kids, soused after dark
To the point they be like ""again this little fart had to start""
Seems random, like Stanford transplanted to the fountain and the arch
Infecting the apple, a cancer in its heart
Why'd you make a campus out the park?
If it keeps spreading, It'll be deaded
Panting and parched
How you supposed to be handsome and harsh?
How you supposed to be standing for New York?
Dismantling New York?
The apple is rot, The grapple is caught
Had to free that
So instead we would rap at West 4th
For weed dealers, who could see clearer, that we realer
Offer to hustle for 'em, rather just bust it for em
Is selling swell? Do you earn well?
Are you in the Pelle Pel? Or the Marm shell?
Same place you hear the devil yell

Everyone give credit, hell Let these words sell

I prefer a roof, stoop, fire escape

If I was too high for the train, walk blocks
Some where killers have been slain
Others where killing have been made
Buildings have been raised
There ain't no block the same that's chilling in the maze
Thinking back on second grade, thinking that second plane
More telling, over heard my uncle telling his day
Rememberin' what came
People melting, swelling my brain
Yet remain, compelling to maintain
But got these grimey cats selling their cane
To shorty like a twelfth of their age
I ain't tyring to, threaten your ways
Judge you or get in debates
But i'm spitting so i get to explain
I don't veto votes, I veto coke
I don't really fucks with it
Seen too many bitches stuck with it
If i'm bout to get sucked with it
Duck quicker than Quidditch
Land on a blunt and i'm with it

Whole numbers tend to come from cold tundras

The Hudson a flowing
Carrying Russian locust, Irish locust, Puerto Rican locust
Get off the boat and seeking, to go kiss the golden streets, but

The beast, the trees, the spore, the man, the rest
Rotten buffaloes on the prairie, no not the pain

If all beasts were gone, life as one
Man would die from a great longing to sing
Cling to calls and fallen wings

In my ear saying ""Suck this dick 'fore I get sadistic""

Yin and yang, either stinging with pain or bringing that grain
Either way yo it's all the same thang
Thinking, might it be worth it, life in the circle, write in my journal
My journals the, city it flows with the prettiest prose
Mixed with the gritty and gross, I pity the
Hideous shmoe, not the idiot shmucks, still giving a fuck

Wrists carved up, from center street souls
Whose scars won’t shut, no scars won’t shut!
Back in kickball they were the kids that got cut
Type to lick ya tears off, poke ya gut and such
Now who’s stuck? And where’s my luck?
Barged baxter in bayard boom, where’s my buck?
You wouldn't last long on Lennox, you scared to come up
But you need to be as scared of the come up
When you need to be shootin' shoats and saving the young pups
Torrid heat, Time Square post let it erupt
We’re bashing and barking like, dogs in the fog
Down the South, slow draws, haggard hogs
I can feel ya hunger baby, scribble and make ya starve
Taught you 'bout tatted walls, scratched and scattered scrawls
Night you like to breathe but you talk timid towards tamed with awe
And tongues rip through holes with pockets to draws
I was born in the ocean and adapted to life ashore
Take it as a simple world, world, world
Guess I’m spatting off like hell, now what the hell
All the, all the, sick stories to tell
Sittin' in ya cell thinkin' to yourself, ""how'd I fail""
Well, why’d I wail?

Ratt,"I could take you wanted someone to call your own
Sweet sixteen, you couldn't see straight
You couldn't let go
Now you're eighteen and you barely make a sound
You're getting older, a little bolder
You're in the lost and found

All the way you say you'll take me
Any day you'll never break me

Slip slip
Slip of the lip
I like the way you move your hips
Loose lips
Sink ships
The way you move, you don't miss

I said I told ya, I'll get to know ya
We're goin' all the way
Move over, I'm gonna hold ya
To everything you say

And now I've showed you baby everything's okay
When I hold ya and when I show ya
You're gonna want to stay

All the way you say you'll take me
Any day you'll never break me

You're so bad, your reputation
You know it's all the same
It's just a game

Good luck and that's enough, yeah
First take, it's never too late
Cause I've been through it
Why don't we take a chance?

Hard times, it's alright
And you know that I've been through it

Ratt,"Right here
Is where
Your arm belongs
And I knew
From the start
I knew it all along

Feeling all my feelings
Playing with my fire
Make the next move
Kindles my desire

And I know what I'm thinkin'
That you know what I know
One thing's for sure's
That I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
Some things last forever
Stand the test of time
It's you and me together
That's the bottom line

Come Hell or high water
'Till the end of time
It's you and me forever
That's the bottom line

Was it love
Or a strange
Twist of fate
Hand in hand
Heart to heart
We took it on blind faith

Turnin' back the pages
And tryin' to find the facts
Our love is gettin' stronger
There's no turnin' back

No more nasty looks
You play no dirty tricks
Nothing here is broken
So there's nothing here to fix

[Chorus]

Never say never
Till the end of time
We'll go through Hell together
That's the bottom line

Ow!

If you want it
You know where to find it
It's forever
That's the bottom line

Don't forget it
You'll never regret it
We're together
That's the bottom line

Ow!

[Chorus]

Come Hell or high water
Till the end of time
It's you and me forever
That's the bottom line

Come Hell or high water
'Till the end of time, yeah!

No, no, never say never
That's the bottom line, yeah!

Ratt,"Ah yeah yeah

Wedding rings and pawns
Like the calm before the storm
Ten on the ten scale
When will the sun fail

When you're with me
I just can't breathe

Turn around come
Hit the ground

One, two, three
Satisfaction

That's a chain reaction
Just you and me
The only thing that gets me off
Will bring you to your knees

Like a dog without a bone
Twilight without the sound
Like ships without the sails
Ratt and Abbott tell no tales

When you're with me
I'm out of control
Ooh such a wild time
If there's a way to make you
Turn around and come
Hit the ground

Ratt,"Street fights all the time
I take a chance into the night
I've got to hear the thunder

Night life dies hard
Keeps me on my guard
It's like a spell I'm under

Cause I'm runnin' city to city
And all points in between
I'm movin' city to city
You can find me on the streets
Feel my heat

Dead heat makes me blind
You might think I'm a rebel kind
There ain't no way I'm gun shy

Dizzy blond out of reach
All my stuff on the asphalt beach
I know you think I'm crazy

Cause I'm runnin' city to city
And all points in between
I'm movin' city to city
I'm runnin' between the sheets

Oh!

City
(City)

Oh sit

Cause I'm runnin' city to city

I'm runnin' between the sheets

I'm runnin' city to city
And all points in between
I'm movin' city to city
I'm runnin' between the sheets
