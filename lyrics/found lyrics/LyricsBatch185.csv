Jackie Coon,"'Tention folks, speak of jokes
This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""

Jackie Coon,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love
Jackie Coon,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue.",Me and My Shadow
Jackie Coon,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,

Jackie Coon,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart",When I Grow Too Old to Dream
Jackie Coon,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Jackie Coon,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory

Jackie DeShannon,"I saw her today, I saw her face, it was a face I loved, and I knew
I had to run away, and get down on my knees and pray that they'd go away
But still they'd begin (uh), needles and pins (uh)
Because of all my pride, the tears I gotta hide

Hey I thought I was smart, I'd won her heart
Didn't think I'd do, but now I see
She's worse to him than me, let her go ahead
Take his love instead, and one day she will see
Just how to say please, and get down on her knees
Hey that's how it begins (uh), she'll feel those needles and pins
A-hurtin' her, a-hurtin' her

Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up and tell myself I'm strong

Jackie DeShannon,"Any day now I will hear you say ""Goodbye, my love""
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown, oh
Any day now I'll be all alone, whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Any day now, when your restless eyes meet someone new

Then the blue shadows will fall all over town, oh
Any day now love will let me down, whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa

Jackie DeShannon,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You [*]
Jackie DeShannon,"Like the beat, beat, beat,
Of the tom-tom;
When the jungle shadows fall,
Like the tick, tick, tock
Of the stately clock,
As it stands against the wall,
Like the drip, drip, drip,
Of the raindrops,
When the summer show'r is through;
So a voice within me
Keeps repeating,
You, you, you 

Night and day
You are the one,
Only you 
Beneath the moon
And under the sun.
Whether near to me or far,
It's no matter, 
Darling, where you are
I think of you
Night and day.

Day and night 
Why is it so,
That this longing for you follows
Where-ever I go?

In the silence of my lonely room,
I think of you,
Night and day.

Night and day
Under the hide of me

Jackie DeShannon,"I want a Sunday kind of love
A love that will last past Saturday night
And I've got to know it's more than love at first sight

I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do all my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone to enfold, to keep me warm
When those Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life, to have and to hold

Wednesday or Thursday, Friday or Saturday

Jackie DeShannon,"Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky, love
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down

The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone and the past is unknown
And there is no easy way down

No, it isn't very easy when you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy when each road you take
Is one more mistake, there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home, yeah

We all like to climb to the heights of love
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end when it's time to descend
That there is no easy way down

You know you're gonna find
There is no easy way down",No Easy Way Down
Jackie DeShannon,"THINK OF RAIN

	Words and Music by Margo Guryan




If you should think of leaving me
Think of rain
And think of yesterday again

Think of rain
Think of holding hands and running for cover
Laughing all the time
And stopping to kiss
Under the weeping willow tree

If I should break your heart one day
Think of rain
And maybe you will have to smile

Think of rain
Maybe then you will forgive me
I'd want you to forgive me

If one day you should think of leaving me

Jackie DeShannon,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true

Or I'll never fall in love

And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

Or I'll never, never, never give my heart

Like a drunk in a midnight choir

I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue

Like a beast with his horn

I will make it all up to thee.

To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise
Jackie DeShannon,"Go for a ride
In the still of the night
And morning brings forth
All this wonderful delight
Couldn't have made it more plain
When I heard that soft refrain
And I heard you gently sigh

Want to take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky
That's where flamingos fly

Lie in the dark
With the sound of the nightingale
Listen for a lark
I will tell you a tale
Breeze is blowin', blowin' outside
Want to take that moonlight ride
When I hear you gently sigh

Want to take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky

For that morning light to shine
And I'm looking at you looking at me looking right back at you
And I'm anticipating
Sounds along the way
Looking at you looking at me looking right back at you, hey

I'll follow the road
That will take me, take me right back home
And carry that load
Where the deer and the provincial angels roam
Happiness touches, touches me now
I know where it came from and how
When I hear you gently sigh

Want to take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky
That's where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over the rooftops of the houses
I heard it one time, I heard it one time in a lullaby

That I'll stand by you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear that he made you shed a tear

The stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of
Our dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining,
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees,
O hear the angel voices!
O night divine,
O night when Christ was born!
O night divine, O night,
O night divine!

Led by the light of Faith
Serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star
Sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus
In lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend!
He knows our need,
To our weakness no stranger;
Behold your King!
Before the lowly bend!
Behold your King! your King!
Before Him bend.

Truly He taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise His holy name!
Christ is the Lord,
Oh praise His name forever,
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
His pow'r and glory
Evermore proclaim.",O Holy Night

For that second chance.
For a break that would make it okay,

To feel not good enough,
And it's hard at the end of the day.

Oh, beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins,
Let me be empty
And weightless and maybe,
I'll find some peace tonight.

In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here,
From this dark cold hotel room.
And the endlessness that you fear,
You are pulled from the wreckage,
Of your silent reverie,
You're in the arms of the angel.
May you find some comfort there.

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn.
There's vultures and thieves at your back,
And the storm keeps on twisting.
You keep on building the lie,
That you make up for all that you lack.
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time.
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness, oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees.

In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here,
From this dark cold hotel room.
And the endlessness that you fear,
You are pulled from the wreckage,
Of your silent reverie,
You're in the arms of the angel.
May you find some comfort there.

Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye
To Bethlehem

Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him

Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word
Give to our Father glory in the Highest,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord

(All) Hail! Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning,
O Jesus! for evermore be Thy name adored

Jackie Evancho,"O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God our King
And Peace to men on earth

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Jackie Evancho,"We're walking in the air
We're floating in the moonlit sky
The people far below are sleeping as we fly

I'm holding very tight
I'm riding in the midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you

Far across the world
The villages go by like dreams
The rivers and the hills
The forests and the streams

Children gaze open mouth
Taken by surprise
Nobody down below believes their eyes

We're surfing in the air
We're swimming in the frozen sky
We're drifting over icy mountains floating by

Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep

We're walking in the air
We're Dancing in the midnight sky
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly",Walking in the Air
Jackie Evancho,"What child is this
Who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud

Jackie Evancho,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright,
And may all your Christmases be white

Jackie Evancho,"There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, as it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

Jackie Evancho,"Never knew I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the sky before
Want to vanish inside your wish
Every day the clouds clear more and more
Listen to my heart, can you hear it sing?
Telling me to give you everything
Seasons may change, winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around with you
And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather,
And stars may collide
But I love you (I love you)
Until the end of time(until the end of time)

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Oh, come what may, come what may
I will love you, 
oh I will love you

Come what may
I will love you until my dying day",Come What May [From Moulin Rouge!]
Jackie Evancho,"All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here, blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here, suddenly I see
Standing here, it's all so clear
I'm where I am meant to be

And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you

All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were

Now she's here, suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear

Jackie Evancho,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
(?)
For I compose the music of the night

Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your face away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
?
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you (?) You cannot find
The darkness of your music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to go
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music of (?)

I see you, I feel you,
That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold you
In my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way

Jackie Evancho,"Look at me
You may think you see
Who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day
It's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

I am now
In a world where I
Have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world
What's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection
Someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

There's a heart that must be free 
To fly
That burns with a need to know
The reason why

Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?

Jackie Evancho,"If you were in my eyes for one day
You could see the full beauty of the joy
I find in your eyes
And it isn't magic or loyalty

If you were in my heart for a day
You would have an idea
Of what I feel
When you hold me strongly to you
Heart to heart,
Breathing together

Protagonist of your love
I don't know if its magic or loyalty

If you were in my soul for a day
You would know what is inside me

At that instant, together with you
And what I sense
Its only love.",Se [From Cinema Paradiso]
Jackie Evancho,"Some enchanted evening you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see him again and again

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear him laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of his laughter will sing in your dreams

Who can explain it, who can tell you why
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel him call you across a crowded room
Then fly to his side and make him your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone

Once you have found him, never let him go
Once you have found him, never let him go",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific]
Jackie Evancho,"The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smooths the restless sky 
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summer time
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arm?

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

I see them bloom for me and you 
And I think to myself

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky 
Are also on the faces of people goin' by 
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin'

And who are you, the proud lord said
That I must bow so low?
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know

Or as unchanging as the sea 
But if you can still remember 
Stop and think of me

Which might have been

Si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quelli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono I pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica
Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaje,
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai,
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai",Caruso
Jackie Evancho,"I know that there are ghosts that haunt my mind
And sadness is a comfortable sublime
I'm sure that there's so much out there to find
For now I know these monsters aren't so kind

How long can we all survive
In this pitch-black paradise?
It's you
Keeping me alive

There's a ghost inside my head
And it's leaving me for dead
The haunting is all that I have left
And I'll never let him go
It's so dark and beautiful
The haunting won't let me forget

I know by now it's pointless to resist
Your voice a bittersweet goodnight kiss
Silence is a dangerous abyss
So whisper in my ear, let's reminisce

Jackie Evancho,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were

Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again, tell me, would we, could we

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun.

'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin',

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Jackie Gleason,"Sometimes when I feel low and things look blue
I wish a boy I had, say, one like you

Someone within her heart to build a throne
Someone who'd never part, to call my own

If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in this world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy
I could say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy

No one I'd ever care for, dear, but you
No one I'd fancy there for to love me too

Your eyes can set me dreaming all night long
Your eyes have set me scheming, right or wrong

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way,
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride

I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank,
Misfortune seemed his lot,

And we, we got upsot.

The story I must tell

And on my back I fell,
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight

Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Jackie Gleason,"I once had a gown, it was almost new
Oh, the daintiest thing, it was sweet Alice blue
With little forget-me-nots placed here and there
When I had it on, I walked on the air
And it wore, and it wore, and it wore
'Til it went, and it wasn't no more

In my sweet little Alice blue gown
When I first wandered down into town
I was both proud and shy, as I felt every eye
And in every shop window I primped passing by
Then in manner of fashion, I'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
'Til it wilted, I wore it, I'll always adore it
My sweet little Alice blue gown

The little silk worms that made silk for that gown
Just made that much silk and then crawled in the ground
For there never was anything like it before
And I don't dare to hope there will be any more
But it's gone, 'cause it just had to be
Still it wears in my memory

In my sweet little Alice blue gown
When I first wandered down into town
I was both proud and so shy, as I felt every eye
And in every shop window I primped passing by
Then in manner of fashion, I'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
So it wouldn't be proper if made of silk were another

Fling it wide open, for love locked out

Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me"
Jackie Gleason,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist, when baby will I know so well
That I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

I found it once but tossed it aside
I paid for it with hours of loneliness

Just one more chance
To prove it's you alone I care for
Each night I say a little prayer for
Just one more chance

Just one more night
To taste the kisses that enchant me
I'd want no others if you'd grant me
Just one more chance

I've learned the meaning of repentance
Now you're the jury at my trial
I know that I should serve my sentence
Still I'm hoping all the while you'll give me

But now I'm back to cry my heart out

His virtue doth parade

Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

Jackie Gleason,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

You know I'm yours for just the taking

I should have realized there'd be another man,

I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

Jackie Gleason,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love
Jackie Gleason,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow

When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow

Jackie Gleason,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

I'll always place the blame, dear, 
On nobody but you.
 
Yes, you, 
You're driving me crazy! 
What did I do? What did I do? 
My tears for you 
Make everything hazy, 
Clouding the skies of blue. 
 
How true, 
Were the friends who were near me to cheer me,

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,

Jackie Gleason,"They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me

Then I tumble out of paradise

Darn that one track mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Without that dream I never have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true

Jackie Gleason,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Jackie Gleason,"I always thought that I'd prefer single-blessed-ness
Thought that I'd like to stay free

No wedding bells for me, I've changed my mind after all,

I used to smile at all the songs that were popular,
Nothing but love in each song,
I used to think those kind of songs were foolish,
Now I admit I'm wrong.
Love songs are part of my plan, show me the minister man, for

I never knew I could love anybody,
Honey, like I'm loving you;
I couldn't realize what a pair of eyes and a baby smile could do.

From A to Zee,

Come hear the band,

With whom I shared four sorbid rooms in Chelsea.
She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower.

As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour.
The day she died the neighbours came to snicker
""Well, that's what comes from
Too much pills and liquor.""

But when I saw her laid out like a queen,
She was the happiest, corpse,
I'd ever seen

I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how she'd turned to me and say:
""What good is sitting alone in your room?

Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Jackie Greene,"So long, sentimental lady
Is there something that you’re trying to say to me?
Cinderella complicated
It ain’t how you thought that it would be

If I die before I wake
It must have been a bad mistake
Depending on the pills you take
Can complicate and devastate

Now estimate, your time on earth
Do you recall your place of birth?
And can you tell what it’s all worth
And are you really satisfied?

Paint me a picture of a baby
I want to see how lonesome I can be
I don’t want no one to save me
I’m not going to leave here silently

What I have and what I’ve lost and
Every coin I’ve fountain tossed
Like every line I thought I crossed
Just cut me when the winter frost

I paid the cost; your rebel dreams
Suitcases and magazines
And I know I ain’t alone

If I make it to the city
Won’t you do your best and honey pray for me?
They say that all the girls are pretty
They say that they don’t dance for free

But forks and knives and rusted spoons
Bottomless in basement rooms
Your worn-out brides and reckless grooms
Are building tombs with pink balloons

Darkness looms an airless night
Just a matchbook and some dynamite
And it won’t matter who’s wrong or right
'Cause they’re too tired to care

I can’t help it but to ramble
I don’t ever stay too long
Daddy warned you not to gamble
He said, “Just pass your chips along”

Nursery rhymes and valentines
‘Blessed be the tie that binds’
A thousand mouths can speak one mind
While love is still left undefined

And undermined, misunderstood
She hides beneath her happy hood
Saying, “What is God?” and “What is Good”
And, “Why am I still here?”",Down in the Valley Woe
Jackie Greene,"The night is gone
The time has come
To find a new day has begun
An' it promises to stay
To soothe the pain of wasted years
An' kiss away the bitter tears
A love to light the way

And from the darkness
Comes a smile
That reaches out for many miles
Touching everyone
No more shadows of the past
Your spirit free to fly at last
Shining in the sun

Like the rolling thunder
I feel the power of love
It's a gift from heaven
And the Lord above

We walk toward desire
Hand and hand
Through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day

Take it easy, take it slow
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
Places never seen before
'Cause I love you, an' I need you
I'll do my best to please you
My love can open any door

When you hear the thunder
In your darkest night
I'll be there to hold you
When the lightning strikes

So don't you worry,
You can ease your mind
'Cause we'll be dancing
At the end of time

Who loves you, who needs you
Who'll do his best to please you
I love you, I need you
I'll get down on my knees

We walk toward desire
Hand and hand
Through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day

Jackie Greene,"And the stars came out of the skies
And the rain was hidden by the tears in your eyes
And falling back is hard to do
When it's falling back in love with you

You know the lamp post understands
That you cannot look inside a man
But falling back is hard to do
When it's falling back in love with you

I don't mind your wishing games
Long as I can keep from feeling blue
Your mama's rich, I can tell by the way she walks
And I don't care about anything but you

So put your coat on, step outside
The car's gassed up for a midnight ride
And falling back is hard to do
When it's falling back in love with you

So I'll light another cigarette
Watch you as you tumble in your sleep
I've known you forever but it feels like we just met
And look at here, my heart is yours to keep

And the stars came out of the skies
And the rain was hidden by the tears in your eyes
And falling back is hard to do
When it's falling back in love with you

And don't try to ignore me
Just smile and wave your hand goodbye

To you I send a dozen roses
From every town that I've been in
And as long as leaves are falling
You know the shape that I've been in

On the gray side of the mountain 
You can hear my train go by
Baby, I can be forgiving
But I'm never satisfied

Chase the rain now from your heart dear
Cause I know you will survive
If I'm not living by the edge dear
Then I might not be alive

And in the winter of December
Turn your good side on the chill
And in the meantime please remember
I loved you then, I love you still

the moon was hanging high
i felt something wrong, something must be going on

now tell me what did i see?
i saw my gal and my best friend

Jackie Greene,"Out from my window, the people are passing on by
I hear them complain, but I know that they don't even try

And the lights down on main street don't shine like they used to
I'm thinking of nothing but spending a lifetime with you

You know that I love you, you know that I wait by the door
You know how I'm feeling, so I won't have to feel it no more

And nobody could love you
Like I can
Honey someday you'll wake up and maybe you'll understand

Well I've got a friend of a friend who drives a nice car
And I've got acquaintances down at the neighborhood bar

I got some women, stop by my home
But somehow I end up, waking each morning alone

The train that I ride's got nothing aside
From the phantom conductor with a dog at his side
And the ghost of a weeping, weddingless bride
Who should have been married but never arrived
And I see through the windows like I see through the lies
Like I see through every useless disguise
That everyone wears,
But everyone swears
That they don't 

Oh and don't mind me baby,
I'm only dying slow

I'm trying so hard, just not to think about you
I try not to care about anything that you do

4 in the morning, I can't sleep
Well the pills ain't working and I can't get no relief

I feel like a hound dog moaning along with the rain
Anyday now the jukebox could drive me insane

There's an old man in the corner
Nobody knows
He says laugh while you can 'cause someday you'll be wearing my clothes

Well I guess I can't tell you what you don't already know
I ain't no prophet my landlord he told me so

My mind is a burning rain 
Of Saturn Flame
I feel things inside that I
I just can't explain

Well I know that you know how to fake and to take 
What you break, what you burn, what you never did learn
And you turn and you say that you made a mistake
As your head starts to spin and your heart starts to ache
But all that you make will be all that you get
When the curtain goes down, so don't you forget
That all your regret is a cheap silhouette and that's all

Oh and don't mind me baby
I'm only dying slow

I met a gambler who did nothing but lose all day
He had love in his arms but he let her slip away

And all he ever wanted was to give her a win
But all she ever really wanted was him","Don't Mind Me, I'm Only Dying Slow"
Jackie Greene,"I was half asleep when I heard the news, sad words on the phone
I just couldn't believe my ears, I couldn't believe she's gone
I tried to make some sense of it, but sense I could not make
How a girl like her could go like that it must be some mistake

Well I'd known her since forever, or as far back as I go
She always had an answer for the things I didn't know
She never hurt anybody, never did them wrong
she walked to the tune of life teaching everyone the song

Now Emily's in Heaven, and I'm awake in bed
Sometimes how I wish, the Good Lord took me instead
But I guess the good die young and life just isn't fair
But Emily's in Heaven she'll be waiting for me there

Eleven different doctors and not one had a clue
They rushed her to emergency but there was nothing they could do
They said she had a weak heart, she'd always been that way
I said she just gave too much of it away

Now Emily's in Heaven, and I'm awake in bed
Sometimes how I wish, the Good Lord took me instead
But I guess the good die young and life just isn't fair
But Emily's in Heaven she'll be waiting for me there

We laid her down for peaceful sleep, time was standing still

I said goodbye with a rose how she loved them so

And I tell her, that It aint easy
To be a man like me
Yes I tell her, she listens, and she stands right by me
Oh she must mean everything to me

My baby's got the gentle touch, she got the champagne in her soul
She's crazy bout' candlelight and roses
She owns her body and her brain but her heart she can't control
She's everything to me and yes she knows it

And I tell her that it aint easy
To be a man like me
I tell her, she listens and she loves me tenderly
Oh she must mean everything to me

somewhere a father has lost his good son

But you said we'd meet again 

And when the storms that you once threw 
Get thrown back at you 
And you just can't stand to stand in your own skin 
I'll let you in 

I'm nailed to the tail of a whale 
At the bottom of an ocean 
Any day here I'll have to 
Come back up for air 

I'll be waiting for you baby 
In the city in the jungle 
Sitting pretty waiting for you 
Knock on my door 

So when the friends that you once knew 
Don't remember you 
And they tell you that you can't be born again 
I'll let you in 

I control the weather 
From a dial in the kitchen 
Lighting fires from the burner 
It's absurd but it works just fine 

I've been thinking about places 
I've been to and have loved me 
And I've had to been sad to 
Had to leave cuz things got lost 

[And when the friends that you once knew 
Don't remember you] 
And you just don't think you'll ever learn again 
I'll let you in

Jackie Greene,"Hey poor mama, 
what say you? 
what say you this day? 
Hey poor mama, 
where's your baby? 
Lost and gone away 

She went walking 
no goodbye's 
she went wandering astray 
Hey poor mama 
what say you 
what say you today? 

Cold black devil 
left us crying 
left us crying in shame 
No such Heaven 
Heaven gone now 
can't go on this way 

listen to me 
oh listen good 
oh listen good 
find a good man 
strong and able 
am i understood? 

He came from somewhere 
Big city somewhere 
Came with smoke in his eye 
Spending money 
Money, money 
Money, lust and pride 

He went talking 
Talked for miles 
Miles of fortunes he told 
Charmed our baby 
Right from our arms 
Right into the cold 

Hey poor mama 
what say you? 
what say you this day? 
Hey poor mama 
where's your baby 
lost and gone away? 

oh dig for silver 
dig for gold 
dig for diamonds too 
all that digging 
you'll get old 
it will bury you 

well i'll walk for, 14 miles 
and i'll run for 14 too

Jackie Greene,"There must be something wrong with me 
There must be something happening that I don't even see 
Whatever it's gonna be 
Oh it's just as well 

I can't believe the state I'm in 
I think I think too much and now my thoughts are wearing thin 
Where should I begin 
Oh it's just as well 

And all I wanted from you 
Love me like you wanted 
I can't keep your heart if your heart can't be kept satisfied 

I like to watch the sun go down 
?? on the other side of town 
Besides you ain't around, oh it's just as well 

So much for those summer days 
We use them up so quickly and 
Who cares anyway, oh it's just as well 

And all I wanted from you 
Love me like you wanted 
I can't keep your heart if your heart can't be kept satisfied 

So even if the walls crumble down 
Tumble down on me 
I could find my own way out 
I could set my own self free 

So tell me tell me what's the use 
I'm nothing but a singer with my head caught in the noose 
Somebody cut me loose 
Oh it's just as well 

I don't want no sympathy 
To feel a beating heart honey is what's ?? 
I know you don't agree 
Oh it's just as well 

And all I watned from you 
Love me like you wanted 
I can't keep your heart if your heart can't be kept satisfied 

All I wanted from you 
love me like you wanted 
I can't break your heart if your heart can't be kept satisfied

Jackie Greene,"Maybe its the way she lets her hair down on a sunday afternoon 
maybe its the way that she's romantically attracted to the moon 
maybe its the perfume that I know she doesn?t wear 
or maybe its the way she dances when she thinks there aint nobody there 

she loves me in the morning without warning before the sun begins to rise 
and in the evening i can tell her feelings just by looking in her eyes 
songbirds in the garden sing to her through frozen holidays 
and all my woe and trouble is gonna double when we go our seperate ways 

sugar, dandellion, honey, peach never did too much for me 
cause I aint no cassanova and no i never ever tried to be 
but something in her smile charms me like a child and then 
she turns the thieves and outlaws into nothing less than perfect gentlemen 

well the moon is in the mountains and the night is taking pictures of the sky 
and i've got nothing for you, nothing but this simple lullabye 
now should your mind forget me, regret me, or even do me wrong 
you?ll always live here in my heart cause baby thats right where you belong ",Love Song; 2: 00 Am
Jackie Greene,"So much depends on first loves and friends 
legs for a table 
and i painted my room 
with judgments and doom 
but i still ain't able to sleep 
got to sleep 
and dream up some dreams i can keep 
oh my, my marigold, marigold 

i was walking at dawn 
when something turned on 
but i couldn't name it 
so i, i went back home 
i did it alone 
but i couldn't claim it 
i tried, yes i tried 
i tried honey i was denied 
oh my, my marigold, marigold 

well everything becomes much more meaningless 
as time passes by 
so i hide in the bedorom with strong curtains drawn 
so i can't look the world in the eye 

i heard you were well 
i heard that you fell 
back on your feet 
well me, i'm still in fear 
i planted her here 
right in the street 
to sleep, so she sleeps 
and dreams with the orphans and freaks 
oh my, my marigold, marigold 

now talk, talk it is cheap 
i talk in my sleep 
i know what to say 
i said, i said you were wise 
to let go of my eyes 
and push me away 
and run, yes you run 
you run honey nothing gets done 
oh my, my marigold, marigold 

but all that i've learned it must be a chemical change 
after all i'm no different from the next twisted talker who's taking his lies to the grave 

i wasn't myself 
i was nobody else 
that i couldn't be 
like you were nobody too 
to somebody who's exactly like me

Jackie Greene,"Don't just stand there in the doorway
'Cause I hate to see you cry
And don't try to ignore me
Just smile and wave your hand goodbye

To you I'll send a dozen roses
From every town that I been in
And as long as leaves ain't falling
You'll know the shape that I been in

On the gray side of the mountain
You can hear my train roll by
Baby, I can be forgiven
But I'm never satisfied

Chase the rain out from your heart dear
'Cause I know you will survive
If I'm not living on the edge dear
Then I might not be alive

And in the winter of December
Turn your good side on the chill
And in the meantime please remember
I loved you then and I love you still

Out my window leaves are falling
And my train is passing by
Baby, I can be forgiven
But I'm never satisfied

he pays his rent but his life is just a pitty

Jackie Greene,"Cookie cried for three days, until she couldn?t cry no more 
she ate the fridge, jumped the bridge and wound up bloated on the shore 
The children they all pointed at another painted score 
and somebody asked: ?can I take a picture?? 

Well the heat down here is brutal, it?s hard to do what?s right 
the locals shout that you won?t burn out if you don?t ever shine too bright 
and I wish I was in your back pocket or in your bed tonight 
I wish that i was loud so you could hear me 

but oh, no 
what else must I be? 
it?s all inside my head I guess but it just reminds me 
that I need you, honey I need you 
there ain?t nobody who could supersede you 
we?re not such strangers, so honey I need you right now 

Now all the streets are paved with petals, the parade is coming through 
it kind of feels like royalty cause? everyone?s in blue 
and yellow flowers falling, from a window too 
falling to the feet of such a coward 

The mayor is kissing babies, he?s almost way too kind 
we?re filled to the brim with honest men, they?re just way too hard to find 
so stare into his Public Eyes and watch his clock unwind 
then find him old and drowning in the deep end 

but oh, now 
what else must I see? 
It?s all inside my head I guess but it just reminds me 
that I need you, honey I need you

You see, I long for a hickory morning with a waltz and trumpet flare 
i?m doing my best to recover from what time cannot repair 
and i?m sick of all this solitude and pre-rehearsed despair 
my eyes are a hundred miles away from sleeping 

Well I wish you?d write a letter, or telephone to me 
this place is dark and there ain?t a spark of who I used to be 
so the sick hearts of the unloved tell the brave souls of the sea: 
?we?re all closed up, why don?t you come back when we?re open.?

There?s a cracked and pale mirror, hanging on my wall 
the church bell rings and the choir sings and I can hear it from the hall 
Now you might not believe it, but there was no fire at all 
we just danced for seven days wishing for water 

Maria tells the fortunes, they line around the bend 
a dollar for your problems, and five to know the end 
They come from miles around; like a pack of howling men 
I wonder what she does with all that money 

but oh, now 
what else must i be? 
it?s all inside my head i guess, but it just reminds me 
that I need you, honey I need you 
there ain?t nobody who could supersede you 
we?re not such strangers, so honey I need you right now 

Simple sidewalk painter, says his life is such a bore 
spends his time with a jug of wine and a palette on the floor 
he screams: ?Heaven! Take my eyes, cause I can?t paint no more.? 
Honey, sometimes I feel just like his colors 

I?m gonna go down to the ocean, I want to fill my boots with sand 
so the next time that you see me, I?ll be a much more grounded man 
So go and do whatever it is you do and I?ll do what I can 
and when we meet again you can try to know me 

oh hey, 
what else must I be?

that babies are all born crying and dying is never free

But don't take my words as crudity
I've got a gentle soul
Deep beneath the bricks
And I, got to haul myself around it

By hounds and vultures, lean and unforgiving

Will not make a change, to how we're living

But I believe a change'll come for us, and those who demand it
For those who can't stand it
Living wild in the gutter
And on that day the sun will burn like golden hammer
And we will understand how and learn how, to live with each other

Jackie Greene,"He loved her back in 1961
He held her through the night
'Til the dark was gone

But he's been gone now for several years
Left her nothing but a letter to catch the tears
He might not know it but she had his son
Back in 1961

She raised the baby
And off to school he went
She had help from the neighbors
Along from the government

She tells herself that she did her best
Throughout all the trials, they had been blessed
But she still longs to have her fun
Like in 1961, oh

He wakes up on a lonely stretch of road
And driving rigs for a living
Truckin' a heavy load

His thoughts drift back to another time
And a woman that he treated so unkind
And wonders just what her life's become
Since 1961

He lays there now upon his dying bed
Memories of a lifetime's in his head

The nurse comes back, she says to him
""You have a visitor, should I let him in?""
And in walks a face that could only be his son

Speaking in shades of gray
I followed a man of no expression
I heard what he had to say

I saw the devils word
Some through the beaks of birds
The road was a winding silent serpent
Sweetest sound I ever heard

Time is moving slowly, thickening the sand

Time is yours if you want it, kill it
Spin it in the sand

But it's slipping from your hand

Well, life is made of a million moments
Catch one if you can
You try so hard but you never own it

I saw the ragged thief
The rock he was underneath
He spoke to the world of consequences
Crowds cried in disbelief

Eliminate your suffering

Run right 'round the world
Flash a hundred notes of green
Get yourself a girl

Looking like you're talking
The eagle laughs at you

Run around your office block
Tell me what to do
Regulating life by clock
That's a lie for you

But all the time you're standing there
Looking like you're talking
The eagle laughs at you
Just barely walking

There's nobody who has got enough money
To pay the entrance fee to paradise
And if you haven't got enough
Then you'll find it pretty rough

With a hundred servants clean
You will never do without

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Jackie McLean,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Jackie McLean,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up

What is the good of me by myself?

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But, honey, I can't live without it

Inhibited, insecure type of maid

Till a certain cutie told me I was swell
Now I'm smug and snooty
Confident as hell

I want to be no-one but me
I am in love with a lover who likes me the way I am
I have my faults, he likes my faults
I'm not very bright, he's not very bright
He thinks I'm grand, that's grand for me
He may be wrong, but if we get along 
What do we care say we
When he holds me close, close as we can be
I tell the lad that I'm grateful and I'm glad that
I'm nobody else but me

I have my faults, he likes my faults
I'm not very bright, he's not very bright
He thinks I'm grand, that's grand for me

Walking on the shore, swimming in the sea 
When I am with him, I'm glad that girl who's with him
Is nobody else but me

Jackie Paris,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Jackie Paris,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Jackie Paris,"You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your coin and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how lost I've been
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste the tears
They lose their taste for kissing

You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live yet never dies
Until you've faced the dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is",You Don't Know What Love Is

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Seeing images in the firelight

Jackie Paris,"Every time we say goodbye I die a little
Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little

I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange the change from major to minor

Comes the darkness and the frost, I get lost, I grow cold.

I grow cold, I grow weary, and I know I have sinned,
And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind,
And though I grope and I blunder and I kneel and I'm wrong,
Though the rose buckles under where I walk, walk along

Or that I can do it, pray, stay with me.

I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

So go downtown; things'll be great when you're

Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown

You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

Jackie Trent,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember",Goin' Back

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day

In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids

No football hero or smooth Don Juan

Can mean to a tired heart,
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray,

Near the end of a journey, too;

With colors that never fade,
And we find at the end of a perfect day

Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

I'll keep remembering forever and ever
I'll love you, dear, as long as I live

I haven't forgotten, I wonder if you have
Or if your heart is full of regret

As long as I live if it be one hour
Or it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever
I'll love you, dear, as long as I live

That life without you would be this bad

Jackie Wilson,"The first Noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee;
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.

Born is the King of Israel",The First Noel
Jackie Wilson,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay;
Remember Christ, our Savior,
Was born on Christmas day,
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Jewry,
This blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger,
Upon this blessed morn;
That which His Mother Mary,
Did nothing take in scorn.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

From God our Heavenly Father,
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

""Fear not,"" then said the Angel,
""let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding,
In tempest, storm, and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heav'n all gracious 
King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hast'ning on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heav'n and earth shall on the Prince of peace 
their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels 
sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings 
unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of 
wrong
And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring
O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

And not the words of one who kneels.

I took the blows 
And did it my way!",My Way

Jackie Wilson,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'N' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'N' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'N' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe

Angels were singing a hymn to your charms 
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low

The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on 
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime 
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

Jackie Wilson,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'N' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'N' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'N' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Bille Joe

Are separate entities like them, like you, like me

'Cause love is letting go of fear so let me fly up from the ground

For making a break with your cutting rake
Letting it drip into a pool

Jackopierce,"My baby don't love me anymore
She's tallied up the tickets and
She's laid out the score

My baby don't love me anymore
I used to come in the front entrance
Now I'm getting kicked out the back door

It seemed my summer was going fine
I was drinking dirty water but it tasted like good red wine
While the minutes and hours turned into days
But I found my hopes and principles
Wrapped up in an insecure tight haze

My baby don't love me anymore
She's tallied up the tickets and
She's laid out the score

My baby don't love me anymore
What used to be good loving
Turned into just another chore

And I find myself seeking shade
From the glow of insecurity but it still seemed to pervade
It seemed my lifetime had gone away now it seems that unsatisfactory
Is a place I'm gonna stay because my baby don't love me no more

And I've tried to see far in her mind
That she's my final glory day but maybe her decision
Matched with my disposition doesn't seem that she's no more
Comin' my way

'Cause my baby don't love me no more
She's tallied up the tickets and
She's laid out the score

My baby don't love me no more
What seemed like a string of nice notes
Turned into just an evil chord.

She pulled a pistol from her purse,
Screamed the party was over.

That he was leaving

But she wasn't letting on
That she was grieving

She's bound to go
Perhaps she'll find him waiting
For his boat in some city far away
She's bound to go

Lately I remember
Afternoons of smoke and wine
There was nothing we could find
But peace and pleasure
And with a smile he told me
That he wanted just to be on his way
Across the sea no man can measure

He won't be back
And the sun may find him sleeping
In the dust of some ruin far away
He won't be back

Early today as I watched while
The skyline was shaking
I heard a rumbling
Early today the mechanical city was waking
And I ran out stumbling, mumbling
Out through the laughter
Of children and dogs

Did you see our brother
He was here the other day
But he only came to say that
He can't breathe here
Did you see his lady
She was reaching for his hand
Just as if to tell her man
That she can't either

Help me find a way to fill
These empty hours
Say you will

On the rolling seas
She would stare across
The water from the trees
Last time he was home
He held her on his knees
And said, the next time
They would sail away
Just where they pleased

Help me find a way to fill
These lifeless sails
And stay until
My ships can find the sea

Jamaica was a sweet young one
I loved her true
She was a comfort
And a mercy through and through
Hiding from this world together
Next thing I knew
We had brought her things
Down to the bay, what could I do

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill
These sails
And we will sail until
Our waters have run dry",Jamaica Say You Will
Jackson Browne,"A lady stands before an open window
Staring so far away
She can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching her restless day

She turns from her window to me
Sad smile her apology
Sad eyes reaching to the door

Daylight loses to another evening
And still she spares me the word goodbye
And sits alone beside me fighting her feelings
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The sound of the words to speak her troubled mind
So I'm offering these to her as if to be kind
There's a train everyday leaving either way
There's a world, you know
There's a way to go
And you'll soon be gone, that's just as well
This is my opening farewell

A child's drawings left there on the table
And a woman's silk lying on the floor
And I would keep them here if I were able
Lock her safe behind this open door

But suddenly it's so clear to me
That I'd asked her to see what she may never see
And now my kind words find their way back to me
There's a train everyday leaving either way
There's a world, you know
You got a way's to go
And I'll soon believe, it's just as well
This is my opening farewell",My Opening Farewell
Jackson Browne,"The papers lie there helplessly
In a pile outside the door
I've tried and tried
But I just can't remember what they're for
The world outside is tugging
Like a beggar at my sleeve
Oh, that's much too old a story to believe

And you know that it's taken its share of me
Even though you take such good care of me
Now you say Morocco and that makes me smile
I haven't seen Morocco in a long, long while
The dreams are rolling down
Across the places in my mind
And I've just had a taste of something fine

The future hides and the past just slides
England lies between
Floating in a silver mist so cold and so clean
California's shaking like an angry child will
Who has asked for love and is unanswered still

And you know that I'm looking back carefully
'Cause I know that there's still
Something there for me
But you said Morocco and you made me smile
And it hasn't been that easy for a long, long while
And looking back into your eyes
I saw them really shine
Giving me a taste of something fine
Something fine

Now if you see Morocco I know you'll go in style
I may not see Morocco for a little while
But while you're there I was hoping
You might keep it in your mind
To save me just a taste of something fine",Something Fine
Jackson Browne,"Though Adam was a friend of mine
I did not know him well
He was alone into his distance
He was deep into his well
I could guess what he was laughing at
But I couldn't really tell
Now the story's told that Adam jumped
But I've been thinking that he fell

Together we went traveling
As we received the call
His destination India
And I had none at all
Well, I still remember laughing
With our backs against the wall
So free of fear, we never thought
That one of us might fall

I sit before my only candle
But it's so little light to find my way
Now this story unfolds before my candle
Which is shorter every hour
As it reaches for the day
But I feel just like a candle in the way
I guess I'll get there
But I wouldn't say for sure

When we parted we were laughing still
As our goodbyes were said
And I never heard from him again
As each our lives we led
Except for once in someone else's
Letter that I read
Until I heard the sudden word
That a friend of mine was dead

I sit before my only candle
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way
Now this journey appears before my candle
As a song that's growing fainter
The harder I play
That I fear before I end I'll fade away
But I guess I'll get there
Though I wouldn't say for sure

Though Adam was a friend of mine,
I did not know him long
And when I stood myself beside him,
I never though I was as strong
Still it seems he stopped his singing
In the middle of his song
Well I'm not the one to say I know
But I'm hoping he was wrong

I'm holding out my only candle
Though it's so little light to find my way
Now this story's been laid beneath my candle
And it's shorter every hour
As it reaches for the day
Yes, I feel just like a candle in the way
I hope I'll get there
But I never pray",Song for Adam
Jackson Browne,"Warm and lovely mystery
Fire smiling through
Before this moment fades away
I want to know you
I've got lightening in my pocket
Thunder in my shoe
Have no fear I've got something here
I want to show you

Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie
While I bring it to you

It's a low road, a high wire
Going from me to you
And in your eyes
The distance left is closing
I've got a feeling in my oceans
Blood underneath my skin
That into your bright fields
This prison is opening

Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie
While I bring it to you

Our shadows wake each day
Though they don't know why
They hope and try, live and die
So leave them in their frozen world
Come and be my lover
If only for one stolen moment
We will live forever
Forever

Warm and lovely mystery
Can you hear the choir
Voices can no longer hold my desire
Just abandon your sad history
And meet me in the fire
Our angels wait
To take us higher and higher
Higher and higher

Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie
While I bring it to you

Higher and higher",Under the Falling Sky
Jackson Browne,"Colors of the sun 
Flashing on the water top 
Echo on the land 

Picking for a coin 
Many other tiny worlds 
Singing past my hand 

Awake to understand you are not dreaming 
It is not seaming just to be this way 
Dying men draw numbers in the air 
Dream to conquer little bits of time 
Scuffle with the crowd to get their share 
And fall behind their little bits of time 

Voices in the air 
Sympathetic harmony 
Coming from the trees 

Hanging at my door 
Many shiny surfaces 
Clinging in the breeze 

Oh, leave me where I am I am not losing 
If I am choosing not to plan my life 
Disillusioned savior search the sky 
Wanting to just to show someone the way 
Asking all the people passing by 
Doesn't anybody want the way 

I say goodbye to Joseph and Maria 
They think I see another sky 
And from my fallen window I still see them 
I'll never free them from the sky",Colors of the Sun
Jackson Browne,"It is a dance we do in silence 
Far below this morning sun 
You in your life, me in mine 
We have begun 
Here we stand and without speaking 
Draw the water from the well 
And stare beyond the plains 
To where the mountains lie so still 

But it's a long way that I have come 
Across the sand to find this peace 
Among your people in the sun 
Where the families work the land 
As they have always done 
Oh it's so far the other way 
My country's gone 

Across my home has grown the shadow 
Of a cruel and senseless hand 
Though in some strong hearts 
The love and truth remain 
And it has taken me this distance 
And a woman's smile to learn 
That my heart remains among them 
And to them I must return 

But it's a long way that I have come 
Across the sand to find you here 
Among these people in the sun 
Where your children will be born 
You'll watch them as they run 
Oh it's so far the other way 
My life has gone 

If you look for me, Maria 
You will find me in the shade 
Wide awake or in a dream 
It's hard to tell
If you come to me, Maria 
I will show you what I've made 
It's a picture for our lady of the well",Our Lady of the Well
Jackson Browne,"In the time we've known
That we each are a part of one another
We've lost as much as we have won
And as our lives have grown
We have found that it only brings us pain
To hang on to the things that we have done
Still I love the times you've come

When you went away
Taking all that I'd built my false road on
I dropped my life and couldn't find the pieces
Now you come and go
And it's hard but I feel my strength returning
We'll see how far this new road reaches
We'll see a little more each time we come

Now everybody's gonna tell you it's not worth it
Everybody's gotta show you their own thing
You might try to find your way up around it
But the need for love will still remain

Now we're lying here
So safe in the ruins of our pleasures
Laughter marks the place where we have fallen
And our lives are near
So it wouldn't occur to us to wonder
Is this the past or the future that is calling

You know I've loved these times you've come.",The Times You've Come
Jackson Browne,"Everybody I talk to is ready to leave
With the light of the morning
They've seen the end coming down
Long enough to believe
That they've heard their last warning
Standing alone
Each has his own ticket in his hand
And as the evening descends
I sit thinking 'bout Everyman

Seems like I've always been
Looking for some other place
To get it together
Where with a few of my friends
I could give up the race
And maybe find something better
But all my fine dreams
Well though out schemes
To gain the motherland
Have all eventually come down
To waiting for Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand
Waiting here for Everyman
Don't ask me if he'll show, baby I don't know

Make it on your own if you think you can
Somewhere later on you'll have to take a stand
Then you're going to need a hand

Everybody's just waiting to hear from the one
Who can give them the answers
And lead them back to that place
In the warmth of the sun
Where sweet childhood still dances
Who'll come along
And hold out that strong
That gentle father's hand
Long ago I heard someone say
Something 'bout Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own
Make it  if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand

I'm not trying to tell you
That I've seen the plan
Turn and walk away if you think I am
But don't think too badly
Of one who's left holding sand
He's just another dreamer
Dreaming 'bout Everyman",For Everyman
Jackson Browne,"Some of them were dreamers
And some of them were fools
Who were making plans and thinking of the future
With the energy of the innocent
They were gathering the tools
They would need to make their journey back to nature
While the sand slipped through the opening
And their hands reached for the golden ring
With their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge
In the troubled years that came before the deluge

Some of them knew pleasure
And some of them knew pain
And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth
They went flying around in the rain
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered
And in the end they traded their tired wings
For the resignation that living brings
And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow
For the glitter and the rouge
And in a moment they were swept before the deluge

Let the music keep our spirits high
Let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky

Some of them were angry
At the way the earth was abused
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power
And they struggled to protect her from them
Only to be confused
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived
In the naked dawn only a few survived
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge

Let the music keep our spirits high
Let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by, by and by
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky",Before the Deluge
Jackson Browne,"In my early years i hid my tears
And passed my days alone
Adrift on an ocean of loneliness
My dreams like nets were thrown
To catch the love that I'd heard of
In books and films and songs
Now there's a world of illusion and fantasy
In the place where the real world belongs

Still i look for the beauty in songs
To fill my head and lead me on
Though my dreams have come up torn and empty
As many times as love has come and gone

To those gentle ones my memory runs
To the laughter we shared at the meals
I filled their kitchens and living rooms
With my schemes and my broken wheels
It was never clear how far or near
The gates to my citadel lay
They were cutting from stone some dreams of their own
But they listened to mine anyway

I'm not sure what i'm trying to say
It could be i've lost my way
Though i keep a watch over the distance
Heaven's no closer than it was yesterday

And the angels are older
They know not to wait up for the sun
They look over my shoulder
At the maps and the drawings of the journey I've begun

Now the distance leads me farther on
Though the reasons i once had are gone
I keep thinking I'll find what I'm looking for
In the sand beneath the dawn

But the angels are older
They can see that the sun's setting fast
They look over my shoulder
At the vision of paradise contained in the light of the past
And they lay down behind me
To sleep beside the road till the morning has come
Where they know they will find me
With my maps and my faith in the distance
Moving farther on",Farther On
Jackson Browne,"Keep a fire burning in your eye
Pay attention to the open sky
You never know what will be coming down
I don't remember losing track of you
You were always dancing in and out of view
I must've always thought you'd be around
Always keeping things real by playing the clown
Now you're nowhere to be found

I don't know what happens when people die
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try
It's like a song playing right in my ear
That I can't sing
I can't help listening

I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round
Crying as they ease you down
Cause I know that you'd rather we were dancing
Dancing our sorrow away
(Right on dancing)
No matter what fate chooses to play
(There's nothing you can do about it anyway)

Just do the steps that you've been shown
By everyone you've ever known
Until the dance becomes your very own
No matter how close to yours another's steps have grown
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone

Keep a fire for the human race
And let your prayers go drifting into space
You never know will be coming down

Perhaps a better world is drawing near
And just as easily, it could all disappear
Along with whatever meaning you might have found
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around
(The world keeps turning around and around)
Go on and make a joyful sound

Into a dancer you have grown
From a seed somebody else has thrown
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own
And somewhere between the time you arrive and the time you go
May lie a reason you were alive but you'll never know",For a Dancer
Jackson Browne,"Looking through some photographs I found inside a drawer
I was taken by a photograph of you
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more
But they didn't show your spirit quite as true

You were turning 'round to see who was behind you
And I took your childish laughter by surprise
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes

Now the things that I remember seem so distant and so small
Though it hasn't really been that long a time
What I was seeing wasn't what was happening at all
Although for a while, our path did seem to climb
When you see through love's illusions, there lies the danger
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger
While the loneliness seems to spring from your life
Like a fountain from a pool

Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight

Now for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams
But that magic feeling never seems to last
And while the future's there for anyone to change, still you know it seems
It would be easier sometimes to change the past
I'm just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you
In my lessons at love's pain and heartache school
Where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you
There's this loneliness springing up from your life
Like a fountain from a pool

Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight

You've had to hide sometimes but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight

Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to struggle, you've had to fight
To keep understanding and compassion in sight
You could be laughing at me, you've got the right
But you go on smiling so clear and so bright",Fountain of Sorrow
Jackson Browne,"Everyone I've ever known has wished me well
Anyway that's how it seems, it's hard to tell
Maybe people only ask you how you're doing
'Cause that's easier than letting on how little they could care
But when you know that you've got a real friend somewhere
Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear

Now to see things clear it's hard enough I know
While you're waiting for reality to show
Without dreaming of the perfect love
And holding it so far above
That if you stumbled onto someone real, you'd never know
(You'd never know)
You could be with somebody who is lonely too
(Sometimes it doesn't show)
He might be trying to get across to you
(Words can be so slow)
When your own emptiness is all that's getting through
There comes a point when you're not sure why you're still talking
I passed that point long ago
(Long ago)
Now I'm so tired of all this circling
And all these glimpses of the end
(You know it's useless to pretend)
That's all the voices say:


Click to learn more...
""You'll go right on circling
Until you've found some kind of friend""

I saw you through the laughter and the noise
You were talking with the soldiers and the boys
While they scuffled for your weary smiles
I thought of all the empty miles
And the years that I've spent looking for your eyes
(Looking for your eyes)
And now I'm sitting here wondering what to say
(that you might recognize)
Afraid that all these words might scare you away
(And break through the disguise)
No one ever talks about their feelings anyway
Without dressing them in dreams and laughter
I guess it's just too painful otherwise

Look
It's like you're standing in the window
Of a house nobody lives in
And I'm sitting in a car across the way
(Let's just say)
It's an early model chevrolet
(Let's just say)
It's a warm and windy day
You go and pack your sorrow
The trash man comes tomorrow
Leave it at the curb and we'll just roll away",The Late Show
Jackson Browne,"When we come to place where the road and the sky collide
Throw me over the edge and let my spirit glide
They told me I was going to have to work for a living
But all I want to do is ride
I don't care where we're going from here
Honey, you decide

Well I spend my time at the bottom of a wishing well
And I can hear my dreams singing clear as a bell
I used to know where they ended and the world began
But now it's getting hard to tell
I could be just around the corner from heaven or a mile from hell

I'm just rolling away from yesterday
Behind a wheel of a stolen Chevrolet
I'm going to get a little higher
And see if I can hot-wire reality

Now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead?
They're going to wash this planet clean like the bible said
Now you can hold on steady and try to be ready
But everybody's gonna get wet
Don't think it won't happen just because it hasn't happened yet

I'm just rolling away from yesterday
Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet
I'm going to get a little higher
And see if I can hot-wire reality",The Road and the Sky
Jackson Browne,"It's coming from so far away
It's hard to say for sure
Whether what I hear is music or the wind
Through an open door
There's a fire high in the empty sky
Where the sound meets the shore
There's a long distance loneliness
Rolling out over the desert floor

And the years that I spent lost in the mystery
Fall away leaving only the sound of the drum
Like a part of me
It speaks to the heart of me
Forget what life used to be
You are what you choose to be
It's whatever it is you see
That life will become

Whatever it is you might think you have
You have nothing to lose
Through every dead and living thing
Time runs like a fuse
And the fuse is burning
And the earth is turning

Though the years give way to uncertainty
And the fear of living for nothing strangles the will
There's a part of me
That speaks to the heart of me
Though sometimes it's hard to see
It's never far from me
Alive in eternity
That nothing can kill

Oh Lord
Are there really people starving still?
Look out beyond the walls of Babylon
How long will their needs go unfilled
I want to say right now I'm going to be around
I'm going to be around
When the walls and towers are crumbling
When the towers are tumbling down
And I will tune my spirit to the gentle sound
I want to hear the sound
Of the waters lapping on a higher ground
Of the children laughing",The Fuse
Jackson Browne,"Boy of mine
As your fortune comes to carry you down the line
And you watch as the changes unfold
And you sort among the stories you've been told
If some pieces of the picture are hard to find
And the answers to your questions are hard to hold

Take good care of your mother
When you're making up your mind
Should one thing or another take you from behind
Though the world may make you hard and wild
And determine how your life is styled
When you've come to feel that you're the only child
Take good care of your brother

Let the disappointments pass
Let the laughter fill your glass
Let your illusions last until they shatter
Whatever you might hope to find
Among the thoughts that crowd your mind
There won't be many that ever really matter

But take good care of your mother
And remember to be kind
When the pain of another will serve you to remind
That there are those who feel themselves exiled
On whom the fortune never smiled
And upon whose life the heartache has been piled
They're just looking for another

Jackson Browne,"Maybe the hardest thing I've ever done
Was to walk away from you
Leaving behind the life that we'd begun
I split myself in two

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
Rolling down that hill into the night
I could see the surprise and the hurt in your eyes
From behind each flashing city light

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If loves needs a heart like mine

Love won't come near me, she don't even hear me
She walks by my vacancy sign
Love needs a heart, trusting and blind
I wish that heart was mine

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
I'm afraid to believe the things I feel
I can cry with the best, I can laugh with the rest
But I'm never sure when it's real

And it may be the hardest thing I've ever done
But apart from all that I hope to find
Where's the heart that's been looking for mine?
I hope it finds me in time

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If love needs a heart like mine

They look at life with such disregard
They say it can't be won

The folks are home playing beat the clock
Down at the golden cup
They set the young ones up
Under the neon light

It's alright
Nobody rides for free
Nobody gets it like they want it to be
Nobody hands you any guarantee

Down on the boulevard the night's enough
And time passes slow
Between the store front shadows and the street lights glow
Everybody walks right by like they're safe or something
They don't know

I've come to see where my beginnings have gone 

Oh the walls and the windows were still standing 
And the music could be heard at the door 
Where the people who kindly endured my odd questions 
Asked if I came very far 
And when my silence replied they took me inside 
Where their children sat playing on the floor 

Well we spoke of the changes that would find us farther on 
And it left me so warm and so high 
But as I stepped back outside to the grey morning sun 
I heard that highway whisper and sigh 
Are you ready to fly? 

And I looked into the faces all passing by 
It's an ocean that will never be filled 
And the house that grows older and finally crumbles 
That even love cannot rebuild 
It's a hotel at best, you're here as a guest 
You oughta make yourself at home while you're waiting for the rest 

Well I looked into dream of the millions 
That one day the search will be through 
Now here I stand at the edge of my embattled illusions 
Looking into you 

The great song traveler passed through here 
And he opened my eyes to the view 
And I was among those who called him a prophet 
And I asked him what was true 
Until the distance had shown how the road remains alone 
Now I'm looking in my life for a truth that is my own 

Well I looked into the sky for my anthem 
And the words and the music came through 
But words and music can never touch the beauty that I've seen 
Looking into you -- and that's true",Looking into You
Jackson Browne,"Maybe the hardest thing I've ever done
Was to walk away from you
Leaving behind the life that we'd begun
I split myself in two

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
Rolling down that hill into the night
I could see the surprise and the hurt in your eyes
From behind each flashing city light

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If loves needs a heart like mine

Love won't come near me, she don't even hear me
She walks past my vacancy sign
Love needs a heart, trusting and blind
I wish that heart was mine

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
I'm afraid to believe the things I feel
I can cry with the best I can laugh with the rest
But I'm never sure when it's real
And it may be the hardest thing I've ever done
But apart from all that I hope to find
Where's the heart that's been looking for mine?
I hope it finds me in time

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If love needs a heart like mine",Love Needs a Heart
Jackson Browne,"Highways and dance halls
A good song takes you far
Your write about the moon
And you dream about the stars
Blues in old motel rooms
Girls in daddy's car
You sing about the nights
And you laugh about the scars
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons
You talk about the weather
And you grin about the rooms
Phone calls long distance
To tell how you've been
Forget about the losses, you exaggerate the wins

And when you stop to let em know
You've got it down
Its just another town along the road

The ladies come to see you
If your name still rings a bell
They give you damn near nothin
And they'll say they knew you well
So you tell em you'll remember
But they know its just a game
And along the way their faces
All begin to look the same
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the road

Well it isn't for the money
And its only for a while
You stalk about the rooms
And you roll away the miles
Gamblers in the neon, clinging to guitars
You're right about the moon
But you're wrong about the stars
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the way",The Road
Jackson Browne,"Oh people, look around you 
The signs are everywhere 
You've left it for somebody other than you 
To be the one to care 
You're lost inside your houses 
There's no time to find you now 
Your walls are burning 
And your towers are turning 
I'm going to leave you here 
And try to get down to the sea somehow 

The road is filled with homeless souls 
Every woman, child and man 
Who have no idea where they will go 
But they'll help you if they can 
Now everyone must have some thought 
That's going to pull them through somehow 
Well the fires are raging hotter and hotter 
But the sisters of the sun are going 
To rock me on the water now 

Rock me on the water 
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow 
Rock me on the water 
I'll get down to the sea somehow 

Oh people, look among you 
It's there your hope must lie 
There's a sea bird above you 
Gliding in one place like Jesus in the sky 
We all must do the best we can 
And then hang on to that Gospel plow 
When my life is over, I'm going 
To stand before the Father 
But the sisters of the sun are going 
To rock me on the water now 

Rock me on the water 
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow 
Rock me on the water, maybe I'll remember 
Maybe I'll remember how

Jackson Browne,"She was standing at the load-in
When the trucks rolled up
She was sniffin' all around
Like a half-grown female pup
She wasn't hard to talk to
Looked like she had nowhere to go
So I gave her a pass
So she could get in and see the show
Well, I sat her down right next to me
And I got her a beer
While I mixed that sound on the stage
So the band could hear
The more I watched her watch them play
The less I thought of to say
And when they walked off stage
You know, the drummer swept that girl away

But Rosie, you're all right
(You wear my ring)
When you hold me tight
(Rosie, that's my thing)
When you turn out the light
(I got to hand it to me)
Looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie

Well I guess I might have known from the start
She'd come for a star
Well I told my imagination not to run too far
Of all the times that I've been burned
By now you think I'd've learned
That it's who you look like,
Not who you are
(You all keep that in mind)

Rosie, you're all right

Jackson Browne,"When you look over your shoulder
And you see the life that you've left behind
When you think it over do you ever wonder? 
What it is that holds your life so close to mine

You love the thunder and you love the rain
What you see revealed within the anger is worth the pain
And before the lightning fades and you surrender
You've got a second to look at the dark side of the man

You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
And I know you wonder how you ever came
To be a woman in love with a man in search of the flame

Draw the shade and light the fire
For the night that holds you and calls your name
And just like your lover, knows your desire
And the crazy longing that time will never tame

You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
I got your number if it?s still the same
You can dream
But you can never go back the way you came

Jackson Browne,"Between the darkness on the street
And the houses filling up with light
Between the stillness in my heart
And the roar of the approaching night
Somebody's calling after somebody
Somebody turns the corner out of sight
Looking for somebody
Somewhere in the night
Tender is the night
Tender, when you hold your baby tight
Tender, tender are the motions, tender is the night
Between a life that we expected
And the way it's always been
I can't walk back in again
After the way we fight
When just outside there are people laughing
Living lives we used to lead
Chasing down the love they need
Somewhere in the night
Tender is the night
Tender, and the benediction of the neon light
Tender, tender are the hunters, tender is the night
You're gonna want me tonight
When you're ready to surrender
Forget about who's right
When you're ready to remember
It's another world at night
When you're ready to be tender
Tender, tender tender
Tender, tender tender
Tender

And in the hard light of an angry sun
No one remembers what was said or done
Tender are the words they choose
You win, I win, we lose
Tender
Tender is the night
Tender
The benediction of the neon light
Tender
Tender are the hunters
Tender is the night

Jackson Browne,"Papa hit him, Mama kissed him
Made him go to Catechism
With the sisters in their black and white
And all the time those city streets
Were teaching him another kind of wisdom
When to run and when to fight
Up at the playground after school
Listening to tales of the prison system
And those lawless avenues

Dawn on a half darkened street
A child's footsteps repeat
And something there turns them
Down those lawless avenues

Silent Joe went down so bad
He was the strongest fighter the avenues had
Stabbed in the chest he went down swinging
Someone from some other part of town
No one even seen it coming down
And you don't hear no church bells ringing
And in the violent night the police light
Sweeps across the lots and the yards
Following those lawless avenues

Down on a half darkened street
Armies advance and retreat
And struggle to take control
From those lawless avenues

Ran away with a surfer from Hermosa

Every boy die who could have gotten close to her

And you're seeing the human race
And the endless possibilities there
Where so much can come true
And you think of the beautiful things
A child can do

How long would the child survive
How long if it was up to you

When you think about the money spent
On defense by a government
And the weapons of destruction we've built
We're so sure that we need
And you think of the millions and millions 
That money could feed

How long can you hear someone crying
How long can you hear someone dying
Before you ask yourself why?
And how long will we hear people speaking
About missiles for peace
And just let it go by
How long will they tell us these weapons
Are keeping us free

With its green and its blue and white
The beauty of the curve of the earth
And its oceans below

How long can you hear someone dying
Before you ask yourself why?

Who gave the people a precious thing
He found a light in the darkest hour
And the strength for speaking truth to power

And in the years since they shot him down
You see changes that once were a dream
Begin to come around

When the walls have begun to crumble
When the laws have begun to burn
When the wind is singing freedom
When the stone begins to turn

And I come here to praise Mandela
And to bring this message to his jailer
Your walls may hold the man inside
But they'll never ever hold back the tide

'Cause in the years you've shut him away
A generation has grown where he stood
They're gonna see the day

When the walls have begun to crumble
When the laws have begun to burn
When the wind is singing freedom
When the stone begins to turn

We come here to sing for freedom
And to send our voices to the ones who need them
Freedom for South Africa
And justice for Nelson Mandela

Jackson Browne,"A man stands up before his God and country
Raises his right hand and takes an oath
Swears he has acted in the line of duty
And he more than anyone wants to tell the truth

But there is a need to keep somethings a secret
Some weapons shipments, some private wars
In the future democracy will be defended
Behind closed doors

Now the men of Congress who convene to determine
If covert war is a business or a crime
Are the same men who routinely give their permission
For the shedding of blood in security's name

And there is a need to keep some things a secret
The names of some countries, the terms of some deals
And above all the sound of the screams of the innocent
Beneath our wheels
Does the word justice mean anything to you?
Are the features of a lie beginning to come through?

In the streets of America the children are buried
Caught in an avalanche of weapons and drugs
They live and they die in the bowels of a business
That disguised as a war between The Crips and The Bloods

And there is a need to keep some things a secret
The C.I.A. deals protecting the source
And the government policies directly connecting the drugs and our wars
Does the word justice mean anything to you?
As the battlefield comes home and democracy falls through

I am waiting for the time to come
When the word will be real for everyone
And not just a word but a thing that can be done
Justice must be won

Oh, oh, oh justice

Oh, oh, oh justice

Of the lovers up and down the strand
In the sound of the waves and the cries
Of the seagulls circling the sand

In the fragments of the songs
Carried down the wind from some radio
In the murmuring of the city in the distance
Ominous and low

I hear the sound of the world where we played
And the far too simple beauty of the promises we made

If you ever need holding
Call my name, and I'll be there
If you ever need holding
And no holding back, I'll see you through

Where the touch of the lover ends
And the soul of the friend begins
There's a need to be separate and a need to be one
And a struggle neither wins

But you gave me the world I was in
And a place I could make a stand
I could never see how you doubted me
When I'd let go of your hand

Yeah, and I was much younger then
And I must have thought that I would know
If things were going to end

And the heavens were rolling
Like a wheel on a track
And our sky was unfolding
And it'll never fold back
Sky blue and black

And I'd have fought the world for you
(I'd have fought the world for you)
If I thought that you wanted me to
Or put aside what was true or untrue (true or untrue)
If I'd know that's what you needed
What you needed me to do

But the moment has passed by me now
You have put away my pride
And just come through for you somehow

If you ever need holding
Call my name, I'll be there
If you ever need holding
And no holding back, I'll see you through

You're the color of the sky
Reflected in each store-front window pane
You're the whispering and the sighing of my tires in the rain

You're the hidden cost and the thing that's lost
In everything I do
Yeah and I'll never stop looking for you

Those who have not, those who have

On the billboards and the t.v. screens
They got food and cars and toys and trucks and jeans
Like a homeless child's fitfull dreams
Smiling faces free from wanting
Life's abundances beyond counting

World in motion -- speed your changes
Close your distances, find your angels
Lose your fears and meet your dangers
World in motion

Once we were running through smoke and fire
Running into the sun
In the rush of youth, for love and truth
Our deeds were done
Now we awake with a world at stake
And a race we run
We run

Sun going down on the usa
Sun coming up a hundred years away
On another world and another time
Things like hunger, greed and hatred
One way or another, gonna be eradicated

World in motion -- speed your changes
Close your distances, drive your angels
Lose your fears and meet your dangers
World in motion

'till the world I look out at this world and see
Is the world I know this world can be
You have a volunteer in me
Now come on

Jackson Browne,"I want to live in the world, not inside my head
I want to live in the world, I want to stand and be counted
With the hopeful and the willing
With the open and the strong
With the voices in the darkness
Fashioning daylight out of song
And the millions of lovers
Alive in the world

I want to live in the world, not behind some wall
I want to live in the world, where I will hear if another voice should call
To the prisoner inside me
To the captive of my doubt
Who among his fantasies harbors the dream of breaking out
And taking his chances
Alive in the world

To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world

With its beauty and its cruelty
With its heartbreak and its joy
With it constantly giving birth to life and to forces that destroy
And the infinite power of change
Alive in the world

To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world

To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world",Alive in the World

When I was sixteen and on my own
No, I couldn't tell you what the hell those brakes were for
I was just trying to hear my song

Jimmy found his own sweet sound and won that free guitar
We'd all get in the van and play
Life became the paradox, the bear, the rouge et noir
And the stretch of road running to L.A.

Pages we were years from learning
Straight into the night our hearts were flung
Better bring your own redemption when you come
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from

The stars above and the lights below
Among those there to test their fortunes and their wills
I lost track of the score long ago

Like a fire in the cavernous darkness at the heart of the beast
With my beliefs and possessions, stopped at the frontier in my chest
At the edge of my country, my back to the sea, looking east

Where the search for the truth is conducted with a wink and a nod
And where power and position are equated with the grace of God
These times are famine for the soul while for the senses it's a feast
From the edge of my country, as far as you see, looking east

Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon
Hunger in the mansion, hunger in the rented room
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the laughing and the rage
In the absence of light
And the deepening night
Where I wait for the sun
Looking east

How long have I left my mind to the powers that be
How long will it take to find the higher power moving in me

Power in the insect
Power in the sea
Power in the snow falling silently
Power in the blossom
Power in the stone
Power in the song being sung alone
Power in the wheat field
Power in the rain
Power in the sunlight and the hurricane
Power in the silence
Power in the flame
Power in the sound of the lover's name
The power of the sunrise and the power of a prayer released
On the edge of my country, I pray for the ones with the least

Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon
Hunger in the banquet, hunger in the bride and groom
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the questions of the age
And an absence of light

In his own parade, leading the band
His head in the sky, his feet nearly touching the sand

That low road, day by day
And I just go on working for the things I need
And making my own way

Take a walk on the broken streets and the buildings falling down
Look at all these kids with nothing but trouble in their eyes
Trouble in their future, trouble in their lives

Some bridges are falling down
Some bridges are still around

Take a walk on the shaded uptown avenue
Some people are doing well no matter how they do
And I know there's more to life than what you own
But I see so many good things, things I've never known

Some bridges are falling down
Some bridges are still around

Every night I listen to the sound of the street
Lying in my bed
I love to see the dreams that are dancing there
In the light above your head
And sometimes I get so weary
And when hope is caving in
You fill me with your love and your laughter, baby
Until I get back up again

Carrying your smile with me
(Take a walk on the smoking edge of the battleground)

I'll go on home and lay my body down
And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again

We waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams
Of some greater awakening

They say in the end it's the wink of an eye
When the morning light comes streaming in
You'll get up and do it again

And the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring
And the junk man pounds his fender
Where the veterans dream of the fight
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait
For the ice cream vendor
Out into the cool of the evening
Strolls the Pretender
He knows that all his hopes and dreams
Begin and end there

Ah the laughter of the lovers
As they run through the night
Leaving nothing for the others
But to choose off and fight
And tear at the world with all their might
While the ships bearing their dreams
Sail out of sight

I'm gonna find myself a girl
Who can show me what laughter means
And we'll fill in the missing colors
In each other's paint by number dreams
And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strength is gone
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Get it up again

I'm gonna be a happy idiot
And struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie
In those things that money can buy
Thought true love could have been a contender
Are you there
Say a prayer for the Pretender
Who started out so young and strong
Only to surrender

It's been so hard sometimes to find my way
I let my pleasure lead my little world astray
And if I'm truthful I'll say that I was blind
To everything about this life but what I had in mind

And it was easy then to say where love could go

About my imagination, it got me through somehow
Without my imagination, I wouldn't be here now

And it was easy then when love was guaranteed
It's so easy when love is all you need

The beauty known only to me, and a big rig or two

With the trace of a smile and that defiant look in her eye
She hurtled through space in a world of her own
And turning aside my caress spoke of all that she'd not yet done
As if I was the doubting one who would have to be shown

If you'll just stand by me, and don't look back

And never stop coming up with all of that love for me
Never stop coming with your faith in what a love can be
Never stop coming up with all of that love
Keep on rising above
And never stop coming up on the world love wants to see

And the world has been showing you how
It's no place for your tender heart now
In a world that keeps turning you down
Only the heart knows where the strength can be found

Never stop coming up with all of that love for me
Never stop coming with your faith in what a love can be
Never stop coming up with all of that love
Keep on rising above
And never stop coming up on the world love wants to see

Remember when you look into my eyes
I'm the one who took you by surprise
The time has come and gone and come back 'round again
And I'm still here to take you by surprise my friend

Show me your eyes, tell me again
Where you want to go
Now the night is glowing beneath your skin
And when you smile I'm the richest man I know",Never Stop
Jackson Browne,"I used to lay out in a field under the Milky Way
With everything that I was feeling that I could not say
With every doubt and every sorrow that was in my way
Tearing around inside my head like it was there to stay

Night in my eyes, the night inside me
There where the shadows and the night could hide me
Night in my eyes
Sky full of stars turning over me
Waiting for night to set me free

I caught a ride into the city every chance I got
I wasn't sure there was a name for the life I sought
Now I'm a long way gone down the life I got
I don't know how I believed some of the things I thought

Night in my eyes, the night inside me
Here where the shadows gather to decide me
Night in my eyes
Out at the end of light and gravity
Waiting for night

It takes the night to clear all of this mess away
The obligation, the burden and the light of day
It takes the night to fall between the world I obey
And a world where I hear angels play
Maybe I should go back to Spain

I walk around inside the questions of my day
I navigate the inner reaches of my disarray
I pass the altars where fools and thieves hold sway
I wait for night to come and lift this dread away

Night in my eyes, the night inside me
Here where the shadows and the light divide me
Night in my eyes
Night full of promise and uncertainty
Waiting for night to set me free",The Night Inside Me
Jackson Browne,"He came 'round here with his camera and some of his American friends
Where the money is immortal and the killing never ends
He set out from CinecittÃ  through the ruined streets of Rome
To shoot in Almeria and bring the bodies home

He said
I'll be rich or I'll be dead
I've got it all here in my head

He could see the killers' faces and he heard the song they sang
Where he waited in the darkness with the Viale Glorioso gang
He could see the blood approaching and he knew what he would be
Since the days when he was first assisting The Force of Destiny

He worked for Walsh and Wyler with the chariot and sword
When he rode out in the desert he was quoting Hawks and Ford
He came to see the masters and he left with what he saw
What he stole from Kurosawa he bequeathed to Peckinpah

From the Via Tuscolana to the view from Miller Drive
He shot the eyes of bad men and kept their deaths alive
With the darkness and the anguish of a Goya or Van Cleef
He rescued truth from beauty and meaning from belief",Sergio Leone
Jackson Browne,"One foot after the other
One place pretty much like another
Some folks got a pretty good deal
Some are just looking for their next meal
Out here where the days go by
And the glances never meet the eye
It's a walking town
And I'm just out here walking 'round
Walking 'round this walking town

You got a house on top of a hill
And a powerful automobile
The windows up, the AC high
In a world of comfort speeding by
Stressed out in the latest style
How long has it been since you walked a mile
In yours or anybody else's shoes
Well, in any life there will be dues
It's a walking town
And I'm just out here walking 'round
Walking 'round this walking town

Walking up, walking down
Walking back, walking 'round
Walking mute, walking bound
Walking through your walking town

One foot on the concrete shore
One foot in the human sea
Night falls on the streets of the city
And it falls over you and me
And all our dreams and our descriptions
Of the life this was supposed to be
Drift above the rooftops and the houses
Until the sunlight finds me where I lay
And it's a walking town
And I'm back out here walking 'round

I look around my life tonight and you are gone
I might have done something to keep you if I'd known
How unhappy you had become

While I was dreaming of you
With my heart in your hands
And I was following through
With my beautiful plans

Yeah now I'm rolling down this canyon drive
With your laughter in my head
I'm gonna have to block it out somehow to survive
'Cause those dreams are dead
And I'm alive

I want to go where I will never hear your name
I want to lose my sorrow and be free again
And I know I've been insane
When I think of places I could have been

But I was dreaming of you
With my heart in your hands
And I was following through
With my beautiful plans

Standing here by the highway side
Watching these trucks blow by
Inches from my face
Yeah thinking 'bout the time I've wasted
And the pleasure we once tasted
Looking up and down this road
(Following through)
I've been here before (following through)
I can't be here no more (following through)

Yeah now I'm rolling down California five
With your laughter in my head
I'm gonna have to block it out somehow to survive
'Cause those dreams are dead
I'm alive
Yeah baby I'm alive
Yeah, I'm alive

Hey look at the way I believed in you
And loved you all these years
Now you can fill a swimming pool with all my salty tears
If you'd have told me what was in your heart
But baby you lied
And I thought that it would kill me
But I'm alive

Jackson Browne,"Jamaica was the lovely one
I played her well
As we lay in the tall grass
Where the shadows fell
Hiding from the children
So they would not tell
We would stay there
'Til her sister rang
The evening bell

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill
These empty hours
Say you will
Come again tomorrow

The daughter of a captain
On the rolling seas
She would stare across
The water from the trees
Last time he was home
He held her on his knees
And said, the next time
They would sail away
Just where they pleased

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill
These lifeless sails
And stay until
My ships can find the sea

Jamaica was a sweet young one
I loved her true
She was a comfort
And a mercy through and through
Hiding from this world together
Next thing I knew
We had brought her things
Down to the bay, what could I do

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill
These sails
And we will sail until
Our waters have run dry","Jamaica, Say You Will"

Just when I was getting over you
Just when I was going to make it through
Another night without missing you
Thinking I might just be strong enough after all
When I hear your footsteps echoing in the hall
Baby here we stand again
Like we've been so many times before
Even though you looked so sure
As I was watching you walking out my door
But you always walk back in like you did today
Acting like you never even went away
Well I don't know if I can
Open up and let you in baby
Here come those tears
Here come those tears again
I can hear you telling me
How you needed to be free
And you had some things to work out alone
Now you're standing here telling me
How you have grown
Here come those tears again
Now you'll tell me how to hold them in
Here come those tears
Here come those tears again

When I can look at you without crying
You might look like a friend of mine
But I don't know if I can

Jackson Browne,"Oh how sadly sound the songs the queen must sing of dying
A prisoner upon her throne of melancholy sighing
If she could see her mirror now
She would be free of those who bow and
Scrape the ground before her feet

Silently she walks among her dying midnight roses
Watches as each moment goes that never really know us
And so it seems she doesn't care
If she has dreams of no one there
Within the shadows of her room

But all my frozen words agree, and say it's time to
Call back, all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen
Inside these empty halls

Wooden lady turn and turn among my weary secrets
And wave within the hours past and other empty pockets
Maybe we've found what we have lost
When we've unwound so many crossed entangling
Misunderstandings; but

All my frozen words agree and say it's time to
Call back all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen
Inside these empty walls",The Birds of St. Marks [#]

These days I seem to think a lot 
About the things that I forgot to do 
For you 
And all the times I had the chance to 

And I had a lover 
It's so hard to risk another these days 
These days,
Now if I seem to be afraid 
To live the life I have made in song 
Well it's just that I've been losing so long 

I'll keep on moving

These days I sit on corner stones 
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend

When I was sixteen and on my own
No, I couldn't tell you what the hell those brakes were for
I was just trying to hear my song

We'd all get in the van and play
Life became the paradox, the bear, the rouge et noir
And the stretch of road running to l.a.

Pages turning
Pages we were years from learning
Straight into the night our hearts were flung
Better bring your own redemption when you come
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from

The stars above and the lights below
Among those there to test their fortunes and their wills

Jackson Browne,"Everybody I talk to is ready to leave
With the light of the morning
They've seen the end coming down
Long enough to believe
That they've heard their last warning
Standing alone
Each has his own ticket in his hand
And as the evening descends
I sit thinking 'bout Everyman

Seems like I've always been
Looking for some other place
To get it together
Where with a few of my friends
I could give up the race
And maybe find something better
But all my fine dreams
Well though out schemes
To gain the motherland
Have all eventually come down
To waiting for Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand
Waiting here for Everyman
Don't ask me if he'll show, baby I don't know

Make it on your own if you think you can
Somewhere later on you'll have to take a stand
Then you're going to need a hand

Everybody's just waiting to hear from the one
Who can give them the answers
And lead them back to that place
In the warmth of the sun
Where sweet childhood still dances
Who'll come along
And hold out that strong
That gentle father's hand
Long ago I heard someone say
Something 'bout Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own
Make it  if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand

I'm not trying to tell you
That I've seen the plan

Of one who's left holding sand
He's just another dreamer

Jackson Browne,"Standing in the ocean with the sun burning low in the west
Like a fire in the cavernous darkness at the heart of the beast
With my beliefs and possessions, stopped at the frontier in my chest
At the edge of my country, my back to the sea, looking east

Where the search for the truth is conducted with a wink and a nod
And where power and position are equated with the grace of God
These times are famine for the soul while for the senses it's a feast
From the edge of my country, as far as you see, looking east

Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon
Hunger in the mansion, hunger in the rented room
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the laughing and the rage
In the absence of light
And the deepening night
Where I wait for the sun
Looking east

How long have I left my mind to the powers that be?
How long will it take to find the higher power moving in me?

Power in the insect
Power in the sea
Power in the snow falling silently
Power in the blossom
Power in the stone
Power in the song being sung alone
Power in the wheat field
Power in the rain
Power in the sunlight and the hurricane
Power in the silence
Power in the flame
Power in the sound of the lover's name
The power of the sunrise and the power of a prayer released
On the edge of my country, I pray for the ones with the least

Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon
Hunger in the banquet, hunger in the bride and groom
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the questions of the age
And an absence of light
In the deepening night
Where I wait for the sun

In the shade of the freeway
Gonna pack my lunch in the morning

I'll go on home and lay my body down
And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again
Amen.
Say it again
Amen.

I want to know what became of the changes
We waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams
Of some greater awakening?
I've been aware of the time going by
They say in the end it's the wink of an eye
When the morning light comes streaming in
You'll get up and do it again
Amen.

Caught between the longing for love
And the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring
And the junk man pounds his fender.
Where the veterans dream of the fight
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait
For the ice cream vendor
Out into the cool of the evening
Strolls the Pretender
He knows that all his hopes and dreams
Begin and end there

Ah the laughter of the lovers
As they run through the night
Leaving nothing for the others
But to choose off and fight
And tear at the world with all their might
While the ships bearing their dreams
Sail out of sight

I'm gonna find myself a girl
Who can show me what laughter means
And we'll fill in the missing colors
In each other's paint-by-number dreams
And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strength is gone
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Get it up again

I'm gonna be a happy idiot
And struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie 
In those things that money can buy
Thought true love could have been a contender
Are you there?
Say a prayer for the Pretender.
Who started out so young and strong
Only to surrender.

Are you prepared for the pretender?",The Pretender [Live]

Who gets to no bid contract the future?
Who lies, then bombs, then calls it an error?
Who makes a fortune from fighting terror?

Who is the enemy of peace and freedom?

Jackson Browne,"I went to the live nude cabaret
To see what I could see
And I saw the ladies dancing
An I guess that they saw me
Neither did I vanquish, or surrender to desire
Was just more fuel on the fire

I?ve heard form follows function
And I think that must be true
Especially when you think of
What the female form will do
Its lines and shapes are everywhere
As if they follow me
Repeating my own longing in everything I see

Star of happiness, star of love
Lead us to the shore
That only women hold the promise of
Men would give them money
And men would give them gold
And shower them with promises
Of luxury untold
And make their vessels of creation
The temples of our souls
Ohhhhh let my people go

Sea of loneliness, sea of love
Carry me upon your endless depths
And bear my heart above
For I would give her money
And I would give her jewelry
And lead her to the palace my imagination rules
And fashion from her nakedness
The innocence that?s gone
Gone as the time she?s given the suffering of fools

Jackson Browne,"Where Were You

Where were you when the sky cracked open
Waiting for shelter and barely coping
Thinking you could ride the storm out 
Hoping you would be all right
Where were you when they gave a warning
Hundred-fifty mile winds by morning
Category four making landfall in the wild gray light 
Where were you
Where were you

Where were you in the social order
Lower nine or a hotel in the Quarter
Which side of the Quarter between rich and poor?
Where were you gonna evacuate to
Assuming there was any way to
Where if you didn?t own a car?
Where were you
Where were you

Where were you when you understood
However decent, however good
However hard some people try
They only barely make it by
They?re born to live their entire lives 
In harm?s way

Where were you when you heard the stranded
The injured and the empty-handed
Running out of food and water at the Superdome
The newborn and the elderly
Exposed to even more misery
While those in charge of rescue 
Waited for the Guard to come
And those who left the Convention Center
Were stopped on the bridge when they tried to enter
The safety of the Westbank and higher ground?


And when the Guard finally did arrive
And got to work on about day five
Mainly they were used to keep the looting down?
Where were you
Where were you

Where were you when you realized
However strong, however wise
However true our leaders appear to be
They talk about prosperity
However hard this country strives
When property is valued more than lives
How strong will we ever really be
How long do we imagine we?ll be free

We hold the truth self evident
The photograph of the President
From Air Force One he viewed the devastation
Shaved face and rested eyes
Looking down he circles twice
On the way home from his vacation
Where were you
When you got the picture
Where were you
Where were you when the streets filled up with black water
Where were you when defeat and destruction reigned in the Crescent
Where were you when it blew from every direction
Where were you when the promise was made
To retrurn and rebuild
To restore to its people
The city that gave us the first American music
The true inspiration and the freedom to use it
Where will we find it again if we lose it
And where will we be
If we ever cease to love
If we ever cease to love

Where Were You

Jackson Browne,"If I had money tell you what I'd do
I'd go downtown and buy a Mercury or two
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury, I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road

The girl I love, I stole it from a friend
He got lucky stole her back again
Cause she knew he had a Mercury, she knew he had a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road

Hey now mama you look so fine
Ridin' round in your Mercury 49
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury, I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road

My baby went out she didn't stay long
She bought herself a Mercury, came a cruisin' home
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury, I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road

Jackson Browne,"Oh how sadly sound the songs the queen must sing of dying
A prisoner upon her throne of melancholy sighing
If she could see her mirror now
She would be free of those who bow and
Scrape the ground before her feet

Silently she walks among her dying midnight roses
Watches as each moment goes that never really know us
And so it seems she doesn't care
If she has dreams of no one there
Within the shadows of her room

But all my frozen words agree, and say it's time to
Call back, all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen
Inside these empty halls

Wooden lady turn and turn among my weary secrets
And wave within the hours past and other empty pockets
Maybe we've found what we have lost
When we've unwound so many crossed entangling
Misunderstandings; but

All my frozen words agree and say it's time to
Call back all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen
Inside these empty walls",The Birds of St. Marks
Jackson Browne,"Ever since the world's existed
There's one thing that is certain
There are those who build walls
And those who open doors
Ah but this my love I'm thinking you already knew

For some it's always winter
While others have the spring
Some people find good fortune
While others never find a thing
Ah but this my love is something you already knew

That's how it's always been
And I know you know it
There can be freedom only when nobody owns it
I'm going to say that again
Because I know you know it
There can be freedom only when nobody owns it

Of what use is the moon if you don't have the night?
Of what use is a windmill with no Quixote left who'll fight?
Ah but this my love is something you already knew
At some point on the horizon
Sky can be confused with earth
Some people dream of God
While others dream of wealth
But of course my love this is what you see out on the street

It's how it's always been
And I know you know it
There can be freedom only when nobody owns it
Let me say that again
Because I know that we both know it
There can be freedom only when nobody owns it
When nobody owns it
When nobody owns it

Ever since the world's existed
There's one thing that is certain
Some people build walls",Walls and Doors
Jackson Browne,"Well you know I don't need you
And I don't feed you no lies

And it's not up to me to tell you
What you see through your eyes

Where it is you still think you can go

That time that I met you
There's something that set you apart

And were out here in this world on our own
And it's too late to go back
And it's too late to leave me alone
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)

Cause you paid for the love that we got
You paid
Yeah, yeah
And you made for the heart to be fought

Was it strength or your pride
That sent you back inside

You know I don't need you
And I don't feed you no lies
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Maybe I didn't come with instructions like some other guy
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
You see me standing at the window
With my world at my back
And my eyes down the road
Staring at the wreckage of a lifetime strewn along the track
And the seeds that were sowed
You think I'm wishing I was some other place
But in fact I'm right here
And my shoulder to lean on baby
And my heart in with you
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)

And you can see that it's not always easy
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Maybe that makes you crazy
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
But can you see that I've spent all I had
That you go on making me glad
That I found your love in this world after times were so bad

Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)

And you paid for the love that we got
You paid
Yeah yeah
And you made for the heart when we fought
And you stayed

Jackson Garrett,"There's something happening here 
What it is ain't exactly clear 
There's a man with a gun over there 
Telling me I got to beware 

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

There's battle lines being drawn 
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong 
Young people speaking their minds 
Getting so much resistance from behind 

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

What a field-day for the heat 
A thousand people in the street 
Singing songs and carrying signs 
Mostly say, hooray for our side 

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Paranoia strikes deep 
Into your life it will creep 
It starts when you're always afraid 
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top

I don't ever want to leave this town

That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

I'll be the first to say that I was wrong

I hope he holds your hand

Sunrise cuts the darkness
Steps and stares with well worn warning
Touch down, a perfect landing
Missing but he's still standing, barely

English sunset, sun in your eyes
Dusk sweeps over us tonight
Rainy Brixton holidays
Red brick parks and alleyways
Lion's Roar silenced and still
A test of strength, test of our will, waiting

I'll aim right for you (repeat)
A waiting van, a passing phase
Phone calls from you to pass the days
From caffeine highs to midnight lows
Punch drunk heartache blow by blow
I'll wait for you in hotel rooms
In rain soaked days we pass the gloom
The Northern Star tonight will set the course

English sunset, sweet goodbyes
The wind is in our sails tonight
Rainy Brixton memories
I pull myself closer to me
The Lion's Roar in vain tonight
A distant call, a distant light, someday

To the things I think will satisfy me

I will give you everything you need in time
And I will love you more you see, right now

Is it even true that there's good somewhere inside of me?
If I try my best it's still not enough
But tryin' only ever goes so far and in the end I feel the same
And the good I want only ends in shame

Will someone say, yeah, yeah, I'll be there?

I will give you everything you need in time

Asleep at night i still call out your name.
As the storm clouds beat a cold refrain
Against my window pane.

But an autumn moon it calls to me.
Like a tide tongues round an island,
How your naked soul it calls to me.
I come to you in silence.
I sing to you with breath alone.

Or maybe passion's slaves gone overboard.

Let me dream with you in sleepless love.
Let me dream with you in sleepless love.

The midnight air enfolds us
As silken shadows glide in sweet caress.
And nature's hand controls us.
So let us drink the wine of carelessness
If cosmic fates entomb us
Let the fires burn from well within
And from hunger's pool consume us.
Let the perfect nameless dance begin.

Let me dream with you in sleepless love.
Let me dream with you
Let me dream with you
Let me dream with you in sleepless love.

Here in the darkness
Isn't where the passion ever starts.
We float together,
The deepest hungers happening in the heart.

The midnight sky is starless
But an autumn moon it calls to me.
Like a tide tongues round an island,
How your naked soul it calls to me.
I come to you in silence.
I sing to you with breath alone.
We'll be each other's tyrants
Or maybe passion's slaves gone overboard.

Jacky Terrasson,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

Jacky Terrasson,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Were we on the Nile?
Long, long ago,
Say an hour or so
I recall that I saw your smile.


I remember you,
You're the one who made
My dreams come true
A few kisses ago.


I remember you, 
You're the one who said
""I love you, too,"" I do.
Didn't you know?


I remember, too, 
A distant bell,
And stars that fell like rain
Out of the blue.

And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all,
Then I shall tell them
I remember you.

Jacky Terrasson,"If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no! not in spring-time.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you at all.

No, never could I leave you at all.",If Ever I Would Leave You
Jacky Terrasson,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, I'm as jumpy as
puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale
without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring
I keep I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to
meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning
daydreams
I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be
spring
It might as well be spring.",It Might as Well Be Spring
Jacky Terrasson,"Little boy lost in search of little boy found
You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it? 
Little boy blue, don't let your little sheep roam
It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home?

Jacky Terrasson,"I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins witching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the sky
It's that old devil moon deep in your eyes

You and your glance makes this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon deep in your eyes

Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old evil moon deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love!!

So I have invented my own.
Darling, this place is lovely oasis
Where life's weary taste is unknown

Far from the crowded city
Where flowers pretty caress the stream

Don't let it apart in my dream

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

I've walked for miles and miles in a dead man's shoes

Jackyl,"Trailer park trash
That's what I am
You don't like my ways
I don't give a damn
And I feel no need to change my stride
When you ain't got nothing there's nothing to hide

And no!
I don't have nothing better to do
And yea!
I've walked through better men than you
So before you try to change my ways
All the junk can go, but this yard dog stays

Back down in the dirt
Back down in the dirt
Where I'm supposed to be
And it's getting good to me
Back down in the dirt
Back down in the dirt
Where I'm supposed to be
And it's getting to me

Never get a leg up
Keep my feet on the ground
If you're looking for trouble
Then it's trouble you've found
Don't take no schooling to educate me
I'm all the man that I need to be

Yea!
It's easy to see where I stand
I got my bird in the hand
So make sure that you're ready to clash
Don't you write a check that your ass can't cash

Jackyl,"Big Orange rolled into Boston headed straight for Chinatown
To find the native restless and see what's going down
We hit the streets a walking, checked out a rated X
It was all about a woman and a donkey named Rex

Get me out of Chinatown
I don't like what's going down
So get me out of Chinatown

See the big man dressed in ladies clothes, he looks really rude
I guess he forgot to look at himself when he was in the nude
Jeff and Jimmy had to laugh when the he/she lost his hair
Rolled up in the Cadillac's window that left him standing there

I yearn to touch you late at night

I could build a building straight up to the sky
But you can take me higher, here's the reason why

I could never touch you
I could never touch you like you do
I could never touch you
No matter how much I really wanted to
I could never touch you
Like you do
I could never touch you
I could never touch you like you do

The overflow of love keeps flowing
More than any man could ever want
I can swim forever in your garden lake
The magic in your hand, it takes your magic for the dam to break

And I would crawl across burning desert sand
Just to have the voodoo that's in your hand

I can feel your heart beat next to mine

I promise we'll make some classic rock history

It's the American way I had to make it my own break

This is my life and I'm down to my soul
This is my life, this is my rock and roll
This is my life and I've taken control of me

You dug the hole now it's broken your back
Now take a good look at me, look at my face

I do not fear the things I feared before
You had control but I wanted it more than you

And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness

You're pulling me down
And you're pulling me down

Of feeling pretty numb as I start to think
Of all the things that I wish
That I could change and then some
And the numbness turns into pain
And underneath there shows a stain
I try my best to try and hide the things
That eat me up inside

Jackyl,"All right people, step right up
Don't be afraid to throw that change
Me and my buddy gonna play you a tune
Goes something like this

I got a friend that lives in the city, in New York City
Puts a brown bag under his arm
Walks down the street till he gets into a big box
Crawls inside and has a sea,t in a cardboard box
In the city, New York City stop

Two, three, four
He always finds the cheap wine
Its liquid heat but it makes a meal
Finally takes a drink and he shakes his head
No, life's not pretty in the city, New York City

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, 'Hey mister, can you spare a dime?'

Well, I'm standing on the edge of insanity
Looking over the edge
Things look greener on the other side
Sit around and worry about things
Wonder why, till I literally breakdown and cry

And it seems as though I've reached out
And slapped the world on the balls
Grabbed it by the throat
Slammed it up against the wall

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, 'Hey mister, can you spare a dime?'

Take it on back to Georgia boys, yeah
Mr Worley

So if you're looking down on me
Don't like what you see
I've been around a time or two
And I'll make a fool of you

And so what if I reached out
And slapped the world on the balls
Grab me by the throat
And slam me up against the wall

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, hey mister, hey mister

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, 'Hey mister, hHey mister, hey mister, can you spare a dime'
Give it up

And all my worries and troubles, they just seem to fade behind

Oh the secret of the bottle it may never be known
So I'll raise my glass and propose a toast and this one baby is for you

I start to laugh when I'm drinking, I may tell a joke or two
Sometimes I'll even pretend that I'm still in love with you

And you ask me if I've felt pain
After all that I've been through
I've paid more than just my dues

They was out to meet the boys in the band

Why he even bothers to open the door

They run deep in to show that you can never replace
All the years go by and the place that he's found
They say the shit is coming through
He said build it up around
Wonder how he managed to stay
In an old empty building
He makes it ok

Everybody heard that word
That they named it after Bird
Where the rythym swooped and swirled
The jazz corner of the world
And the cats they gigged in there
Were beyond compare

Birdland, I'm singing Birdland
Birdland, old swingin' Birdland

Hey man, the music really turns you on
Really? Ya turn me around and turn me on

Down them stairs, lose them cares
Where? Down in Birdland
Total swing, Bop was king there
Down in Birdland
Bird would cook, Max would look
Where? Down in Birdland
Miles came through, trane came too there
Down in Birdland
Basie blew, Blakie too
Where? Down in Birdland
Cannonball played that hall there
Down in Birdland, yeah

There will never be nothin' such as that
No more, skoo be wah, no more
Down in Birdland, that's where it was at
I know, ah ah ah ah ah, I know
Back in them days Bop was ridin' high
Hello, heh heh heh heh heh, goodbye!

How well those cats remember their first Birdland gig
To play in Birdland is an honor we still dig
Yeah, that club was like in another world
Sure enough, yeah baby
All those cats were cookin' on
People just sat and they were steady lookin' on
Then Bird, he came and spread the word
Birdland

Yes indeed he did
Yes indeed he did
Yes indeed he did
Yes he did Parker played in Birdland
Yes he really did
Yes indeed he really did told the truth way down in Birdland
Yes indeed he did, Yard bird Parker played in Birdland
Yes indeed he really did, Charlie Parker played in Birdland

Bird named it, Bird made it
Bird heard it, then played it
Well stated Birdland
It happened down in Birdland

Everybody dug that beat
Everybody stomped their feet
Everybody digs be bop
And they'll never stop

Down them stairs, lose them cares

Jaco Pastorius,"I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shocked love away

There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today

In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed

I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line

Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen...strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through' the snow and the pinewood trees

I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones

I know, no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality, to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality

In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years

We're only particles of change I know, I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone

White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way",Hejira
Jaco Pastorius,"There was a moon and a street lamp
I didn't know I drank such a lot
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda
The full length of the parking lot!
Oh, I talk too loose
Again I talk too open and free
I pay a high price for my open talking
Like you do for your silent mystery

Come and talk to me
Please talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Mr. Mystery

We could talk about Martha
We could talk about landscapes
I'm not above gossip
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!
Or we could talk about power
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies
Or Bergman's nordic blues
Please just talk to me
Any old theme you choose
Just come and talk to me
Mr. Mystery, talk to me

You could talk like a fool-I'd listen
You could talk like a sage
Anyway the best of my mind
All goes down on the strings and the page
That mind picks up all these pictures
It still gets my feet up to dance
Even though it's covered with keyloids
From the ""slings and arrows of outrageous romance""
I stole that from Willy the Shake!
You know, ""Neither a borrower nor a lender be""
Romeo, Romeo talk to me!

Is your silence that golden?
Are you comfortable in it?
Is it the key to your freedom
Or is it the bars on your prison?
Are you gagged by your ribbons?
Are you really exclusive or just miserly?
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!
Come and spend some on me,
Shut me up and talk to me!
I'm always talking!
Chicken squawking!
Please talk to me",Talk to Me
Jaco Pastorius,"I'm down to a roll of dimes
I'm stalking the slot that's hot
I keep hearing bells all around me
Jingling in the lucky jackpots
They keep you tantalized
They keep you reaching for your wallet
Here in fools' paradise!

I talked to a cat from Des Moines
He said he ran a cleaning plant
That cat was clanking with coin
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
'Cause every time, I dropped a dime, I blew it
He kept ringing bells
Nothing to it!

He got three oranges
Three lemons
Three cherries
Three plums
I'm losing my taste for fruit
Watching the dry cleaner do it
Like Midas in a polyester suit
It's all luck!
It's just luck!
You get a little lucky and you make a little money!

I followed him down the strip
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus
Where the cowgirls fill the room
With their big balloons
The Cleaner was pitching with purpose!
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears
And lions, pink and blue there
He couldn't lose there!

Des Moines was stacking the chips
Raking off the tables
Ringing the bandit's bells
This is a story that's a drag to tell
(In some ways)
Since I lost every dime
I laid on the line
But the cleaner from Des Moines
Could put a coin
In the door of a John
And get twenty for one
It's just luck!",The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines
Jaco Pastorius,"I packed my bags - in the land of rags
'Cause I don't believe in them dimmo drags
Don't want to vote for the left wing - don't want to vote for the right
I gotta have both-to make me fly

Just a whitey from Blighty - heading out west
Got my little green card an' my bulletproof vest
Goin' to old tube city - where the buzz is the best
On down the line (down the line) down the line (down the line)

Well I was born (on the line) an' I was raised (on the line)
I was schooled (on the line) an' I was fazed (on the line)
An' I was used (on the line) an' I was dazed (on the line)

Let's make some noise tonight
I'll be a seed for to sew
I'll sing you arias on pirate radio

In through your front door
Up the staircase to your room
I'll be the needle in your groove
I'll shake your mattress till you
See me down below

If you hold my hair back
When the world gets overwhelming
I will hold your hair back

Let's make some noise tonight
Let's burn in mama's bright red little lamp
The sound and fury we compose
A baby tiger in the throws

And if you don't love me
You’ll be a kamikaze flying circles
Around my heart and when my guard
Is down you'll tear my ship apart

If you hold my hair back
When the world gets overwhelming
I will hold your hair back

Please, please, please

Let's make some noise tonight
Let's make some noise tonight
I'm man enough to get with you
I'll kill my poetry

And write myself a new
A fresh identity devoid of sentimentality
An artist of integrity
I'll give that lonely broken boy to you

If you hold my hair back
When the world gets overwhelming
I will hold your hair back

I will hold your hair back
When the world gets overwhelming

I will hold your hair back
When the world gets overwhelming

Jacob Golden,"I tried to write the perfect song
To let you know that I was wrong
And fix the bloody hole in the roof
Where the hammer fell

My shoes, they fall in foreign places
Looking for my other in a sea of faces
A girl and a boy in the corner
Where the hammer fell

Sometimes I wonder
Is there someone there to carry you
On their shoulders for just a little longer?

I was stuck, stuck, stuck in the past
I saw you at amoeba and we fell so fast
But fairy tales always fade
And the bruises last

I finally wrote the perfect song
I played it in my bedroom all night long
I thought of you but I couldn't call
And the hammer falls

Sometimes I wonder
Is there someone there to carry you
On their shoulders for just a little longer?

At twenty five, I bought a sampler
When my band broke up
I thought I lost my spark
That old reaper left it's mark

Sometimes I throw myself around

Sometimes I wonder
Is there someone there to carry you
On their shoulders for just a little longer?

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

No, I never been a perfect angel
But I try to do the best I can
Sometimes I might just make mistakes
When I got a bottle in my hand 
So when she went through my phone in the morning
Judging by the text she read
She said, ""Boy, by the time I'm done with you
Well, you'd be better off dead”

Oh, no, no, no

Jacob Young,"Wrote the note and I sent it over
It read I'm lonely tonight
She looked up she looked away
I wasn't sure if it reached her
Then that note came back to say
You don't have to be alone
I can't believe that's what it said
You don't' have to be alone, just reply
I stood up, I turned her way
But that's as far as I could get
Before she took my hand 
And led me outside

Let's pretend we can't forget about tomorrow
I make believe we're the only ones alive
Flesh on flesh
She leads me and I follow
Let's not get confused
What's it gonna be
Oh, is this another 8 hour love story?

I woke up dreamin'
About the angel in my darkness
I never even asked her name
As we moved the stone together
I could still smell her sweetness
But I can't believe that I let her go

CHORUS REPEAT

As I lay here on my own
I'm already making plans
The same place the same time
That's where I'm gonna be

Jacob Young,"There's a question inside your mind
Something's gotta give
If she tells you the answer's no
How you gonna live with yourself
'Cause you might seek the truth from deep inside
But you won't know it till it hits you, yeah

[Chorus]
Love is a living thing
Makes you high and makes you sing
Underneath she hides her sting
The devil's in the details
Love is a sudden wind
Blows you down and sucks you in
Whips you then it's gone again
The devil's in the details

If you want that girl you've got to learn
To read between the lines
Play with fire and you might get burned
It happens all the time in her world
When you find her, you can touch her, try to leave her
But she's never gonna miss you, no

[Chorus]

Time to let the games begin
If you don't play then you can't win
Some are truth and some are lies
Some one fools and some are wise

Jacob Young,"Back at school he never worked too hard
The prettiest girls and the fastest cars
He was the hero of our schoolyard
Almost everyday

If we ever felt misunderstood
We'd try on some of his attitude
We always knew from out neighborhood
He would slip away

I remember all those long lost days
When we would he him say

[Chorus]
Life is good and then you die
Don't ask questions, baby, don't ask why
I won't trade places with no other guy
Because life is good

Then the came when he left town
Everybody was gathered round
He told us ""I ain't slowing down
Until the highway ends""

So into the high way he did ride
With his arms in the air and a mighty cry
""Don't forget that James Dean died
For all of our sins""

I remember as he rode away
We could hear him say

[Chorus]
Life is good and then you die
Don't ask questions, baby, don't ask why
I won't trade places with no other guy
Because life is good

When we heard the news
We just couldn't believe it
Somewhere on a lonely highway
Late one night our dreams all slipped away

Years have passed but every now and then
We all wind up together again
And in the honor of our fallen friend
We just have to say

[Chorus: x2]
Life is good and then you die
Don't ask questions, baby, don't ask why
I won't trade places with no other guy
Because life is good

Jacob Young,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Jacob Young,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young

Ou sous le cerisier le coeur grisé tu m'as parlé d'amour

Comme au premier jour toujours, toujours
Je revois le matin ou le destin mettait sur mon chemin
Dans le creux de ta main mes plus beaux lendemains

Mon horizon, mon rayon de soleil
C'est toi dès ton réveil qui fais ma plus jolie chanson
Comme au premier jour toujours, toujours

Et me donne la joie de te sentir à moi autant qu'au premier jour

Si tu partais un jour

Je renierais l'amour

Ne vole pas ce qui nous appartient
Ne détruit pas mon bonheur et le tien.

Do me wrong, do me right, right now baby
Go on and tell me lies, but hold me tight
Save your good-byes for the morning light, morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely tonight
No, no, I don't want to be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely tonight",Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight
Jacqueline Dankworth,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow i'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Jacqueline Dankworth,"I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love  you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it

Jacqueline Dankworth,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Jacqueline Schwab,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Jacques Brel,"Bien sûr, nous eûmes des orages
Vingt ans d'amour, c'est l'amour fol
Mille fois tu pris ton bagage
Mille fois je pris mon envol
Et chaque meuble se souvient
Dans cette chambre sans berceau
Des éclats des vieilles tempêtes
Plus rien ne ressemblait à rien
Tu avais perdu le goût de l'eau
Et moi celui de la conquête

Mais, mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Moi, je sais tous tes sortilèges
Tu sais tous mes envoûtements
Tu m'as gardé de pièges en pièges
Je t'ai perdue de temps en temps
Bien sûr tu pris quelques amants
Il fallait bien passer le temps
Il faut bien que le corps exulte
Finalement, finalement
Il nous fallut bien du talent
Pour être vieux sans être adultes

Oh mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Et plus le temps nous fait cortège
Et plus le temps nous fait tourment
Mais n'est-ce pas le pire piège
Que vivre en paix pour des amants
Bien sûr tu pleures un peu moins tôt
Je me déchire un peu plus tard
Nous protégeons moins nos mystères
On laisse moins faire le hasard
On se méfie du fil de l'eau
Mais c'est toujours la tendre guerre

Oh mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Jacques Brel,"Pourquoi cette fanfare
Quand les soldats par quatre
Attendent les massacres
Sur le quai d'une gare
Pourquoi ce train ventru
Qui ronronne et soupire
Avant de nous conduire
Jusqu'au malentendu
Pourquoi les chants les cris
Des foules venues fleurir
Ceux qui ont le droit d'partir
Au nom de leurs conneries

Nous n'irons plus au bois, la colombe est blessée
Nous n'allons pas au bois, nous allons la tuer

Pourquoi l'heure que voilà
Où finit notre enfance
Où finit notre chance
Où notre train s'en va
Pourquoi ce lourd convoi
Chargé d'hommes en gris
Repeints en une nuit
Pour partir en soldats
Pourquoi ce train de pluie
Pourquoi ce train de guerre
Pourquoi ce cimetière
En marche vers la nuit

Nous n'irons plus au bois, la colombe est blessée
Nous n'allons pas au bois, nous allons la tuer

Pourquoi les monuments
Qu'offriront les défaites
Les phrases déjà faites
Qui suivront l'enterrement
Pourquoi l'enfant mort-né
Que sera la victoire
Pourquoi les jours de gloire
Que d'autres auront payés
Pourquoi ces coins de terre
Que l'on va peindre en gris
Puisque c'est au fusil
Qu'on éteint la lumière

Nous n'irons plus au bois, la colombe est blessée
Nous n'allons pas au bois, nous allons la tuer

Pourquoi ton cher visage
Dégrafé par les larmes
Qui me rendait les armes
Aux sources du voyage
Pourquoi ton corps qui sombre
Ton corps qui disparaît
Et n'est plus sur le quai
Qu'une fleur sur une tombe
Pourquoi ces prochains jours
Où je devrais penser
A ne plus m'habiller
Que d'une moitié d'amour

Nous n'irons plus au bois, la colombe est blessée
Nous n'allons pas au bois, nous allons la tuer",La Colombe
Jacques Brel,"Dors ma mie
Dehors la nuit est noire
Dors ma mie bonsoir
Dors ma mie
C'est notre dernier soir
Dors ma mie bonsoir

Sur les fleurs qui ferment leurs paupières
Pleure la pluie légère
Et l'oiseau qui chantera l'aurore
Dors et rêve encore
Ainsi demain déjà
Serai seul à nouveau
Et tu m'auras perdu
Rien qu'en me voulant trop
Tu m'auras gaspillé
À te vouloir bâtir
Un bonheur éternel
Ennuyeux à périr
Au lieu de te pencher
Vers moi tout simplement
Moi qui avais besoin
Si fort de ton printemps
Non les filles que l'on aime
Ne comprendront jamais
Qu'elles sont à chaque fois

Notre dernière chance
Notre dernier sursaut
Notre dernier départ

Jacques Brel,"Pourvu que nous vienne un homme
Aux portes de la cité
Que l´amour soit son royaume
Et l´espoir son invité
Et qu´il soit pareil aux arbres
Que mon père avait plantés
Fiers et nobles comme soir d´été
Et que les rires d´enfants
Qui lui tintent dans la tête
L´éclaboussent de reflets de fête

Pourvu que nous vienne un homme
Aux portes de la cité
Que son regard soit un psaume
Fait de soleils éclatés
Qu´il ne s´agenouille pas
Devant tout l´or d´un seigneur
Mais parfois pour cueillir une fleur
Et qu´il chasse de la main
A jamais et pour toujours
Les solutions qui seraient sans amour

Pourvu que nous vienne un homme
Aux portes de la cité
Et qui ne soit pas un baume
Mais une force, une clarté
Et que sa colère soit juste
Jeune et belle comme l´orage
Qu´il ne soit jamais ni vieux ni sage
Et qu´il rechasse du temple
L´écrivain sans opinion
Marchand de riens
Marchand d´émotions

Pourvu que nous vienne un homme
Aux portes de la cité
Avant que les autres hommes
Qui vivent dans la cité
Humiliés, l´espoir meurtri
Et lourds de leur colère froide
Ne dressent au creux des nuits
De nouvelles barricades",L' Homme Dans la Cite
Jacques Brel,"Quand Isabelle dort plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle dort au berceau de sa joie

Les oasis du Sahara
Les poissons dorés de la Chine
Et les jardins de l'Alhambra
Quand Isabelle dort plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle dort au berceau de sa joie
Elle vole les rêves et les jeux
D'une rose et d'un bouton d'or
Pour se les poser dans les yeux

Quand Isabelle rit plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle rit au berceau de sa joie
Sais-tu qu'elle vole la cruelle
Le rire des cascades sauvages
Qui remplacent les escarcelles
Des rois qui n'ont pas d'équipages
Quand Isabelle rit plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle rit au berceau de sa joie
Elle vole les fenêtres de l'heure
Qui s'ouvrent sur le paradis
Pour se les poser dans le cœur
Belle Isabelle quand elle rit

Quand Isabelle chante plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle chante au berceau de sa joie
Sais-tu qu'elle vole la dentelle
Tissée au cœur de rossignol
Et les baisers que les ombrelles
Empêchent de prendre leur vol
Quand Isabelle chante plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle chante au berceau de sa joie
Elle vole le velours et la soie
Qu'offre la guitare à l'infante
Pour se les poser dans la voix

Jacques Brel,"Je ne sais pas pourquoi la pluie
Quitte là-haut ses oripeaux
Que sont les lourds nuages gris
Pour se coucher sur nos coteaux
Je ne sais pas pourquoi le vent
S'amuse dans les matins clairs
A colporter les rires d'enfants
Carillons frêles de l'hiver
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore

Je ne sais pas pourquoi la route
Qui me pousse vers la cité
A l'odeur fade des déroutes
De peuplier en peuplier
Je ne sais pas pourquoi le voile
Du brouillard glacé qui m'escorte
Me fait penser aux cathédrales
Où l'on prie pour les amours mortes
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore

Je ne sais pas pourquoi la ville
M'ouvre ses remparts de faubourgs
Pour me laisser glisser fragile
Sous la pluie parmi ses amours
Je ne sais pas pourquoi ces gens
Pour mieux célébrer ma défaite
Pour mieux suivre l'enterrement
Ont le nez collé aux fenêtres
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore

Je ne sais pas pourquoi ces rues
S'ouvrent devant moi une à une
Vierges et froides, froides et nues
Rien que mes pas et pas de lune
Je ne sais pas pourquoi la nuit
Jouant de moi comme guitare
M'a forcé à venir ici
Pour pleurer devant cette gare
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore

Je ne sais pas à quelle heure part
Ce triste train pour Amsterdam
Qu'un couple doit prendre ce soir
Un couple dont tu es la femme
Et je ne sais pas pour quel port

Jacques Brel,"Pour la rosée qui tremble au calice des fleurs
De n'être pas aimée et ressemble à ton cœur

Pour le doigt de la pluie au clavecin de l'étang
Jouant page de lune et ressemble à ton chant
Je t'aime
Pour l'aube qui balance sur le fil d'horizon
Lumineuse et fragile et ressemble à ton front
Je t'aime

Pour l'aurore légère qu'un oiseau fait frémir
En la battant de l'aile et ressemble à ton rire
Je t'aime
Pour le jour qui se lève et dentelle le bois
Au point de la lumière et ressemble à ta joie
Je t'aime
Pour le jour qui revient d'une nuit sans amour
Et ressemble déjà, ressemble à ton retour

Pour la porte qui s'ouvre, pour le cri qui jaillit
Ensemble de deux cœurs et ressemble à ce cri

Claire et blanche un matin
Brusquement devant moi
Quelque part en chemin

La lumière jaillira
Et la reconnaîtrai
Pour l'avoir tant de fois
Chaque jour espérée

La lumière jaillira
Et de la voir si belle
Je connaîtrai pourquoi
J'avais tant besoin d'elle

La lumière jaillira
Et nous nous marierons
Pour n'être qu'un combat
N'être qu'une chanson

La lumière jaillira
Et je l'inviterai
A venir sous mon toit
Pour y tout transformer

La lumière jaillira
Et déjà modifié
Lui avouerai du doigt
Les meubles du passé

La lumière jaillira
Et j'aurai un palais
Tout ne change-t-il pas
Au soleil de juillet?

La lumière jaillira
Et toute ma maison
Assise au feu de bois
Apprendra ses chansons

La lumière jaillira
Parsemant mes silences
De sourires de joie
Qui meurent et recommencent

La lumière jaillira
Qu'éternel voyageur
Mon cœur en vain chercha
Mais qui était en mon cœur

La lumière jaillira
Reculant l'horizon
La lumière jaillira
Et portera ton nom

Ça écoute le merle
Qui dépose ses perles
Sur la portée du vent

D'un monde qui s'entête
A vouloir devenir grand

Quitte à cueillir dans les vitrines
Des jolis quartiers d'Amsterdam
Des lianes qui auraient ce teint de femme
Qu'exportent vos cités latines
Ces soirs-là je les veux félines
Avec un rien de brillantine
Collée au ""ceveu"" de la langue
Elles seraient fraîches comme des mangues
Et compenseraient leur maladresse
À coups de poitrine et de fesses

Y a pas d'Argentines
Y a pas d'espoir
Y a pas d'doute

Mi-Andalouses, mi-anguleuses
De ces femelles qu'on gestapote
Parce qu'elles ne savent pas encore
Que Franco est tout à fait mort

Mais ce soir
Y a pas d'Espagnoles
Y a pas de casseroles
Y a pas d'doute
Non ce soir
Il pleut sur Knokke-le-Zoute
Ce soir comme tous les soirs
Je me rentre chez moi
Le cœur en déroute
Et la bite sous l'bras

Les soirs où je suis Caracas
Je Panama, je Partagas
Je suis l'plus beau
Je pars en chasse
Je glisse de palace en palace
Pour y dénicher le gros lot
Qui n'attend que mon coup de grâce
Je la veux folle comme un travelo
Découverte de vieux rideaux
Mais cependant t-évanescente
Elle m'attendrait depuis toujours
Cerclée de serpents et de plantes
Parmi les livres de Dutourd

Mais ce soir
Y a pas de Caracas
Y a pas de t-évanescentes
Y a pas d'doute

Je me rentre chez moi
Le cœur en déroute
Et la bite sous l'bras

Demain oui
Peut être que
Peut être que demain je serai Argentin, oui
Je m'offrirai des Argentines
Quitte à cueillir dans les vitrines
Des jolis quartiers d'Amsterdam
Des lianes qui auraient ce teint de femme
Qu'exportent vos cités latines
Demain je les voudrai félines
Avec ce rien de brillantine
Collée aux cheveux de la langue
Elles seront fraîches comme des mangues
Et compenseront leur maladresse
À coups de poitrine et de fesses

Demain je serai Espagnol
Petites fesses, grande bagnole
Elles passeront toutes à la casserole
Quitte à pourchasser dans Hambourg
Des Carmencitas de faubourg
Qui nous reviendront de vérole
Je les voudrai fraîches et joyeuses
Bonnes travailleuses, sans parlotte
Mi-Andalouses, mi-anguleuses
De ces femelles qu'on gestapote

Jacques Brel,"Elles sont notre premier ennemi
Quand elles s'échappent en riant
Des pâturages de l'ennui
Les biches
Avec des cils comme des cheveux
Des cheveux en accroche-faon
Et seulement le bout des yeux
Qui triche
Si bien que le chasseur s'arrête
Et que je sais des ouragans
Qu'elles ont changés en poètes
Les biches
Et qu'on les chasse de notre esprit
Ou qu'elles nous chassent en rougissant
Elles sont notre premier ennemi
Les biches de quinze ans

Elles sont notre plus bel ennemi
Quand elles ont l'éclat de la fleur
Et déjà la saveur du fruit
Les biches
Qui passent toute vertu dehors
Alors que c'est de tout leur cœur
Alors que c'est de tout leur corps
Qu'elles trichent
Lorsqu'elles grignotent le mari
Ou lorsqu'elles croquent le diamant
Sur l'asphalte bleu de Paris
Les biches
Qu'on les chasse à coups de rubis
Ou qu'elles nous chassent au sentiment
Elles sont notre plus bel ennemi
Les biches de vingt ans

Elles sont notre pire ennemi
Lorsqu'elles savent leur pouvoir
Mais qu'elles savent leur sursis
Les biches
Quand un chasseur est une chance
Quand leur beauté se lève tard
Quand c'est avec toute leur science
Qu'elles trichent
Trompant l'ennui plus que le cerf
Et l'amant avec l'autre amant
Et l'autre amant avec le cerf
Qui biche
Mais qu'on les chasse à la folie
Ou qu'elles nous chassent du bout des gants
Elles sont notre pire ennemi
Les biches d'après vingt ans

Elles sont notre dernier ennemi
Quand leurs seins tombent de sommeil
Pour avoir veillé trop de nuits
Les biches
Quand elles ont le pas résigné
Des pèlerins qui s'en reviennent
Quand c'est avec tout leur passé
Qu'elles trichent
Afin de mieux nous retenir
Nous qui ne servons à ce temps
Qu'à les empêcher de vieillir
Les biches
Mais qu'on les chasse de notre vie
Ou qu'elles nous chassent parce qu'il est temps
Elles restent notre dernier ennemi
Les biches de trop longtemps",Les Biches

Ils prennent le dernier bon mot
Ils reprennent le dernier whisky
Ils prennent le dernier tango

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Mon amour toi et moi
Pour qu'éclatent de joie
Chaque heure et chaque jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour vivre nos promesses
Sans nulle autre richesse
Que d'y croire toujours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour meubler de merveilles
Et couvrir de soleil
La laideur des faubourgs

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour unique raison
Pour unique chanson
Et unique secours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour habiller matin
Pauvres et malandrins
De manteaux de velours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir en prière
Pour les maux de la terre
En simple troubadour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir à ceux-là
Dont l'unique combat
Est de chercher le jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour parler aux canons
Et rien qu'une chanson
Pour convaincre un tambour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour tracer un chemin
À chaque carrefour

Alors, sans avoir rien
Que la force d'aimer
Nous aurons dans nos mains
Ma mie, le monde entier",Quand on N'A Que l'Amour

Jacques Brel,"Nous étions deux amis et Fanette m'aimait
La plage était déserte et dormait sous juillet
Si elles s'en souviennent les vagues vous diront
Combien pour la Fanette j'ai chanté de chansons

Faut dire
Faut dire qu'elle était belle
Comme une perle d'eau
Faut dire qu'elle était belle
Et je ne suis pas beau

Faut dire
Faut dire qu'elle était brune
Tant la dune était blonde
Et tenant l'autre et l'une
Moi je tenais le monde

Faut dire
Faut dire que j'étais fou
De croire à tout cela
Je le croyais à nous
Je la croyais à moi

Faut dire
Qu'on ne nous apprend pas
A se méfier de tout

Nous étions deux amis et Fanette m'aimait
La plage était déserte et mentait sous juillet
Si elles s'en souviennent les vagues vous diront
Comment pour la Fanette s'arrêta la chanson

Faut dire
Faut dire qu'en sortant
D'une vague mourante
Je les vis s'en allant
Comme amant et amante

Faut dire
Faut dire qu'ils ont ri
Quand ils m'ont vu pleurer
Faut dire qu'ils ont chanté
Quand je les ai maudits

Faut dire
Que c'est bien ce jour-là
Qu'ils ont nagé si loin
Qu'ils ont nagé si bien
Qu'on ne les revit pas

Faut dire
Qu'on ne nous apprend pas
Mais parlons d'autre chose

Nous étions deux amis et Fanette l'aimait
La plage est déserte et pleure sous juillet
Et le soir quelquefois, quand les vagues s'arrêtent
J'entends comme une voix
J'entends c'est la Fanette

Ni ces ""je t'aime"" ni ces amours
Que l'on poursuit à travers cœurs
De gris en gris de pleurs en pleurs
Ni ces bras blancs d'une seule nuit
Collier de femme pour notre ennui
Que l'on dénoue au petit jour
Par des promesses de retour
Ni tout cela ni rien au monde
Ne sait pas nous faire oublier
Ne peut pas nous faire oublier
Qu'aussi vrai que la Terre est ronde

On n'oublie rien de rien
On n'oublie rien du tout
On n'oublie rien de rien
On s'habitue c'est tout

Ni même ce temps où j'aurais fait
Mille chansons de mes regrets
Ni même ce temps où mes souvenirs
Prendront mes rides pour un sourire
Ni ce grand lit où mes remords
Ont rendez-vous avec la mort
Ni ce grand lit que je souhaite
A certains jours comme une fête
Ni tout cela ni rien au monde
Ne sait pas nous faire oublier
Ne peut pas nous faire oublier
Qu'aussi vrai que la Terre est ronde

On n'oublie rien de rien
On n'oublie rien du tout
On n'oublie rien de rien
On s'habitue c'est tout",On N'Oublie Rien
Jacques Brel,"Avec la mer du Nord pour dernier terrain vague
Et des vagues de dunes pour arrêter les vagues
Et de vagues rochers que les marées dépassent
Et qui ont à jamais le cœur à marée basse
Avec infiniment de brumes à venir
Avec le vent de l'est écoutez-le tenir
Le plat pays qui est le mien

Avec des cathédrales pour uniques montagnes
Et de noirs clochers comme mâts de cocagne
Où des diables en pierre décrochent les nuages
Avec le fil des jours pour unique voyage
Et des chemins de pluie pour unique bonsoir
Avec le vent d'ouest écoutez-le vouloir
Le plat pays qui est le mien

Avec un ciel si bas qu'un canal s'est perdu
Avec un ciel si bas qu'il fait l'humilité
Avec un ciel si gris qu'un canal s'est pendu
Avec un ciel si gris qu'il faut lui pardonner
Avec le vent du nord qui vient s'écarteler
Avec le vent du nord écoutez-le craquer
Le plat pays qui est le mien

Avec de l'Italie qui descendrait l'Escaut
Avec Frida la Blonde quand elle devient Margot
Quand les fils de novembre nous reviennent en mai
Quand la plaine est fumante et tremble sous juillet
Quand le vent est au rire quand le vent est au blé
Quand le vent est au sud écoutez-le chanter
Le plat pays qui est le mien.",Le Plat Pays
Jacques Brel,"On a beau faire, on a beau dire
Qu'un homme averti en vaut deux
On a beau faire, on a beau dire
Ça fait du bien d'être amoureux

Je sais, je sais que ce prochain amour
Sera pour moi la prochaine défaite
Je sais déjà à l'entrée de la fête
La feuille morte que sera le petit jour
Je sais, je sais, sans savoir ton prénom
Que je serai ta prochaine capture
Je sais déjà que c'est par leur murmure
Que les étangs mettent les fleuves en prison

Mais on a beau faire, on a beau dire
Qu'un homme averti en vaut deux
On a beau faire, on a beau dire
Ça fait du bien d'être amoureux

Je sais, je sais que ce prochain amour
Ne vivra pas jusqu'au prochain été
Je sais déjà que le temps des baisers
Pour deux chemins ne dure qu'un carrefour
Je sais, je sais que ce prochain amour
Sera pour moi la prochaine des guerres
Je sais déjà cette affreuse prière
Qu'il faut pleurer quand l'autre est le vainqueur

Mais on a beau faire, on a beau dire
Qu'un homme averti en vaut deux
On a beau faire, on a beau dire
Ça fait du bien d'être amoureux

Je sais, je sais que ce prochain amour
Sera pour nous de vivre un nouveau règne
Dont nous croirons tous deux porter les chaînes
Dont nous croirons que l'autre a le velours
Je sais, je sais que ma tendre faiblesse
Fera de nous des navires ennemis
Mais mon cœur sait des navires ennemis
Partant ensemble pour pêcher la tendresse

Car on a beau faire, on a beau dire
Qu'un homme averti en vaut deux
On a beau dire
Ça fait du bien d'être amoureux",Le Prochain Amour
Jacques Brel,"Rosa rosa rosam
Rosae rosae rosa
Rosae rosae rosas
Rosarum rosis rosis

C'est le plus vieux tango du monde
Celui que les têtes blondes
Ânonnent comme une ronde
En apprenant leur latin
C'est le tango du collège
Qui prend les rêves au piège
Et dont il est sacrilège
De ne pas sortir malin
C'est le tango des bons pères
Qui surveillent l'oeil sévère
Les Jules et les Prosper
Qui seront la France de demain

Rosa rosa rosam
Rosae rosae rosa
Rosae rosae rosas
Rosarum rosis rosis

C'est le tango des forts en thème
Boutonneux jusqu'à l'extrême
Et qui recouvrent de laine
Leur cœur qui est déjà froid
C'est le tango des forts en rien
Qui déclinent de chagrin
Et qui seront pharmaciens
Parce que papa ne l'était pas
C'est le temps où j'étais dernier
Car ce tango rosa rosae
J'inclinais à lui préférer
Déjà ma cousine Rosa

Rosa rosa rosam
Rosae rosae rosa
Rosae rosae rosas
Rosarum rosis rosis

C'est le tango des promenades
Deux par seul sous les arcades
Cernés de corbeaux et d'alcades
Qui nous protégeaient des pourquoi
C'est le tango de la pluie sur la cour
Le miroir d'une flaque sans amour
Qui m'a fait comprendre un beau jour
Que je ne serai pas Vasco de Gama
Mais c'est le tango du temps béni
Où pour un baiser trop petit
Dans la clairière d'un jeudi
A rosi cousine Rosa

Rosa rosa rosam
Rosae rosae rosa
Rosae rosae rosas
Rosarum rosis rosis

C'est le tango du temps des zéros
J'en avais tant des minces des gros
Que j'en faisais des tunnels pour Charlot
Des auréoles pour Saint François
C'est le tango des récompenses
Qui allaient à ceux qui ont de la chance
D'apprendre dès leur enfance
Tout ce qui ne leur servira pas
Mais c'est le tango que l'on regrette
Une fois que le temps s'achète
Et que l'on s'aperçoit tout bête
Qu'il y a des épines aux Rosa

Jacques Brel,"On est deux mon amour 
Et l`amour chante et rit 
Mais à la mort do jour 
Dans les draps de l`ennui 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est dix à défendre 
Les vivants par des morts 
Mais cloués par leurs cendres 
Au poteau do remords 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est cent qui dansons 
Au bal des bons copains 
Mais au dernier lampion 
Mais au premier chagrin 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est mille contre mille 
A se croire les plus forts 
Mais à l`heure imbécile 
Où ça fait deux mille morts 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est million à rire 
do million qui est en face 
Mais deux millions de rires 
N`empêchent que dans la glace 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est mille à s`asseoir 
Au sommet de la fortune 
Mais dans la peur de voir 
Tout fondre sous la lune 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est cent que la gloire 
Invite sans raison 
Mais quand meurt le hasard 
Quand finit la chanson 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est dix à coucher 
Dans le lit de la puissance 
Mais devant ces armées 
Qui s`enterrent en silence 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est deux à vieillir 
Contre le temps qui cogne 
Mais lorsqu`on voit venir 
En riant la charogne 
On se retrouve seul.",Seul
Jacques Brel,"Pour un peu de tendresse
Je donnerais les diamants
Que le diable caresse
Dans mes coffres d'argent
Pourquoi crois-tu, la belle
Que les marins au port
Vident leurs escarcelles
Pour offrir des trésors
A de fausses princesses
Pour un peu de tendresse?

Pour un peu de tendresse
Je changerais de visage
Je changerais d'ivresse
Je changerais de langage
Pourquoi crois-tu, la belle
Qu'au sommet de leurs chants
Empereurs et ménestrels
Abandonnent souvent
Puissances et richesses
Pour un peu de tendresse?

Pour un peu de tendresse
Je t'offrirais le temps
Qu'il reste de jeunesse
A l'été finissant
Pourquoi crois-tu, la belle
Que monte ma chanson
Vers la claire dentelle
Qui danse sur ton front
Penché vers ma détresse
Pour un peu de tendresse?",La Tendresse
Jacques Brel,"Même si un jour à Knokke-le-Zoute
Je deviens comme je le redoute
Chanteur pour femmes finissantes
Même si j'leur chante ""Mi Corazon""
Avec la voix bandonéante
D'un Argentin de Carcassonne
Même si on m'appelle Antonio
Que je brûle mes derniers feux
En échange de quelques cadeaux
Madame, je fais ce que je peux
Même si j'me saoule à l'hydromel
Pour mieux parler d'virilité
A des mémères décorées
Comme des arbres de Noël
Je sais qu'dans ma soûlographie
Chaque nuit pour des éléphants roses
Je chanterai ma chanson morose
Celle du temps où j'm'appelais Jacky

Être une heure, une heure seulement
Être une heure, une heure quelquefois
Être une heure, rien qu'une heure durant
Beau, beau, beau et con à la fois

Même si un jour à Macao
J'deviens gouverneur de tripot
Cerclé de femmes languissantes
Même si lassé d'être chanteur
J'y sois devenu maître chanteur
Et qu'ce soit les autres qui chantent
Même si on m'appelle le beau Serge
Que je vende des bateaux d'opium
Du whisky de Clermont-Ferrand
De vrais pédés, de fausses vierges
Que j'aie une banque à chaque doigt
Et un doigt dans chaque pays
Et que chaque pays soit à moi
Je sais quand même que chaque nuit
Tout seul au fond de ma fumerie
Pour un public de vieux Chinois
Je rechanterai ma chanson à moi
Celle du temps où j'm'appelais Jacky

Être une heure, une heure seulement
Être une heure, une heure quelquefois
Être une heure, rien qu'une heure durant
Beau, beau, beau et con à la fois

Même si un jour au Paradis
J'devienne comme j'en serais surpris
Chanteur pour femmes à ailes blanches
Que je leur chante ""Alléluia!""
En regrettant le temps d'en bas
Où c'est pas tous les jours dimanche
Même si on m'appelle Dieu le Père
Celui qui est dans l'annuaire
Entre ""Dieulefit"" et ""Dieu vous garde""
Même si je m'laisse pousser la barbe
Même si toujours trop bonne pomme
Je m'crève le cœur et l'pur esprit
A vouloir consoler les hommes
Je sais quand même que chaque nuit
J'entendrai dans mon paradis
Les anges, les Saints et Lucifer
Me chanter la chanson d'naguère
Celle du temps où j'm'appelais Jacky

Être une heure, une heure seulement
Être une heure, une heure quelquefois
Être une heure, rien qu'une heure durant
Beau, beau, beau et con à la fois",La Chanson de Jacky
Jacques Brel,"Se tiennent par la main
Et marchent en silence
Dans ces villes éteintes
Que le crachin balance

Ne sonnent que leurs pas
Pas à pas fredonnés
Ils marchent en silence
Les désespérés

Ils ont brûlé leurs ailes
Ils ont perdu leurs branches
Tellement naufragés
Que la mort paraît blanche

Ils reviennent d'amour
Ils se sont réveillés
Ils marchent en silence
Les désespérés

Et je sais leur chemin
Pour l'avoir cheminé
Déjà plus de cent fois
Cent fois plus qu'à moitié

Moins vieux ou plus meurtris
Ils vont le terminer
Ils marchent en silence
Les désespérés

Lente sous le pont
L'eau est douce et profonde
Voici la bonne hôtesse
Voici la fin du monde

Ils pleurent leurs prénoms
Comme de jeunes mariés
Et fondent en silence
Les désespérés

Que se lève celui
Qui leur lance la pierre
Ils ne sait de l'amour
Que le verbe s'aimer

Sur le pont n'est plus rien
Qu'une brume légère
Ça s'oublie en silence
Ceux qui ont espéré

",Les Desesperes
Jacques Brel,"Tout nu dans ma serviette qui me servait de pagne
J'avais le rouge au front et le savon à la main
Au suivant, au suivant
J'avais juste vingt ans et nous étions cent vingt
A être le suivant de celui qu'on suivait
Au suivant, au suivant
J'avais juste vingt ans et je me déniaisais
Au bordel ambulant d'une armée en campagne
Au suivant, au suivant

Moi j'aurais bien aimé un peu plus de tendresse
Ou alors un sourire ou bien avoir le temps
Mais au suivant, au suivant
Ce n'fut pas Waterloo mais ce n'fut pas Arcole
Ce fut l'heure où l'on regrette d'avoir manqué l'école
Au suivant, au suivant
Mais je jure que d'entendre cet adjudant d'mes fesses
C'est des coups à vous faire des armées d'impuissants
Au suivant, au suivant

Je jure sur la tête de ma première vérole
Que cette voix depuis je l'entends tout le temps
Au suivant, au suivant
Cette voix qui sentait l'ail et le mauvais alcool
C'est la voix des nations et c'est la voix du sang
Au suivant, au suivant
Et depuis chaque femme à l'heure de succomber
Entre mes bras trop maigres semble me murmurer
""Au suivant, au suivant""

Tous les suivants du monde devraient s'donner la main
Voilà ce que la nuit je crie dans mon délire
Au suivant, au suivant
Et quand je n'délire pas, j'en arrive à me dire
Qu'il est plus humiliant d'être suivi que suivant
Au suivant, au suivant
Un jour je m'ferai cul-de-jatte ou bonne sœur ou pendu
Enfin un d'ces machins où je n'serai jamais plus
Le suivant, le suivant",Au Suivant
Jacques Brel,"Ah, je les vois déjà
Me couvrant de baisers
Et s'arrachant mes mains
Et demandant tout bas
""Est-ce que la mort s'en vient?
Est-ce que la mort s'en va?
Est-ce qu'il est encore chaud?
Est-ce qu'il est déjà froid?""
Ils ouvrent mes armoires
Ils tâtent mes faïences
Ils fouillent mes tiroirs
Se régalant d'avance
De mes lettres d'amour
Enrubannées par deux
Qu'ils liront près du feu
En riant aux éclats
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ah, je les vois déjà
Compassés et frileux
Suivant comme des artistes
Mon costume de bois
Ils se poussent du cœur
Pour être le plus triste
Ils se poussent du bras
Pour être le premier
Z'ont amené des vieilles
Qui ne me connaissaient plus
Z'ont amené des enfants
Qui ne me connaissaient pas
Pensent au prix des fleurs
Et trouvent indécent
De ne pas mourir au printemps
Quand on aime le lilas
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ah, je les vois déjà
Tous mes chers faux amis
Souriant sous le poids
Du devoir accompli
Ah, je te vois déjà
Trop triste, trop à l'aise
Protégeant sous le drap
Tes larmes lyonnaises
Tu ne sais même pas
Sortant de mon cimetière
Que tu entres en ton enfer
Quand s'accroche à ton bras
Le bras de ton quelconque
Le bras de ton dernier
Qui te fera pleurer
Bien autrement que moi
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ah, je me vois déjà
M'installant à jamais
Bien au triste, bien au froid
Dans mon champ d'osselets
Ah, je me vois déjà
Je me vois tout au bout
De ce voyage-là
D'où l'on revient de tout
Je vois déjà tout ça
Et l'on a le brave culot
D'oser me demander
De n'plus boire que de l'eau
De n'plus trousser les filles
De mettre d'l'argent d'côté
D'aimer l'filet d'maquereau
Et d'crier, ""Vive le roi!""

Je t'en supplie, reviens!
Tu as changé, j'sais bien
T'es un peu moins tentante
Puis tu marches comme Chaplin
Puis t’es devenue parlante

Jacques Brel,"Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui chantent
Les rêves qui les hantent
Au large d’Amsterdam
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui dorment
Comme des oriflammes
Le long des berges mornes
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui meurent
Pleins de bière et de drames
Aux premières lueurs
Mais dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui naissent
Dans la chaleur épaisse
Des langueurs océanes

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui mangent
Sur des nappes trop blanches
Des poissons ruisselants
Ils vous montrent des dents
A croquer la fortune
A décroiser la lune
A bouffer des haubans
Et ça sent la morue
Jusque dans le cœur des frites
Que leurs grosses mains invitent
A revenir en plus
Puis se lèvent en riant
Dans un bruit de tempête
Referment leur braguette
Et sortent en rotant

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui dansent
En se frottant la panse
Sur la panse des femmes
Et ils tournent et ils dansent
Comme des soleils crachés
Dans le son déchiré
D’un accordéon rance
Ils se tordent le cou
Pour mieux s’entendre rire
Jusqu’à ce que tout à coup
L’accordéon expire
Alors le geste grave
Alors le regard fier
Ils ramènent leur batave
Jusqu’en pleine lumière

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui boivent
Et qui boivent et reboivent
Et qui reboivent encore
Ils boivent à la santé
Des putains d’Amsterdam
De Hambourg ou d’ailleurs
Enfin ils boivent aux dames
Qui leur donnent leur joli corps
Qui leur donnent leur vertu
Pour une pièce en or
Et quand ils ont bien bu
Se plantent le nez au ciel
Se mouchent dans les étoiles
Et ils pissent comme je pleure
Sur les femmes infidèles
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Dans le port d’Amsterdam.",Amsterdam
Jacques Brel,"Donne-moi la main
Le soleil a paru
Il nous faut prendre le chemin
Le temps des moissons est venu

Le blé nous a tant attendu
Et nous attendons trop de pain
Ta main sur mon bras
Pleine de douceur

Bien gentiment demandera
De vouloir épargner les fleurs
Ma faucille les évitera
Pour éviter que tu ne pleures

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Donne-moi tes yeux
Le soleil est chaud
Et dans ton regard lumineux
Il a fait jaillir des jets d'eau

Qui mieux qu'un geste
Mieux qu'un mot
Rafraichiront ton amoureux
Penchée vers le sol, tu gerbes le blé

Et si parfois ton jupon vole
Pardonne-moide regarder
Les trésors que vient dévoiler
Pour mon plaisir le vent frivole

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Donne-moi ton cœur
Le soleil fatigué
S'en est allé
Chanter ailleurs

La chanson des blés moisonnés
Venu est le tempsde s'aimer
Il nous faut glaner le bonheur
Ecrasés d'amour éblouis de joie

Je saluerai la fin du jour
En te serrant tout contre moi
Et tu combleras mon émoi
En me disant que pour toujours

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Les blés sont pour la faucille
Les soleils pour l'horizon
Les garçons sont pour les filles
Et les filles pour les garçons

Il y avait mon grand-père
Il y avait ma grand-mère
Il attendait la guerre
Elle attendait mon père
Ils étaient gais comme le canal
Et on voudrait que j'aie le moral

Jacques Brel,"Dans les campagnes y a les filles
Les filles qui vont chercher l'eau
A tire-larigot

Les filles font la file gentille
Et tout en parlant tout haut
Les filles font la file gentille
Et tout en parlant tout haut
Du feu et de l'eau

C'est comme ça depuis que le monde tourne
Y a rien à faire pour y changer
C'est comme ça depuis que le monde tourne
Et il vaut mieux ne pas y toucher

Près des filles y a les garçons
Les longs, les minces et les gras
Qui rigolent tout bas
Les noirs, les roses et les blonds
Qui parlent de leur papa
Les noirs, les roses et les blonds
Qui parlent de leur papa
Et des yeux doux d'Isa

Y a les garçons, y a les papas
Qui ont l'air graves et sévères
Et qui sentent la bière

Et sortent le soir par derrière
Ils crient pour n'importe quoi
Et sortent le soir par derrière

Y a aussi les verres vides
Et les copains qu'on aime bien
Vous font rentrer à l'aube livide
Et les copains qu'on aime bien
Vous font rentrer à l'aube livide
Toutes les poches vides

Près des copains il y a la ville
La ville immense et inutile
Où je me fais de la bile
La ville avec ses plaisirs vils
Qui pue l'essence d'automobile
La ville avec ses plaisirs vils
Qui pue l'essence d'automobile
Ou la guerre civile

C'est comme ça depuis que le monde tourne
Y a rien à faire pour y changer
C'est comme ça depuis que le monde tourne
Et il vaut mieux ne pas y toucher

Près de la ville il y a la campagne
Où les filles brunes ou blondes
Dansent à la ronde
Et par la plaine par la montagne
Laissons-les fermer la ronde
Et par la plaine par la montagne
Laissons-les fermer la ronde
Des braves gens du monde

C'est comme ça depuis que le monde tourne
Y a rien à faire pour y changer
C'est comme ça depuis que le monde tourne
Et il vaut mieux ne pas y toucher

Jacques Brel,"De Rotterdam à Santiago
Et d'Amsterdam à Varsovie
De Cracovie à San Diego
De drame en dame
Passe la vie
De peu à peu
De cœur en cœur
De peur en peur
De port en port
Le temps d'une fleur
Et l'on s'endort
Le temps d'un rêve
Et l'on est mort

Rencontrée une nuit

Je t'aurais dit ""amour""
Je t'aurais dit ""toujours""

Mais par mille détours
Je t'aurais dit ""partons""

Jacques Brel,"Un jour
Un jour le diable vint sur Terre
Un jour le diable vint sur Terre

Pour surveiller ses intérêts
Il a tout vu le diable, il a tout entendu
Et après avoir tout vu
Et après avoir tout entendu

Il est retourné chez lui, là-bas
Et là-bas, on avait fait un grand banquet
A la fin du banquet, il s'est levé le diable
Il a prononcé un discours

Ça va
Il y a toujours un peu partout
Des feux illuminant la Terre

Ça va
Les hommes s'amusent comme des fous
Au dangereux jeu de la guerre

Ça va
Les trains déraillent avec fracas
Parce que des gars pleins d'idéal
Mettent des bombes sur les voies

Ça fait des morts originales
Ça fait des morts sans confession
Des confessions sans rémission
Ça va

Rien ne se vend mais tout s'achète
L'honneur et même la sainteté

Ça va
Les États se muent en cachette
En anonymes sociétés

Ça va
Les grands s'arrachent les dollars
Venus du pays des enfants
L'Europe répète l'Avare

Dans un décor de mil neuf cent
Ça fait des morts d'inanition
Et l'inanition des nations
Ça va

Les hommes, ils en ont tant vu
Que leurs yeux sont devenus gris

Ça va
Et l'on ne chante même plus
Dans toutes les rues de Paris

Ça va
On traite les braves de fous
Et les poètes de nigauds
Mais dans les journaux de partout

Tous les salauds ont leur photo
Ça fait mal aux honnêtes gens
Et rire les malhonnêtes gens
Ça va, ça va, ça va, ça va",Le Diable

C'est beau comme un r'nard
C'est beau comme un r'tard
C'est beaucoup trop tard

C'est beau tant qu'ça peut
C'est beau comme l'adieu
Et c'est beaucoup mieux

C'est beau comme des chiens

Ça vous pend au cou

Ça donne à penser
Ça vous donne congé

Ça se donne pourtant
Ça se donne un temps
C'est donnant donnant

Les filles
Ça donne de l'amour
A chacun son tour
Ça donne sur la cour

Les filles
Ça vous donne son corps
Ça se donne si fort
Que ça donne des r'mords

Mais les chiens
Ça ne vous donne rien
Parce que ça n'sait pas
Faire semblant d'donner

Jacques Brel,"J'aime la foire où pour trois sous
L'on peut se faire tourner la tête
Sur les manèges aux chevaux roux
Au son d'une musique bête

Les lampions jettent au firmament
Alignés en nombres pairs
Comme des sourcils de géant
Leurs crachats de lumières

Les moulins tournent, tournent sans trêve
Emportant tout notre argent
Et nous donnant un peu de rêve
Pour que les hommes soient contents

Sur les manèges aux chevaux roux
Au son d'une musique bête

Ça sent la graisse où dansent les frites
Ça sent les frites dans les papiers
Ça sent les beignets qu'on mange vite
Ça sent les hommes qui les ont mangés

Partout je vois à petits pas
Des couples qui s'en vont danser
Mais moi sûrement je n'irai pas

En un château d'autrefois
Pour l'amour d'une reine

Et vivent les bossus
Ma mère
Et vivent les pendus
Et vivent les bossus
Ma mère

Jacques Brel,"C'est trop facile d'entrer aux églises
De déverser toutes sa saleté
Face au curé qui dans la lumière grise
Ferme les yeux pour mieux nous pardonner

Tais-toi donc Grand Jacques
Que connais-tu du bon Dieu?
Un cantique une image
Tu n'en connais rien de mieux

C'est trop facile quand les guerres sont finies
D'aller gueuler que c'était la dernière
Amis bourgeois vous me faites envie
Vous ne voyez donc point vos cimetières

Tais-toi donc Grand Jacques
Laisse-les donc crier
Laisse-les pleurer de joie
Toi qui ne fus même pas soldat

C'est trop facile quand un amour se meurt
Qu'il craque en deux parce qu'on l'a trop plié
D'aller pleurer comme les hommes pleurent
Comme si l'amour durait l'éternité

Tais-toi donc Grand Jacques
Que connais-tu de l'amour?
Des yeux bleus des cheveux fous
Tu n'en connais rien du tout

Et dis-toi donc Grand Jacques 
Dis-le-toi bien souvent
C’est trop facile

Jacques Brel,"Comme un marin je partirai
Pour aller rire chez les filles
Et si jamais tu en pleurais
Moi j'en aurais l'âme ravie

Comme un novice je partirai
Pour aller prier le bon Dieu
Et si jamais tu en souffrais
Moi je n'en prierais que mieux

Tu n'as commis d'autre péché
Que de distiller chaque jour
L'ennui et la banalité
Quand d'autres distillent l'amour

Et mille jours pour une nuit
Voilà ce que tu m'as donné
Tu as peint notre amour en gris
Terminé notre éternité

Comme un ivrogne je partirai
Pour aller gueuler ma chanson
Et si jamais tu l'entendais
J'en remercierais le démon

Comme un soldat je partirai
Mourir comme meurent les enfants
Et si jamais tu en mourais
J'en voudrais revenir vivant

Et toi tu pries et toi tu pleures
Au long des jours, au long des ans
C'est comme si avec des fleurs
On ressoudait deux continents

L'amour est mort, vive la haine
Et toi matériel déclassé
Va-t-en donc accrocher ta peine
Au musée des amours ratées

Comme un ivrogne je partirai
Pour aller gueuler ma chanson
Et si jamais tu l'entendais
J'en remercierais le démon",La Haine

Heureux qui sanglote de joie
Pour s'être enfin donné d'amour
Ou pour un baiser que l'on boit
Heureux qui sanglote de joie

Heureux les amants séparés
Et qui ne savent pas encore
Qu'ils vont demain se retrouver
Heureux les amants séparés

Heureux les amants épargnés
Et dont la force de vingt ans
Ne sert à rien qu'à bien s'aimer
Heureux les amants épargnés

Heureux les amants que nous sommes
Et qui demain loin l'un de l'autre
S'aimeront, s'aimeront
Par-dessus les hommes
