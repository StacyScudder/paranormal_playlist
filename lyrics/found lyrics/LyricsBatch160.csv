Hank Williams,"When you're alone and blue tonight my little darlin'
And you're pillows stained with tears from your blue eyes
I'm so sorry dear to say we're not together
But you know you caused it all by telling lies

Now I know I'll never find another sweetheart
When you left I hung my head down and I cried
But we quarreled and now we're through my little darlin'
And you know you caused it all by telling lies

We were happy, oh so happy little darlin'
And our little home was like a paradise
But today you're all alone and broken hearted
And you know you caused it all by telling lies

Now I know I'll never find another sweetheart
When you left I hung my head down and I cried
But we quarreled and now we're through my little darlin'
And you know you caused it all by telling lies",You Caused It All by Telling Lies [#]
Hank Williams,"I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart?",Cold Cold Heart [the Afrs Shows]
Hank Williams,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian
Standin' over by the door
Fell in love with a Chocktaw maid
Over in the Georgia store

Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never let it show
She don't ever answer, yes or no

And he always wore his Sunday feathers
And carried his old black hawk
Maiden wore her beads and braids
An hoped someday he'd talk

Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never show a sign
'Cause his heart is made of knotty pine

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you ain't never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you don't know what you what miss
Is it any wonder that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor old wooden head

Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian
Never went nowhere
Heart was set on the Chocktaw maid
Wearin' the long, black hair

Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never show a sign
'Cause his heart was made of knotty pine

And then one day, a wealthy customer
Bought the Indian maid
Took her oh so far away
And ol' Kaw-Liga stayed

Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, as lonesome as can be
Ah, just wishin' he were still an ol' pine tree

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you just ain't never had no kissin'
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, hoss, you don't know what you're missin'
Is it any wonder, that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor, ol' wooden head

Just a head
Just a head",Kaw-Liga [Demo with 2 False Starts]
Hank Williams,"I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
O the day we met, I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I take a cost, o the lost highway

Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway","Lost Highway [the ""Farmer Jim"" Tapes]"
Hank Williams,"I was ridin' number nine
Headin' south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Got in trouble, had to roam
Left my gal and left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid actin' smart
I went and broke my darlin's heart
I guess I was too young to know

They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit and cry
When the evenin' train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow

I'll never see that gal of mine
Lord, I'm in Georgia doin' time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
","Lonesome Whistle, (I Heard That)"

Hank Williams,"I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by;
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die, Oh Lord!
And then I jumped in the river, but the doggone river was dry.
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.

I had me a woman who couldn't be true.
She made me for my money and she made me blue.
A man needs a woman that he can lean on,
But my leanin' post is done left and gone.
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.

I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice.
And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, Oh Lord!
I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice.
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.

She told me on Sunday she was checkin' me out
Long about Monday she was nowhere about.
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news.
I got them gone but not forgotten blues.
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.",Long Gone Lonesome Blues [#]
Hank Williams,"When my baby moved out and the blues moved in
There wasn't nothin' I could do
But mosey around with my head in my hands
Lord what am I comin' to
I just keep moanin' 
Moa-oanin' the blues.

I wrote a nice, long letter
Sayin' mama please come home
Your dad-ad-dy is lon-one-some
And all I do is moan
I been lovin' that gal for so doggone long
I can't afford to lose her now
I thought I was right but I must of been wrong
'Cause my head is startin' to bow 
And now I'm moanin' 
Moa-oanin' the blues. 

If you want a good gal to stay around
You gotta treat her nice and kind
If you do her wrong she'll leave this town
And you'll almost lose your mind
Then you'll moanin' moa-oanin' the blues.

Aw baby, baby, baby
Honey baby, please come home
Your dad-ad-dy is lon-one-some and all I do is moan
I promise you baby that I'll be good

Hank Williams,"Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Ev'rybody's thinkin' 'bout somebody else

nobody is lonesome for me.

Ev'rybody's longin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

Ev'rybody's crazy 'bout somebody else
But nobody's crazy 'bout me
Oh, I shined up my shoes and then I slicked down my hair
Put on my Sunday suit, but I ain't goin' nowhere
Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me.

Ev'rybody's yearnin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Ev'rybody's fallin' for somebody else
But nobody's fallin' for me

Hank Williams,"I don't care if tomorrow never comes
This world holds nothin' for me
I've been lonely night and day ever since you went away
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes. 

[Chorus]
If tomorrow never comes and the sun don't ever shine
It won't matter with me
For when she went away, my world ended that day
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes.

My lonely mind wanders back to days that used to be
My broken heart cries out for you
Oh, if I can't have you here, I can't go on my dear
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes.

Hank Williams,"You don't dress up in satin,
You don't wear diamond rings,
But I'm satisfied with you.
You look just like an angel but you haven't got wings,
But I'm satisfied with you.

I'd rather have you just the way that you are
Than change you for somebody new.
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star,
But I'm satisfied with you.

You're not made out of candy
But you're as sweet as you can be
So I'm satisfied with you.
I just can't see no reason why you bother with me,
But I'm satisfied with you.

I often wonder if it's all a mistake
It's hard to believe that it's true.
But If I'm only dreaming, I sure don't want to wake,
'Cause I'm satisfied with you.
I'm satisfied with you.",Im Satisfied with You
Hank Williams,"Took my gal to the picture show, just the other day,

Here's  what she had to (e) say.

No not now, (no not now), no not now, (no not now),
No not now, but maybe next week some how.

Walked my gal home to the door, and asked her for a kiss,
But she quickly turned away, and then she told me this.

I asked my gal to marry me, reckon what she said,
She said I wouldn't marry you, if all the rest were dead.

But she went and changed her mind, how I regret that day,
Cause every since I married her, here's all that she can say.

Hank Williams,"As we journey along, on life's wicked road,
So selfish are we, for silver and gold,
You can treasure your wealth, your diamonds and gold,
But my friends it won't save, your poor wicked soul.

For when god calls, from his home up on high,
To your earthly wealth, you must say goodbye,
Then it's useless to you, if you've strayed from the fold,
For my friend it won't save your poor wicked soul.

The rich man like all, will be judged at that time,
But all of his wealth, will be left behind.
For no matter how much earthly wealth you get hold,
Well my friend it won't save, your poor wicked soul.",Wealth Wont Save Your Soul
Hank Williams,"In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
Where only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven

We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting

Hank Williams,"(e) I was strollin' one day, in a lonely graveyard,
When a voice from the tomb, seemed to (b7) say,
I once (e) lived as you live, walked and talked as you talk,
But from earth I was (b7) soon called a- (e) way.

Chorus

(e) oh, those tombs, (""oh those tombs""),
Lonely tombs, (""lonely tombs ""),
Seemed to say in a low gentle (b7) tone,
Oh how (e) sweet, (""oh how sweet""),
Is the rest, (""is the rest""),
In our beautiful, (b7) heavenly (e) home.

Every voice from the tomb, seemed to whisper and say,
Livin' man you must soon follow me,
And I thought as I gazed, on that cold marble slab,
What a sad lonesome place that must be.

Repeat chorus

I then came to the place, where my mother did lay,
And her voice, soft and low, from the tomb,
It said, son I'm at rest, with the savior above,
I am safe in my heavenly home.

Hank Williams,"Out on the corner standin' so bold
Stood a little paper boy so hungry and cold
And as the crowd came passin' by
These words he said with tears in his eyes

""Please buy a paper from me
So I can get me somethin' to eat
My clothes are ragged, no shoes on my feet""
Said the little paper boy, there on the street

""Out in this cold wide world all alone
I have no place on this earth to call home
I haven't had the chance that other kids had
I have no mother, nor even a dad""

""So please buy a paper from me
So I can get me somethin' to eat
My clothes are ragged, no shoes on my feet""
Said the little paper boy, there on the street

Early next mornin' as the crowd passed by
The little boy was gone and they wondered why
They started searchin' and then found him dead

If you only want to hurt me

Always bloom in memory
Faded love and winter roses
Yearning hearts that used to be

Will they meet again tomorrow
Where we parted yesterday
Give me back the winter roses
And the love you took away

Faded love and winter roses
Sprinkled with a lonely tear
Faded love and winter roses
Still recall each yesteryear

Will I always be a dreamer
Dreaming of the used to be
Faded love and winter roses
Live and die in memory

Hank Williams,"The ceremony was over
A lad stood alone in tears
For he had just said goodbye
To the one he had loved through the years

He stood all alone with his head bowed down
As though his heart would break
Then the parson came over and took his hand
And to him these words he did say

When God comes and gathers His jewels
All His treasures of diamonds and gold
You'll meet her up there, up in Heaven so fair
When God comes and gathers His jewels

Each night when the pale moon is shining
You can see this lad all alone
With his eyes lifted towards Heaven
He's repeating these words he was told

When God comes and gathers His jewels
All His treasures of diamonds and gold
I'll meet you up there, up in Heaven so fair
When God comes and gathers His jewels

Too many boyfriends and sociable gals may drive your sweetheart away
Gentlemen of the jury the judge's speech began

The scene was a crowded courtroom and the judge a stern old man
This prisoner here before you is a social enemy
A lady of the evening and you know the penalty

Her eyes reflect the nightlife her cheeks they're red with paint
But I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint
Now I know that she's not like her and yet she might have been
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin

We took the night life off the streets and brought it in our own homes
While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell

If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now
And when you're in that jury room just remember there and then
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done

Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son
Now gentlemen that's my story my testimony stands
This girl is my own daughter and the case is in your hands

I wouldn't let my dear saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the lord I saw the light.

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that god gave back his sight
Praise the lord I saw the light.

Straight is the gate and narrow the way

Til I hear an old train
Rollin' down the line
Then I hurry straight
Home and pack
And if I didn't go
I believe I'd blow my stack
I love you baby
But you gotta understand
When the lord made me
He made a ramblin' man

Some folks might say
That I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle
Down if I could
But when that open road
Starts to callin' me

And writes my soul the message He wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine
When God dips His love in my heart

I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation when He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide
Such love as Jesus did impart

It makes me laugh and it makes me cry
Sets my sinful soul on fire

He walked every step up Calvary's ragged way
And He gave His life completely to bring a better day
My life was lost in sinned but in love He took me in

Hank Williams,"In the world's mighty gallery of pictures
Hang the scenes that're painted from life
There's pictures of love and of passion
And there's pictures of keys and of strife

There hung pictures of youth and of beauty
Of old age and a blushing young bride
They all hung on the wall but the saddest of all
Are the pictures from life's other side

Just a picture from life's other side
Someone has fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide
That might have been happy some day

There's a poor old mother at home
She's watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just a picture from life's other side

The first scene is that of a gambler
Who had lost all of his money at play
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day

It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
That's just a picture from life's other side

Now the last scene is that by the river
Of a heartbroken mother and baby
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver
On an outcast, soon no one will save

And yet she was once a true woman
She was somebody's darling and pride
God help her she leaps, oh there's no one to weep
It's just a picture from life's other side

Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?

Are you walkin', are you walkin'? Are you talkin', are you talkin'?
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?
Are you traveling in his light, every day and every night?
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?

When the time has come to go, will your robe be white as snow?
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?
Will he take you by the hand and lead you to that promised land?
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?

Are you walkin', are you walkin'? Are you talkin', are you talkin'?
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?
Are you traveling in his light, every day and every night
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?

Hank Williams,"Travelin' down a lonely highway
I knew not where the road would end
Not a penny in my pocket
All a lone without a friend
In a little country village
I met a man and he was blind
As I helped him cross the high-way
Oh! lord I cried thy burdens are greater than mine.

I can see the light of day
I need not feel my way
Yes, thy burdens are greater than mine.

Met a lad while on my travels
Tryin' hard to play the game
Though his leg was very crippled
And he could not speak his name
Yet, he smiled in understandin'
Though life to him had been unkind
And as I watched, I cried in sorrow
Oh! lord his burdens are greater than mine.

I can speak my name aloud
Make my way among the crowd
Yes, his burdens are greater than mine.

Just by chance I passed a graveyard
I saw a young man kneelin' there
In his hand, there were some roses
On his lips, there was a prayer
On a stone, these words were written
""Your soul is god's, your mem'ry mine""
And as I watched, I cried in sorrow
Oh! lord I see his burdens are greater than mine.",Thy Burderns Are Greater Than Mine

Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
For we got love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on a real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
And they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
And our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think they fell from the sky
They say that this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block...
Oh all around the house you can see little children play...
We're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33

I'll share my world with you
Ev'rything that I own

They're no good if I'm alone
Let me give you the sunshine
While it's fresh with morning dew

To share my world with you

Let me give you my two arms
They'll be reaching when you do

When I hold you near
But that's for the the few
Things you do
If my heart had windows
You'd see a heart
Full of love just for you.

By your side I will stay
Till we're old and gray
Well, I miss those
Young moments we knew

Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the
Love bump
Nobody thinks about it until one day it just pops up
It all started with a little bitty kiss on her muff
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the
Love bump

Well I was a Casanova a real lady killer they say
Until I got a cold sore one that would not go away
Yeah I tried ointment on it but nothing was working
For me

In an arbor by the side of the road

Where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
It was in those old brush arbors troubled souls found peaceful harbors

Many times I have departed from the way of life I started
In an arbor by the side of the road
But each time the devil's caught me I remembered what they taught me

What the final result would be
How I lived in fear of wakin' up each mornin'
Findin' that you're gone from me

For today was the one I hated to face

Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be

Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds

But not one word of Bible verse, not a scripture do you know

Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burdens light
Is to dust the family bible trades the wrong way for the right

But now you say we're through,
The love we shared is now a memory.
I had built a ship of dreams
And planned them all for you,
And now,
I guess,
What is to be will be.

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own,
Drifting out across the ocean blue.
I'll sail my ship alone,
Though all the sails you've torn,
And when it starts to sink
Then I'll blame you.

I'm just like a ship at sea
That's lost without a sail,
The dark clouds hide the sun from up above.
And even with these broken dreams
My heart will never fail,
For deep inside there's only one true love.

Drifting out across the ocean blue.
I'll sail my ship alone,

To take back home to you,
Hoping you would hear my s.O.S.

Hank Williams,"Next Sunday, darling is my birthday
A day that should be free from care
Best wishes and congratulations
But only sorrow fills the air

While friends are singing happy birthday
There'll be smile upon my face
But when they're gone, the smile will vanish
A broken heart will take it's place

Another year has come and gone now
The plans I made have gone a stray
The day that should be filled with laughter
Will only be another day

Is empty now without you dear
But in my dreams you're there beside me
So let me dream that you are here",Next Sunday Darling Is My Birthday
Hank Williams,"I traveled from Texas to old Louisanne
Through valleys, o'er mountains and plains
Both footsore and weary, I rested awhile
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

The fairest young maiden that I ever saw
Passed by as it started to rain
We both found a shelter beneath the same tree
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

We hid from the shower, an hour or so
She asked me, how long I'd remain?
I told her that I'd spend the rest of my days
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

I just couldn't tell her that I ran away
From jail on a West Texas plane
I prayed in my heart, I would never be found
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

Then one day a man put his hand on my arm
And said I must go west again
I left her alone without saying goodbye
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

Tonight as I sit here alone in my cell
I know that she's waiting in vain
I'm hoping and praying someday to return
To the banks of the old Pontchartrain

Why cross three thousand miles of rolling waves
Like many others, my darling was killed in action
That's why I'm here, I'm searching for his grave

That we should have admitted before
We were just victims of a half hearted love
So why should we try anymore?

The vows that we make are only to break
We drift like a wave from the shore
The kisses we steal we know are not real
So why should we try anymore?

The dreams that we knew can never come true
They're gone to return no more
False love like ours fades with the flowers
So why should we try anymore?

On the past let's close the door
And smile, don't regret but live and forget

He groaned upon on that tree 
Amazing pity grace unknown
And love beyond degree

At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light 
And the burden of my heart rolled away 
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day

And shut his glories in

Hank Williams,"During the North African Campaign, 
A bunch of soldier boys had been on a long hike. 
They arrived in a little town called Casino. 
The next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to church. 
A sergeant commanded the boys in church.

After the Chaplain read the prayer, the text was taken up next. 
Those of the boys that had a prayer book took them out. 
One boy had only a deck of cards, and he spread them out. 
The sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those cards."" 
After the service was over, 
The soldier was taken prisoner 
And brought before the Provost Marshall.

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man here?""
""For playing cards in church, Sir,"" was the response.
The Marshall asked the soldier, ""And what have you to say for yourself, son?""
""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier.
The Marshall stated, 
""I hope so, for if not I will punish you 
More than any man was ever punished.""
The soldier said, ""Sir, 
I have been on the march for about six months. 
I have neither bible nor a prayer book, 
But I hope to satisfy you, sir, with the purity of my intentions."" 
And with that, the boy started his story 

""You see, sir, when I look at the Ace, 
It reminds me that there is but one God.
And the deuce reminds me that the bible is divided into two parts: 
The Old and the New Testaments.
When I see the trey, I think of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
And when I see the four, I think of the four evangelists 
Who preached the Gospel: there was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
And when I see the five, 
It reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; 
There were ten of them: 
Five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out.
When I see the six, 
It reminds me that in six days God made this heaven and earth.
And when I see the seven, 
It reminds me that on the seventh day, God rested from his great work.
And when I see the eight, 
I think of the eight righteous persons that 
God saved when he destroyed the earth: 
There was Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives.
And when I see the nine, 
I think of the lepers our saviour cleansed, 
And that nine of the ten didn't even thank him.
When I see the ten, I think of the ten commandments 
That God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone.
When I see the King, 
It reminds me that there is 
But one King of Heaven, God Almighty.
And when I see the Queen, 
I think of the blessed Virgin Mary who is the Queen of Heaven.
And the Jack or Knave is the Devil.

When I count the number of spots in a deck of cards, 
I find 365, the number of days in a year.
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year.
There are four suits, the number of weeks in a month.
There are twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year.
There are thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter.

So you see, Sir, 
My deck of cards serves me as a bible, 
An almanac and a prayer book.""

""And friends, this is a true story. 
I know, I was that soldier.""",Deck of Cards
Hank Williams,"I've just been to heaven with someone so true I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the Bible like she used to do I dreamed about mama last night
She never close her eyes to sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away

We only knew she never slept and when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three

It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key
For always when we'd step inside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why

Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
She had to know we were safe before she went to rest 

For she seemed to fear the world might harm the ones 
She loved best and once she said when you have grown into woman and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care

That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called to gather roun her bed
The children're all with you now the kindly doctor said

And in her eyes there gleamed again that old time tender light
That told she'd been waitin just to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years tand 

Then she went to sleep

That the old-time religion was real

I said, ""it's commotion, that's all.""
""when they get down to pray, I'll just get up and leave

He didn't talk like he thought much of me.

Showed the blood stains of red

He gave back the silver

Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know

They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone, I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit an' cry
When the evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
'Till my body's just a shell
An' my hair turns whiter than snow

I'll never see that gal of mine
Lord, I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow",Lonesome Whistle
Hank Williams,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry",I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry
Hank Williams,"I got a feelin' called the blues, oh, Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh, Lord

That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy

Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all over, I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me

Lord, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leavin'
This is all I can say

I got a feelin' called the blues, oh, Lord

Go on and break your crazy heart
You lived on promises I knew would fall apart go on and break your crazy heart

On those damp satin sheets,
So I packed my things

And it's hotter than hell
And if I'm lucky I'll catch a ride,

I'd rather be here with the bugs and flies 
Than back there hearing your alibis
Heard all that I'm gonna hear you say, 
I'm gonna take my pride and go the other way

The hurt from all your lies

Lightning streaks across the evening sky
And if I'm lucky I'll make it big 
Or lay right down and die

I know when the morning comes 
I'm gonna be a walking son of a gun.

Hank Williams III,"I used to have a nice life
I used to live by the right
But I've strayed from the good side of the lord
And I flirted with the Devil and he dealt me a card

And he told me that you will never win
And he told me that I was his best friend
I had nothing to go home to
So I sold my soul to the Devil now I'm blue

Hank Williams III,"Early one mornin' while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head
Got up the next morning and I grabbed my gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
Laid in the hot joint, takin' the pill
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said ""Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown""
""You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""
Yes, oh yes my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
I shot her down 'cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

When I was arrested, I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
I had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my doddered carcass in that county jail
The next morning 'bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff comin' down the line
He kind of coughed as he cleared his throat
He said ""Come on you dirty hack, to the district court""
Entered the courtroom, and my trial began
Where I was held by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that dirty judge commence to look about

In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read ""In the first degree""
I hollered ""Lordy, Lordy have mercy on me!""
The judge smiled as he picked up his pen
""Ninety-nine years in the Folsom State Pen""
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen up to me
""Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be!""",Cocaine Blues

Quit watching women and TV

Might even smoke those cigarettes
Play my guitar like Dickey Betts
Get in miss Shania's pants

Singing my songs and trying to get paid
I've been roughed up, beat up, I've been cut 
I got a tattoo at a tender age
Never could respect a sherriff trying to break my neck
With a few friends and a can of mace
Born on the south-side with a lot of rebel pride 
I raised a lot of hell in my younger days

If the truth hurts bear it

Running hard running free never gonna catch me 
Driving too fast on a black top road
Loaded up, hammered back
I'll smack you with my tire jack 
You better walk away before I carry you home
Passing my pig sty, sleeping where the dogs lie 
Anywhere I go is where I call my home
Been stoned, been straight,
Been to hell and heaven.s gate 
I got thrown out 'cause they said I didn't belong

When a stranger appeared in a little town they called Dried Gulge
When he said I'm a rainmaker most of the folks just stood in doubt
But could he be the miracle sent Lord to end this awful drought
Things in old Dried Gulge happened then the same
Since the old rainmaker came to make it rain
Without a moments hesitation they all agreed the pay is fee
When he said for a thousand dollars boys I'll moss in your sandy sea
They gathered every penny from far and wide they came
To have a big celebration for tonight it was gonna rain

As he was preparin' his potion the hearts were filled with love
And every eye was fixed on those cloudly skies above
Hour after hour but no rain came down
And they caught the old rainmaker just as he was leavin' town
Yeah they hung the rainmaker beneath the dead oak tree
As he cried and he pleaded just wait wait and you're gonna see

"Hank Williams, Jr.","As I walked out in the streets of Laredo as I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen
Wrapped up in white linen as cold as the clay
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as a police stepped by
Come side down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the chest and I know I must die

It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay
First to the drum house and then to the courthouse
Got shot in the chest and I'm dying today

Oh beat the drum slowly play the fife lowly play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley there lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin get six pretty maidens to bear up my pall
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin but roses to deaden the sod as they fall
Then swing your ropes slowly and raddle your spurs lowly
And give a wild yell as you carry me along
And in the grave throw me and rove the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong
Go bring me some water a cup of cold water

To cool my parched lips the cowboy then said
Before I return his soul had departed and gone to the roundup the cowpoke was dead

We take him to the green valley there lay the sod o'er him

He loved every footstep, he loved every curl
But she went to heaven, just one year ago

He held and caressed it and gazed up above
He whispered, my baby, you're waiting, I know
I'll bring you, your dolly at the first fall of snow?

And I'm darn near down with the flu

The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

You have to set on a sack of fertilizer to raise an umbreller
And it rains out here nearly every day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

Up from the spring about a mile and a quarter

When it rains it wets everything we got

"Hank Williams, Jr.","A little girl prayed at the close of the day,
Cause her daddy had gone far away,
On her little face was a look of despair,
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer
My mommy says daddy has brought us to shame
And I'm never no more to mention his name
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand

You know friends I wonder
Just how many homes are broken tonight
And just how many tears are shed
By some little word of anger
That never should have been said

I'd like to tell you a story
Of a family I once knew.
We'll call them Mary and William
And their little daughter sue

Now Mary was just a plain mother
And bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family quarrels
(like everybody else)
But neither one really got mad

Then one day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word led to another
And the last word led to a divorce

Now here were two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense

You know she didn't ask to be brought to
This world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones it hurts the most

In this wicked ole world today
If just a few parted parents
Could hear little sue say

I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the Bible like she used to do
I dreamed about mama last night

She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away

We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key

For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight

She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm
The ones that she loved the best
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then

And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said

And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
And then she went to sleep

That it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind 
And this is what I heard my neighbor say:

She drinks and she talks quite a lot 
She knows not to speak to my child or to me.""

Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around.

Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.

Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him ""Don't stop.""

And soon it will wake this town that's made of dreams.

But before it does a new star will be shining

"Hank Williams, Jr.","There ain't too much chance for opportunity
In this town that I live in
And I don't know what I'm gonna do with me
And it's getting hard to contend
With the fact that I ain't going nowhere
If I don't get out of here
I need a change of luck and a pick-me-up
Something more than the bars and the beers

I need something to believe in
Something to look forward to
Something to believe in
Cause I got a bad case of the blues
Something to believe in
Something to make me feel right
Something to believe in
Is that asking too much out of life

Well I quit my job
And I'm leaving today
Cause two hundred a week, it don't make it
I got a ticket going to L.A.
And I'm hoping I can take it
Cause I got enough money for about a month before I'll be back on the bus
But I got faith in me and all new things I see
I just need a little good luck

Well I was getting down
Soon I'd have to leave town
And I was out walking the street
When I met a girl
By the burger world
And I was needing her company
By the way she was dressed
I knew what to expect
When we got to her motel room
Ah, but when she found out I came from her hometown
She starting crying and Lord I did too

I need something to believe in
Ah, baby something to look forward to
Ah, do you feel like I do
Something to believe in
She said please stay with me tonight
I want something to believe in
Just talk to me and hold me tight

She was just eighteen
And I couldn't believe
What had happen since she left home
I thought I had some pains
But it wasn't the same
As the hell she had known
So we packed our stuff
And we got on the bus
And now it's back to the same old grind
But if you could have seen
The way she looked at me
When she saw the city limit sign

We got something to believe in
Something to look forward to
Something to believe in
And I believe in me and you
Something to believe in
Holding each other tight
Something to believe in

"Hank Williams, Jr.","Now I met an old friend 
In the bar the other night
And he got a little drunk
And he wanted to fight
And he jumped up 
And challenged every man in the room
And just about the time he got the words out
An 'ol boy jumped up and closed his mouth
And used his head for a mop
And his butt for a broom

It was an attitude adjustment
I guess it was his first time 
An attitude adjustment
Now he understands just fine
He got bent out of shape
And he opened his mouth
And just one appointment 
Straightened him right out
It was an attitude adjustment
Oh It'll work every time 

Well I've got this big 'ol brother-in-law
And me and him just never did get along 
Because he wants to make sure 
I'm treating his sister right 
He got drunk one night 
And started beating me up
And I went and got a tire tool
Out of my truck
And laid him out as cold as a block of ice

It was an attitude adjustment 
And it will work every time 
An attitude adjustment
I made him see the light
And he says I'm his kind of man
And he comes around with his hat in his hand
It was an attitude adjustment
I cured all his family pride

Now my girlfriend slapped me in the face
I said darlin' that was you're first mistake
Then she went wild and her eyes turned red
She started breaking everything
And screaming loud
And kickin' me and cussin' me out
And I gave her a little adjustment 
On the top of the head

It was an attitude adjustment
Now she loves on me all the time 
Just an attitude adjustment
She got a whole new frame of mind 
She don't nag
And I don't beg 
And we get along and like I said 
Just an attitude adjustment
Oh everything's just fine 
Well almost

She called the cops to take me in
And I said you're never gonna do it friend
And they just smiled
And said ""Oh Yes We Will""
Now a stick to the head
And some kicks in the chin
And a several bites from Rin Tin Tin
And I couldn't wait to get into that jail

It was an attitude adjustment
Oh I went along peacefully

Oh they made me clearly see
Cause my head is black
And my legs are blue
And both knee caps are bent clean through

Had my guitar on my back.
When a stranger stopped beside
Me in an antique Cadillac.
He was dressed like nineteen fifty,
Half drunk and hollow eyed.
He said it's a long walk to Nashville, son would you like a ride?

I sat down in the front seat, he turned on the radio.
And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers,
Was solid country gold.

Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale,
When he asked me for a light.
And I knew there was something strange about this ride.

He said ""Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing,
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues,
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said ""Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside,
'cause if you'r big star bound let me warn ya it's a long hard ride.""

Then he cried just south of Nashville,
And he turned that car around.
He said ""This is where you get off boy,
Because I'm going back to Alabam.

I said mister many thanks,
He said ""you don't have to call me mister, mister,

And stay because they feel that no other man
Wants his woman but him, but listen

Who've had so many good men in life

Men who would go to work everyday and bring home
Their hard earned pay
Men who would give their women anything that their
Little heart desired

Where some women make mistakes
Is when their men go out and let 'em play
They would stay because they felt that no other
Woman wanted him but her, listen

If you think that no other woman wants him
Just pitch him out in the streets and you will see
Some woman will have your man before you can count

Says, ""I'm your biggest fan""

May he never sing the blues

I've needed a helpin' hand

And it ain't been so easy lately

I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday

I'd make my Supreme Court down in Texas
And we wouldn't have no killers getting off free
If they were proven guilty, then they would swing quickly
Instead of writin' books and smilin' on TV

We'd all learn Cajan cookin' in Louisiana
And I'd put that capital back in Alabama
We'd put Florida on the right track, 'cause we'd take Miami back
And throw all them pushers in the slammer

Oh, if the south woulda won, we woulda had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day young Skynyrd died, we'd show our southern pride
If the south woulda won, we woulda had it made
""Play a little dixieland boys, ah yes""

I'd have all the whiskey made in Tennessee
And all the horses raised in those Kentucky hills
The national treasury would be in Tupelo, Mississippi
And I'd put Hank Williams picture on one hundred dollar bill

I'd have all the cars made in the Carolinas
And I'd ban all the ones made in China
I'd have every girl child sent to Georgia to learn to smile
And talk with that southern accent that drives men wild

I'd have all the fiddles made in Virginia
'Cause they sure can make 'em sound so fine
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain and see ole Clifton Clowers
And have a sip of his good ole Arkansas wine

Thought Amos was a hell of a man

Was in the swamp hutnin' alligator skin

There's a sadness in my heart, many thoughts to think
A letter to be written, things should be said
I stare out my window, and it starts to rain

Now how should I put this for you to see
Never wanted to hurt you, just believe in me
But I was misleaded, burned my fingers in fire
Now you feel mistreated, now I feel like a liar

We used to love each other forever more
You think we should still bother or let it go
See I'm a hard luck woman and you're not a lucky star
Though we messed it up now, let's get back to the start

You enjoy your freedom, or so they say
But your eyes aren't shining like yesterday
Now the odds are against me, I just wanna try
The flame's still burning deep inside

You used to call me baby, not anymore
Now you call me a cheater, I know the score
Yes I'm a hard luck woman, but you're not a stone cold man
I'm not quitting on this while I still can
I know I'm your woman, you know you're my man

Everyone has a dream, every play has a scene
Every night, every day is a lifetime
Every joyce, every voice tears apart my heart
All the days of my life I've waited
And the hope never has really faded

We used to love each other, we know we do
So maybe we should bother and stop playing a fool
I'll be your hard luck woman, would you be my hard luck man
The flame's still burning, just take my hand
I know I'm your woman, you know you're my man

Hannah Fury,"Solitude still holds you
I don't have to fake the blues
And all you want is refuge
Sugar is the heart's food

Sugar is the heart's food
Fathers don't know all the rules
Kicked around, I know you know the cruelty of love
And if you could have just one thing for your birthday, what would it be?

Maybe that one wrong word would not make you bad
And you could say just how you feel
And they would still want you around
And maybe that you could make mistakes

And that it would still be okay
And they would still want you around
Thoughts are often ridiculed
Feelings often misunderstood

And all you do is rescue one little piece of your heart
And feed it sugar
And it will grow
So powerful and strong

You won't know what to do with all the warmth
You won't even remember all the harm
And it will be so much easier to lead
The life you always wanted

The life you always should have had",Sweet Heart
Hannah Fury,"The light in your eyes beckons to me
It beckons so quietly, but I hear it clearly
You start walking towards me
Taking my breath and fearlessly setting me free

Oh, I feel it being drawn out
The blood flowing steadily into your mouth
This dark night, cruel and cold
You whisper softly, ""Honey, you'll never grow old""

Looking back at the crowd
Back at the party
I step outside and disappear swiftly
Oh, I feel it being drawn out

The pain of life fading, going down south
Lost in the wake of my wedding
And caught here at these old crossroads
I can never leave

I think I've been fooled
Why am I not dressed in white?
With eyes full of glory and wine
I'll be your eternal bride

I'll be here forever
Here, on this night
Why am I not dressed in white?
I need you near me

I think I've been fooled
I need you near me
I think I've been fooled
You carry me over the crossroads

And I'm lost on this cold, dark night
Why am I not dressed in white?
I carry a mandrake in my bouquet
And I shiver when it screams

I carry a mandrake in my bouquet
And I shiver when it screams
The light in your eyes is still calling to me
Taking my whole world and setting it spinning

Knowing my weakness, the spark lies in the sand
Taking my hand, you lead me into the dance
Oh, I feel it being drawn out
My soul is rushing right into your mouth

How could you take me away from the party?
I think I've been fooled
How could you take me away from the party?
I think I've been fooled

I need you near me
I think I've been fooled
I carry a mandrake in my bouquet
And I shiver when it screams

I need you near me
I think I've been fooled
I carry a mandrake in my bouquet
And I shiver when it screams

With eyes full of lust and light
I'll be your eternal bride
I'll be here forever
Here, on this night

Oh, why am I not dressed in white?

Will the light spark?",The Vampire Waltz

True love will find you in the end
You'll find out just who was your friend
Don't be sad, I know you will,
But don't give up until
True love will find you in the end
This is a promise with a catch
Only if you're looking can it find you
'Cause true love is searching too
But how can it recognize you
Unless you step out into the light?
Don't be sad I know you will
But don't give up until
True love finds you in the end.

La da a da
Don't get me wrong,
I love who I am
I don't wanna be ungrateful
It probably sounds strange

I really love the role I play
The songs I sing
But with all the fame
The things that seem so simple
Suddenly, so far out of reach
Wish that they could see
That underneath

I'm just an ordinary girl!
Sometimes I'm lazy
I get bored, I get scared,
I feel ignored, I feel happy
I get silly, I choke on my own words.
I make wishes, I have dreams,
And I still want to believe,
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl!

Like you like me

How are you?
Hello, goodbye
One day here,
One day there
And again it's time to go

Strike a pose for the front

Everywhere, I arrive I get
High five's
They paint me larger than life

Or nothin' at all
Get back on your feet
When you stumble and fall
A little luck can go a long way
So don't you worry about
What people say
Who knows where the wind may blow

I wake up to find
I always dream the same.
Every night I come to my window
When you call my name

You say just fall like rain

When you ask ""do you wanna dance, my barefoot Cinderella""
Don't need no slippers or a party dress,
The way you're lookin' right

Say ""do you wanna take a chance?
Stay with me forever
No one will ever be more beautiful
My barefoot, my barefoot Cinderella.""

Then I smile at your picture sitting next to my bed
Sunset and you're feeling okay
'Cause you smiled at the letter that I sent you today
And I can't wait 'til I see you again
And we'll both say remember when
The band played on the 4th of July
And you held me on your shoulders way up high

You're still there for me, wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright
I believe that you were listening to my song
You're with me
You've been here all along

You've been here all along

Back then, you walked me to school
Told me to be careful and I followed the rules
Fast forward, you taught me to drive
You gave me the keys and we went for a ride
And I can't wait 'til I see you again
And we both say remember when
I'm holding on to moments like that
And I know that they're coming back

You're still there for me, wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright
I believe that you were listening to my song
You're with me
You've been here all along

Yeah,
All along the way, I keep you in my heart and in my prayers
You'll always be the one who cares the most
Counting on the day I see you running out to say
I missed you, I missed you

You're still there for me, wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright
I believe that you were listening to my song

You're still there for me, wherever there might be

With so much joy but so much pain

You always let me be me

Hanne Hukkelberg,"He still held my hand in his thread
His head filled with helium
Pulled me up so I couldn't walk
But look at things from a different angle

To hang on to my balloon
And to be shown a glimpse of the truth
Made my cheek flush and my mouth smile
My chest's like a cage full of butterflies
It tickled and I laugh:
”such a rare, rare joy”

Suddenly the balloon loosened itself, he said:
“I have to move further on, I'll keep on flying
Keep on showing the truth from my point of view,”

Leaving the shore in a boat of wood
Sailing, sailing on, all alone

Not the urge to blow away
Not the urge to travel far

As her helpers, they stayed as her hosts

And to set them free

Start to dig up their cold and frozen souls
You'll see that far underneath
There's a soul you can take
With you into the spring

White and burying snow slowly, slowly
Laid the woods to sleep
Everything is lying still
Until somebody wakes them

All the rays will come visit you now

With just fingers and a palm
I'd hunt a dust through a gentle breeze

I was a lonely hunter
Bow and arrow on my back
I couldn't see, had to count on my heart

I tried the best I could
But got lost in the woods
Searched all night, but couldn't see
But now that I can see

Faces are visible
It grows a flower in
Tell me it is true love!

Close To The Edge

I. The Solid Time Of Change
Anderson/Howe

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,
And take away the plain in which we move,
And choose the course you're running.

Down at the edge, round by the corner,
Not right away, not right away.
Close to the edge, down by a river,
Not right away, not right away.

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,
Reaching to call the color of the sky.
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.
Getting over all the time I had to worry,
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.

Down at the end, round by the corner.
Close to the edge, just by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.
Now that it's all over and done,
Now that you find, now that you're whole.

II. Total Mass Retain
Anderson/Squire

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armoured movers took approach to overlook the sea.
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.

Down at the edge, close by a river.
Close to the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by the corner.
Down at the edge, round by the river.

Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory.
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.

Down at the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.

III. I Get Up, I Get Down
Anderson/Howe

In her white lace
You can clearly see the lady sadly looking.
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain.

I get up, I get down,
I get up, I get down.
Two million people barely satisfy.
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.
The eyes of honesty can achieve.
How many millions do we deceive each day?

[Thru the duty she would coil their said
Amusement of her story asking only interest
Could be laid upon the children of her domain]

I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

In charge of who is there in charge of me.
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page.
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

IV. Seasons Of Man
Anderson/Howe

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems.
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.
Ah, ah.

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past.
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.

Close to the edge, down by the river.
Down at the end, round by the corner.
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that it's all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun.
Now that you find, now that you're whole.
Seasons will pass you by,
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.


And You And I

I. Cord Of Life
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream.
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Coins and crosses

Turn round tailor, assaulting

Never know their fruitless worth;

all the mornings of the interest shown,

presenting one another to the cord,

Cords are broken,

All left dying, rediscovered

Of the door that turned round,

Locked inside the mother earth.

To close the cover, all the

interest shown,

They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you,

To turn one another, to the sign at the time float your climb.

Watching the world, watching all of the world,

Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.

II. Eclipse
Anderson/Bruford/Squire

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
As a movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the side of seeds of life with you.

III. The Preacher the Teacher
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme.
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify;
Political ends, as sad remains, will die.
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.
Ooh, ooh.

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me.
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same.
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
As a moment regained and regarded both the same,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you.

IV. Apocalypse
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning.
And you and I reach over the sun for the river.
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement.
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.


Siberian Khatru
Anderson/Howe/Wakeman

Sing, bird of prey;
Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right on over my head.

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming.
Cold reigning king,
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right over the outboard, river,
Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time.
Dude'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah.

Hold down the window;
Hold out the morning that comes into view.
Warm side, the tower;
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru.

Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit.
Cold reigning king,
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement.
River running right on over my head

Outboard, river.

Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time,
Suntower, asking,
Cover, lover,
June cast, moon fast,
As one changes,
Heart gold, leaver,
Soul mark, mover,
Christian, changer,
Called out, saviour,
Moon gate, climber,
Turn round, glider.

Hans Annéllsson,"Onward I walk, 
Alone and abandoned

Feeling the wind and the icy cold rain
Feeling each step, destiny hidden 
All to aware of the fear and the pain
Feeling the sting of true betrayal 
Now I have no one to trust but myself
I am now one, no more believer 
Yet there is still wind to fill my sail

A paradise I seek shall be found 
The only one I'll know
I challenge failure to cut me down 
Cause it's onward I shall go
My power strength shall never die
As long as I stay alive
One word shall always be by my side 
Ever moving onward!!!!

Battles I've won, 
The war I have lost 
My blood and my tears 
They are equally spilled
The risk I shall take, 
The feel of the cost
The prophecies of shattered dreams 
Now fulfilled
The specters they watch, 
I can hear them laugh 
Yet I will impale onto their doubting eyes
Victory due one of these days 
Revenge will silently 
Come all in due time

Onward on, never underestimate my force of will
Onward on, never I will hesitate to know 
That I will fight!!

Onward I walk, with each step now close
But closer to something that might not be there
Using the rage, feeling the hunger 
The book that I read always has a new page
Come strike me down, take all that you need 
Resilience is my new found weapon of choice
Again I will rise, one day I will win
As long as I sing onward cry from my voice!!",Onward

The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
Around the south side so cold that we cried
Were we ever colder on that day 
A million miles away

Move forward was my friend's only cry
In deeper to somewhere we could lie
And rest for the the day with cold in the way
Were we ever colder on that day 
A million miles away
It seemed from all eternity

The moments seemed lost in all the noise
A snow storm a stimulating voice
Of warmth of the sky of warmth when you die
Were we ever warmer on that day 
A million Miles away
We seemed from all eternity

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la

Standing in the sunlight laughing

Hansel,"Amigos conocí a una mujer tan preciosa 
Que por bella le di una rosa tiene los ojos azules 
Tan lindos como un reflejo del mar 
Ayer caminando por una avenida 
Al parar de repente en la esquina 
Besé sus labios sentí que era mía aquella linda mujer 
Ya llevo seis meses saliendo con ella es tan fácil de amar 
Todas las noches la llevo conmigo a pasear 
Y la regreso temprano a su casa para que pueda soñar 
Ella es tan frágil tan dulce inocente 
Sin ninguna maldad esta llena de amor 
De cariño y de sinceridad 
Lo mejor que he tenido en mi vida lo puedo jurar 

Amigo esa mujer a quien dices que amas 
Es quien devora mi cuerpo en la cama 
Una tigresa vestida de seda hambrienta por mí 
Ella hace el amor como una salvaje 
Y en cuanto al sexo ella es una insaciable 
Me tiene el cuerpo gastado y cansado de tanto querer 
Ella hace tiempo es mi amante prohibida 
El placer ilegal ni me atrevo ni puedo 
Ni quiero de sus garras escapar 
Es un vicio que llevo en mis venas que no puedo evitar 
Ella la que aparenta ser dulce 
Inocente sin ninguna maldad 
Es la fiera que llena mi vida de felicidad 
Ha logrado envolver a los dos ja que casualidad 

Amigos me alegro tanto que hayan hablado 
Atentamente a los dos he escuchado 
Ahora les pido que escuchen muy bien lo que voy a decir
Después de tanto tiempo de estar separados 
Quiero decirles que al fin me he casado 
Con una dama que un día muy lejos de aquí conocí
Yo imagine que algo estaba pasando cuando un día la vi 
Caminando de brazos de otro presente hoy aquí 
Es difícil tener que aceptarlo la vida es así 
Ella la que es tu novia tan dulce y tu amante 
Hambrienta de placer la que en las tardes 
A oscuras a ustedes logro enloquecer 
Hace años la hice mi esposa 
Ella es mi mujer 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
Fingiendo cariño se apoderó de mi 
Y yo la hice feliz sin saber la realidad 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
En la vida a veces se dan esos casos 
Esa mujer me dejó con el alma hecha pedazos 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
Jamás pude imaginar que con mis buenos amigos 
Ella me fuera a engañar 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
Mordí sus labios acaricie su cuerpo moreno 
Y a mi pobre corazón embriagó de su veneno 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
Ella jura que nos quiere que sin nuestro amor se muere 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
En tiempos de antaño fue mi gran querer 
De ahora en adelante mas nunca en mi vida yo la quiero ver",Por Ella

Hanson,"It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere
Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
From the look on his face and the size of his toes
He comes from a place that nobody knows

Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day

He says where he's from is called Albertane
There they use more than 10% of the brain
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave
They run around in underwear and they never shave

Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird
Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird

For the love of Pete come in!
This is Baby Bird...sorry I was watching Court TV
Do you copy? Do you copy?
Of course we copy...24 hours a day...in color

You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest
The man sitting by me who was barely dressed
Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane

I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee
I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie
I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday
I know they'll come get me and take me away
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday
If not tomorrow then maybe today",[Silence]
Hanson,"The day that I left Lucy
A tear fell from her eye
Now I don't have nobody
And I was such a fool
On the day that I left Lucy
The day that I left Lucy
She cried, then said goodbye

Now it's done and it's over and I am all alone
On the day that I left Lucy
Now I don't have anymore songs to sing
'Cause you're everything, everything to me
I don't realize I felt this way until the day

I hope she is
Now I don't have nobody and no one will ever replace

Hope that you remember me next year
Hey Jamie, you've been a great friend to me
I hope that I'll still see you around here

'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook
Then I find that empty space
There's a name without a picture
But I can't forget his face

Tell me, where did he go?
I want to know
Where did Johnny go?
It says ""picture unavailable"" right here
More than sad
It makes me mad to know somebody knows
There's a lying in your silence
Tell me, where did Johnny go?

Poor Katie, she won't even speak his name
None of us will ever be the same
It's quiet in the halls
But I hear echoing off the walls
The rumors of Johnny's mystery
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook
Then I find that empty space
No, he never wrote me nothing
But I can't forget his face

Tell me, where did he go?
I want to know
Where did Johnny go?

It makes me mad to know somebody knows

Tell me, where did Johnny go?
Oh, there's a lying in your silence
Tell me, where did Johnny go?

Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name
Sometimes I wonder if maybe we're to blame
It's been a year now and a lot of things have changed
But I keep thinking about Johnny
I keep turning to that page

Where did he go?

And can you tell me the story of the soldier?

Lived a boy who had so many toys
And he didn't know what to do with them all
With them all, with them all
Well, his favorite of all the toys
Were the tin soldiers, the tin soldiers
And the one that he loved the most
Was the one with the missing leg

At night the toys would come alive
Or that's how the story is told
And there they met the soldier
With the missing leg
And the ballerina with the heart of gold
At night they would share each others dreams
Under the stars shining bright
But they were too shy
To speak of love, to speak of love

One day the boy sat them on the windowsill
To watch for the enemy coming over the hill
But when the wind it blew
It knocked him into the street
And the boys from the town they said
Won't you look at the one-legged soldier?
Let's stick him in a boat and send him far away
'Cause we can't find a use
For a soldier with a missing leg

And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend
He was so lonely, yeah

As he floated past a river rat
On his homemade boat
Well, the boat began to sink
And he sank to the bottom of the river
He got swallowed by a fish
Caught by a fisherman
Sold to the family of the boy who had the toys

And the cook said, look at the one-legged soldier
It looks just like the one we lost the other day
Could this be the boy's tin soldier with the missing leg?

But he was lonely, so lonely for a friend, oh
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend
He was so lonely, yeah
Oh yeah so lonely, oh yeah

What about the ballerina?

As he sat on the mantle piece to dry from the river
The ballerina who held his heart sat at his side
And when they got up to dance with each other
She fell by the fire blazing bright
When he jumped to save her from the flames
Their bases began to melt into one and the same
And now they share each other's destiny
Together forever they will be

And they are no longer lonely for a friend
And they are no longer lonely for a friend
No longer lonely, yeah
No longer lonely
Whoa, whoa
Yeah, whoa
No longer lonely, yeah

I want you to go on living your life
I'm not sleeping an endless sleep, oh
'Cause in your heart
You have all of our good times
Oh, all of our good times
Oh, oh, you have

And if I'm gone when you wake up
Don't ask why
Don't look back at this time
As a time of heartbreak and distress
Remember me, remember me

If you're ever lonely you can call on me 
I'll be here for you all you've got to do is call 
I'm always waiting here for you 
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through 

For so many years I have been your friend 
And we've through everything time and time again 
But I want you to know that I still believe in you 
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through 

You've gotta keep trying even though the road gets hard 
You've gotta keep going on even though he broke your heart 
And if you ever need a friend I will be here for you 
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through

Hanson,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

Sitting beside me was a man with no hair

He comes from a place that nobody knows

Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day

He says where he's from is called Albertane
There they use more than ten percent of the brain
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave
They run around in underwear and they never shave

Do you still love me like you did before?

We've lived in the shadows, but doesn't everyone?
Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes?

Weird, oh ho

Isn't it hard
Standing in the rain?
You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain
No one can hear, but you're screaming so loud
You feel like you're all alone in a faceless crowd
Isn't it strange how we all get a little bit weird sometimes?

Waiting for a sign
Hoping that my luck will change
Reaching for a hand that can understand someone who feels the same
When you live in a cookie-cutter world, being different is a sin
So you don't stand out
But you don't fit in

Hoping that my luck will change

[Chorus]

I'm gonna ask you once again
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?

Do you love me, do you love me?

Hanson,"The wind--it blows through the trees
Claiming those innocent leaves
And the thunder rolls these crashing seas
Like a tender kiss holds this heart in me

[Chorus]
In this lifelong love song
You can love right, you can love wrong
In this love song, you can love wrong
But if you love wrong, it doesn't mean love's gone

Mary was a young girl with a young girl's heart
And all I can remember is I loved her from the start
I was hers forever, she was mine too
But something's wrong 'cause now she's gone
Tell me, what did I do?

[Chorus]

Oh, and it doesn't mean love's gone
Just because you're feeling low
And it doesn't mean love's gone 
'Cause you feel like you want to let go
See, no one wrote in this book of love 
That we'd always know
I wish someone would have told me before

We talked about love a million times it seems
The words come out of our lips
Like we forget what it means
And we said we'd be together till death do us part
But we said those words with only half our hearts

[Chorus]

I wish someone would have told me
I wish someone would have told me before",Love Song
Hanson,"And I've waited for you 
And I've waited for you 

Just a picture and a feeling and your face 
How could I forget your touch, your warm embrace? 
And the shoes you wore were long black satin lace 
As you walked into my mind

As you walked into this old forgotten hall 
And just when looking I began to fall 
I wish I could frame you and this feeling on the wall 
To stare at till there is no time, oh 

And I've waited for you 
Just hopin' that you'll come back to me 
And I've waited for you 

Run, run, runaway, run 
Maybe someday I will find somewhere to (run) 
Run, runaway 
Maybe someday, maybe someday 

From a distance I watched the flowers brush your cheek 
As you read the words I wrote, I couldn't speak 
But now I lay here, broken heart and blistered feet 
As you're spinning 'round my mind, oh 

And I've waited for you 
Just dreamin' that you're coming to me 
And I've waited for you 

Run, run, runaway, run 
Maybe someday I will find somewhere to (run) 
Run, runaway 
Maybe someday, maybe someday, yeah, maybe someday 

When you weep, you can know that it's all right 
As I sleep, I can follow you; it's all right 
We can talk just as long as you hold on tight 
Just one breath is a million sights

I can tell every breath that you're breathing 
I can feel it--the thoughts that you're thinking 
We can talk till a thousand years go by 
You and I, yeah

Hanson,"Loving you like I never have before
I'm needing you to open up the door
If begging you might somehow turn the tides
Then tell me to I've got to get this off my mind

I never thought I'd be speaking these words
I never thought I'd need to say
Another day alone is more than I can take

Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need
I just want to be by your side
Won't you save me, I don't want to be
Just drifting through the sea of life

Listen please, don't walk out the door
I'm on my knees, you're all I'm living for

I never thought I'd be speaking these words
Heaven thought I'd find a way
Another day alone is more than I can take

Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need
I just want to be by your side
Won't you save me, I don't want to be
Just drifting through the sea of life

Suddenly the sky is falling
Could it be it's too late for me
If I never said I'm sorry, then I'm wrong, I'm wrong

Then I hear my spirit calling
Wondering if she's longing for me
And then I know that I can't live without her

Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need
I just want to be by your side
Won't you save me, I don't want to be
Just drifting through the sea of life

Won't you save me
Won't you save me

Hanson,"It's getting colder in this ditch where I lie
I'm feeling older and I'm wondering why
I heard they told her it was tell and live or die
I didn't know her, but I know why she lied
I didn't know her, but I know why she died

You can't say I didn't give it
I won't wait another minute

And we won't go down

Well, I feel ashamed of the things that I've said
Put on these chains and you can live a free life
Well, I'd rather bleed just to know why I die

You can't say I didn't give it
I won't wait another minute

This time around

Give in to the given and put out the light
Cannons a-blazin' shower these moonlit skies
Then I remember and I know why he died
Do you know why I die?

I can feel you read my mind 
I can see it in your eyes under the moon as it plays 
Like music every line 
There's a rug with bleeding dye under the fan in the room 
Where the passions burning high by the chair 
With the leopard skin under the light 
It's always Penny and me tonight 

On the plane step up with both my feet 
Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to NYC 
Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat 
Catch the view and another good book to read 
Sitting at home over the friendly skies 
Missing her eyes 
It's always Penny and me tonight 

'Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down 
Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground 
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies 
Close our eyes, pretend to fly 
It's always Penny and me tonight 

Staring at a million city lights 
But it's still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky 
Feel the wind brushing slowly by 
If I could soar I'd try to take these wings and fly 
Away to where the leaves turn red 
But no matter where I am instead 
Singing along to feeling alright 
Or making it by under pink moonlight 
It's always Penny and me tonight 

'Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down 
Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground 
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies 
Close our eyes, pretend to fly

Penny dreams of rainy days and nights up late by the fireplace 
And aimless conversations about the better days

What is that supposed to mean 
What am I supposed to be 

I pull my way up through this crowd 
To find your body crushed on the ground 
It's so obvious; why couldn't you see
That you can't go high-flying 
Without a pair of high-flyer wings?

Little one's broken lying on the ground 
Trying to get up 'till his last breath out 
Wings are strewn everywhere; there's blood all around 
'Cause even angels die, but that light just fades 
It's so sad, but he'd be so proud

Scenarios to add to your hypocrisy

Hanson,"Waking up this morning
Thinking this can't be real
They say there is nothing love can't heal
Why don't you come on down
So you can feel what I feel?

Sitting all alone in this place
Even though we're here face to face
There is nothing gone
But there's something wrong

Can't you see
That I'm stuck here underneath
And you make it hard to breathe?
Take a look around and tell me what you see
You'll find me underneath

I know what to say
But don't know where to begin
I fear I'm losing you beneath my skin
Is there resolution for this pain that I'm in?

Sitting all alone in this place
Even though we're here face to face
There is nothing gone
But there's something wrong

Can't you see
That I'm stuck here underneath
And you make it hard to breathe?
Take a look around and tell me what you see
You'll find me underneath
'Cause you'll find me, whoa, underneath

If only you could feel what I dream
Maybe you could hear what I mean
There is nothing gone

But there's something missing
Can't you see
That I'm stuck here underneath
And you make it hard to breathe?

And I feel the bridges burning 
Underneath my feet

Where do you go, oh 
When you're gone?
Where do you go, oh 
When you're gone?
Oh, how the road feels so long 
But where do you go, oh

I just want to stay dreaming 
No, I just don't want to wake 
Why can't we keep on sailing 
Across this emerald lake?
My forehead is still bleeding 
From the thorns I used to wear 
And I'm left alone and beaten 
For this cross I choose to bear

Though the road's still long and the light is still far

Though the road's still long and the light is still far 
But I finally found what I'm looking for

And the fear it pours like rain 
And my heart is crushed to cinders

When the revolution's dead 
So I'm left with no solution 
For the voices in my head

Hanson,"You who are on the road
Must have a code that you can live by
And so become yourself
Because the past is just a good-bye

Teach your children well
Their father's hell
Will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they pick
The one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you
And know they love you.

And you, of tender years
Don't know the fears
That your elders grew by
So please help them with your youth
They seek the truth
Before they can die.

(Can you hear and do you care
And can't you see we must be free
To teach our children what you believe in
Make a world that we can believe in.)

Teach your parents well
Their children's hell
Will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they pick
The one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you
And know thay love you
And know thay love you.

Where nothing is seen

And high on the walk

He waits for the slow of the breeze
Oh, wow, look at him now on his feet
High up in the sky

And every moment extends endlessly
It feels as though time isn't moving
And every second, one breath not to breathe
I watch as he moves to the beat

Well, I'm on the floor
I watch from my seat
I watch as he sways with the trees
And slowly he moves, but so elegantly
I'm more on the edge of my seat 

On the tightrope
Everything's bare
All that there is is from here to there
On the tightrope
The goal is quite clear
Don't lose yourself in your fear 

Everyone waits on the walk
Some are long and some small 
But all of them tall
Everyone must make a choice
Will I go for it all and possibly fall?
The tightrope is thin
I could possibly win on the walk 

Well, high on the walk
The tightrope it bends
And nobody knows where it ends
To win or to lose
You're all on your own

Hanson,"I don't feel myself today
Just a figure in a big monopoly game

I'm sinking but I'm floating away
Throw me a line so I can anchor my pain
The fabric is about to fray

Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately

Things keep coming and I keep stumbling
I start feeling I'm strong enough to break
Oh, I start feeling I'm strong enough to break

Been running through my mind today
Scenarios to add to your hypocrisy
No one ever takes the blame
But everyone is searching for a cure to the pain
Nothing ever seems to change
Oh, nothing ever seems to change
We just play like broken records in a deaf mans charade

I'm feeling older and I'm wondering why

I didn't know her but I know why she lied

You can't say I didn't give it
I won't wait another minute
We're on our way this time around

And we won't go down

I heard them say that dreams should stay in your head
Well I feel ashamed of the things that I've said
Put on these chains and you can live a free life
Well I'd rather bleed just to know why I die

Then I remember and I know why he died

People down town know
And a beat rhythm on the radio
And the girl who listens to a young mans song
On the block I live on

Well the young man sitting
On the dock of the bay
He took a long-term trip on a first class plane
Now the whole world listens
To that one mans song
On the block I live on

Tell me does it move you
Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll
Does it move you
Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart
And soul with the roots of rock and roll

Well the man in black sits
On a screened in porch
Making birthday wishes, 71 almost
You can hear him singing chariot
Swing low
On the block I live on
In the place I know

Tell me does it move you
Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll
Does it move you
Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart and soul with the

My body's tired and broken
I want a taste of something, that doesn't leave me dry
This hope for answered questions
As rare as true conviction
I stare into the distance, there is no truth in sight
Who can tell me why

Everybody's looking for a blue sky
Searching for an answer on a satellite
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see
A blue sky waiting for me

I've seen the main attraction
I've felt the moment's passion
I won't be no soap box teacher, just taking your time
Just taking your time
Who can tell me why

Everybody's looking for a blue sky
Searching for an answer on a satellite
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see

A fleet of vessels made of wood so they won't rust
But can we see the bottom of the bottle when we start to drink?

Nobody else is gonna save you
You're pretty uptight to be downtown

And I waited!
Waited for something to arrive
Gotta keep this beat alive
But it keeps me satisfied
And I waited!
Waited for something to be real

Where do we go from here?
The future's so unclear
You're such a doll, my dear

Well there's nothing wrong with the way you look
but you've been acting like you're up to no good.
You playing me like I've got nothing to lose.
You better keep in line.
I'm not gonna get off until the last stop.
Nobody else is gonna save me.
Turn the heat up for the meltdown.

When all the pushin' up the hill has brought you here

Did she tease you for your flirty quips
Did she leave you frozen with the wrong words chosen
You gotta show her why she can't resist
Make her blush now, you put your hands on her hips
She's gonna keep on playing until you stop chasing
So wrap your arms around her body, tell her all she needs to know

Give a little heart and soul
Let your body lose control
Give a little oh oh oh
Give a little
Wrap your arms around

You gotta show her when she can't decide
You gotta hold her, with that look in your eyes
When you move in close take your time
Leave an empty shoulder, let her move in closer
And wrap your arms around her body, tell her all she needs to know

Give a little heart and soul

Ich fickte deinen Vater schon damals
Als ich tickend im Park saß mit glitzerndem Spaßgras

Und ich schlug auf ihn ein ohne Ablass

Ich mach dein' Körper zum Tatort von schlimmen Dingen
Klingen, die in dich dringen (yallah, Hany, finish him!)
Du Verräter, hier gibt's kein Happy End
Ya Sippi, wir sind nicht im Fernseher
Du kriegst mehr Schläge als ein arschgefickter Baseball
Mal sehen, was Verräterknochen hergeben
Hurensohn, Punkt - deine Initialen
Du kennst den Grund, warum wir unsere Klingen in dich jagen
Frag mal meine Jungs, was sie zu Verrätern sagen
Tritte in den Magen, paar mal schlitzen, dann vergaben, also

Ich muss in Kauf nehmen, dass ich draufgeh' , erzähl mir nichts von Liebe
Denn hier draußen gibt es Tausend, wenn sie reden, dich betrügen
Egal ob Frauen oder Feinde oder sogenannte Brüder
Zwischen hassen und lieben ist die Grenze ziemlich dünn
Du wirst verlassen, könntest platzen wegen Ängsten in dir drin
Stark bleiben, denn auf einmal macht das Leben wieder Sinn
In harten Zeiten wachsen Werte plus die Stärke in dir drin
Es ist nicht einfach, auf keinen Fall, doch wer hat das behauptet
Immer weiter, vielleicht kommt dann ein Tag wo alles aufgeht
Falls du scheiterst, versuch es weiter, solang bis es klappt

Yeah I'm thinking 'cause deep in I'm sinking
I'm looking at death and I ain't even blinkin'
Smoking and drinking, partying hard
I'm around all these devils, but my body is gone
My spirit is good, but my mind is fucked
'Cause I wanna spread love, but the Nine is tucked
I know a bunch of dead men who will line them up
So I keep the circle tight and I fire it up ghost! Out!

Wir waren jeden Tag zusammen
Ich hab' geträumt, ich bleib' mein Leben lang am Ball
Aber da das Leben nun mal kein Wunschkonzert ist
Kommt es hundertfach vor, dass ein Traum einfach zerbricht
So viele Pläne, noch mehr Probleme
Nichts machte mir mehr Freude, als gegen dich zu treten
Ich zerlegte mich im Training für'n Stammplatz am Samstag
Volle Kampfkraft, für die Mannschaft, Immer (Immer)
Dieser Junge liebt dieses Spiel
Du siehst ihn lachen wenn er dribbelt über Wiese, wie'n Wiesel
Antäuschen, tunneln und dann schießen
Ja man Tor ich liebe es zu siegen
Seine Welt ist der Fußballplatz
Er fühlt sich im Turbogang über links so wie Superman
Übersteiger, antritt, Flanke 
Oder reinziehen und hau ihn direkt selber unter Latte

Ich liebe meinen Ball

Ich brauch' nur meinen Ball

Ich liebe meinen Ball

Ich hab scharf mit dir geschossen auf der Straße zwischen Blocks, wenn
Immer ich nur konnte war ich ganze zeit am zocken(Ja man!)
Und dank der bösen linken Klebe
Siehst du öfters den Ball im Winkel kleben
Jedes Wochenende war die Vorfreunde riesig, denn 
Tore zu schießen war meine erste große Liebe
Ich werd' dich immer wieder kriegen (immer)
Egal in welchem Garten du auch fliegst
Unter welchem Auto du auch liegst, ich brauche doch nur dich!
Und bleib diszipliniert, denn ein Raucher schafft es nicht
Du brauchst tausendfachen biss (ja man!)
Um zu schaffen was du schaffen willst
Denn da draußen gibt es Kids die nicht anders haben in ihr'm Leben
Alles Geben, um irgendwann als Profi gegen den Ball zu tretten (ja man!)
Du solltest bald verstehen, von nichts, kommt nichts
Also Schatzi, ab ins Training

Hap Palmer,"I can put my clothes on by myself;
I don't need help from anyone.
I go through my drawer,
And choose what I adore,

Then proudly check the mirror when I'm done.
So what if both my socks are not the same;
I like getting dressed when I can choose.
If one sock is white and red,
And one is blue instead,

My feet will still stay warm inside my shoes.
And when I wear orange pants with my green cap,
You may think they clash with my pink shirt.
But I might have a style,
That helps the world to smile,

And surely you'll agree that cannot hurt.
Oh, I can put my clothes on by myself!
I don't need help from mom or dad.
It takes more time I know,
Right now I'm kind of slow,

But taking time is really not so bad.

It won't be long 'til I can do it too.
'Tho I'm just learnin' how,

I have no problem now,
My velcro shoes will do just fine, thank you!
So what if I wear winter clothes in spring;
I'll just throw some off if I get hot.

Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar,
Just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing:

Now the nation rise as one
To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent

What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?
Boom boom

If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Go west young man you said, I was on my way

The pages turned, I stayed put

Happyland,"Another dumb radio song
Let's turn it up and all sing along.
You can't be sure but you've heard it before
So soft and light just six major chords.

Guaranteed to make a visible difference.
Fortified with purifying tones.
Adding volume while retaining highlights.
It works like a dream.

It's softly contemporary,
Glides on so it's light and creamy,
Skins smooth without feeling greasy,
Your hairs looking soft and dreamy.

I love a dumb radio song,
Firms up the thighs while you hum along.
Kind to sensitive skin
They'll never know that you're wearing it.

Guaranteed to keep the moisture surging.
Fortified with rabbit fetal gel.
Stay fast color for the binge and purging.
It's just like a dream.

It's softly contemporary,
Glides on so it's light and airy,
Skins smooth without feeling greasy,
Your hairs looking soft and dreamy.

You've got wings for every party,
Shaped to fit your natural form.
Now comes with an applicator.

It's hip and it's now and funky.
It's pop but a little punky.

And swim around with my family.

Back to the form I once was.

I want to go back to the sea
And swim around with my family.

It's a brand new day

Cold inside with I open the door (Minneapolis)
So I'm gonna shut it tight
So I don't feel it no more (New Orleans)
And when it tries to creep in the cracks in my window (Louisville)
I close my eyes and sing to myself no no no

Gotta lose that edge and stop actin' tough (Midwest)
The only thing that'll save you now is love sweet love

People come together and get along
Cause the bottom line is we all need motivation (Steel Town)
There's a feeling inside when I sing this song (St. Cloud)
Their tempers hatin' all of my frustrations

We're wide smilin' keep it strong
And soon your old ghosts will all be gone
Take the time to listen to your heart beat on
And we'll be gettin' lifted 'til the sun goes down

I already sold your ring on Ebay
And I'm leaving you on Valentine's Day
Because you triffled way to long
And I wasted my breath on to many songs, about you

There's a feelin' I get, when I look to the wet spots on your bedspread
Because the olny time you get excited is when I'm crawling up our body
Now tell me what happened at that party
When I found you chillin' with now clothes
And your legs wrapped around another bro
I can't take it no more

I went to my ride
So nobody would see the tears I cried
I must have died

A thousand times that night

I'm tossin' and turnin'
Because you're flossin' and burnin'
The night away
And I can't take it another day

There's a feelin' I get, when I look to the wet spot on your bedspread
Because the only time you get excited is when I'm crawling up our body
Now tell me what happened at that party
When I found you chillin' with now clothes
And your legs wrapped around another bro

The ocean breeze will serve us right

Get out your creepy thing 'cause Halloween is sneaking up our way
Oh it's spooky
Ooh I can see your breath, you're bound to get your death without no sleep

Slid between my sheets, 
Gonna split my head.

The beast the dwells within, 
The bittersweet nightmares 
I fixed to grind you in.

It kept me out of bed, 
The thrill that you give's 
Gonna kill me dead, 

Hey little girl, 
No reason to shout. 
You made up your own dreams 
Now you can get yourself around. 

Cut me up, break me off baby, 
Don't let go ‘til I can't breathe. 
I may run but I still want it 
Follow me into my dream. 

Cut me up, break me off baby, 
Don't let go ‘til I can't breathe.

Cut me up, cut it through me (ow, ow, oww!) 
Cut me up, cut it through me (ow, ow, oww!) 
Cut me up, cut it through me (ow, ow, oww!)

Your pins hit my skin until it bled. 

The fuck will lift 
When our bodies feel the sweat, 
That ain't no feel when your panties getting wet,

The thrill that you give's gonna kill me dead.

Now I'm coming back to settle up and take your heart

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

That ain't the half, breath so sweet
Full figured calves and her sexy feet
From toe to head, from the darkest meat
to the bones that's red, and I repeat

To my chicks and my niggaz, in the street
And that's where we stay so we can compete
From the tips of her nails, to the depths of her

Not a Gangsta Bitch, cause she don't have a Glock
Not that nothing's wrong with that
but the Ghetto Diamonds I fuck with they don't carry gats
They leave the bustin to me
She might drive the getaway car if I so choose G
But we ain't with that, the shit is detrimental
I'd rather have a honey with a slammin ass mental
So peep the drama, come here little mama
with your Bulls hat tipped and your pants saggin Palmer

Hard Knocks,"You claim you're still bitter
but I got the raw end of the deal

[ VERSE 1: Hardhead ]
I heard the expression 'a dog is a man's best friend'
But I grew up thinkin it was a woman
But I had to learn the hard way
Never thought I'd see the day I'd be sleepin on the subway
But that's the path she chose
The next day I arose still kickin the same clothes
I had to make a decision
Even though I lost her my friends still gave me recognition
Bein recognized by the guys
Wasn't a surprise, you see, cause they're my homies
And with them I get nuff respect (nuff respect)
When I was down they were there
When I didn't have, they were more than happy to share
Inside I feel the pains trapped
I don't feel she dissed me but I feel I got a bum rap
The guys knew what I was thinkin of
The only thing to cure an old love was a new love

A ghetto love

[ VERSE 2: Hardhead ]
It's 3 o'clock, I'm hungry and I'm cold
I want to call her but she's even changed area codes

To hell with it, I go to my man's crib
Oh, his name is Bezo
The type of power only friendship could bestow
I ring his bell and he's alarmed
And I'm greeted in with open arms
The next day, a different routine
I'm caught drinkin on a public scene
I'm callin my homies to come get me
Cause I know down they never let me
Free as a bird, once again I'm chillin
My homies ain't rich, but to me they're top-billin
Over, over again they've proven
Not even a jail cell can separate a real friend
It seems that our love as a crew gets better and better
We stick as a posse like a stamp to a letter
What's theirs is mines, what's mines is theirs
Cause in this ghetto love game we play fair
I'm unspoiled by success
Even though God's blessed they're still not impressed
The way they once treated me they still treat me
It's nothin different now cause I'm makin a little money
Like when we hang, rumbles still continue
Puttin heads out is still on our menu
We'll go to war in a heartbeat
And I never went to war and they ran out and left me
We're all about one for all and all for one
And if it's more than one you better have more than one gun
The only sleep that outlasts love is death
And we'll hang until one of us takes the last breath
How close can a clan of man be?
That one partner's pain is his posse's mysery?
We say they come a dime a dozen
But I've been turned on by my own so-called cousins
Is the blood we shed really thicker than water?
If it is, then maybe you oughta

Witness
A ghetto love

I'ma always have my homies
They gon' see me in the cold, or hunger
or just out there driftin, whatever
All my homies around the way in the South Bronx
Jason, Shawn, my man Jim-Jim, the whole posse
Those who I miss, you know who you are
[Name], Bezo, Lucky
The official crew, y'all know
The same crew that always goes through
the rain and the shine

You got us in a fight
You owed some money
To a monkey who had seen you right

You sold your furniture
So you could pay him off
They cut the power
Can't afford it you slept on the floor

You can't hold down a job
So then you had to rob
First from your mom and then your friends and then the local shop
But as a criminal

You're just no good at all
You got your collar felt
So dumb, you thought about skipping bail
Now you're in jail

You loved to watch the sky
And you get beat and injured
End up throwing up all night

You could not take no more
So when they closed the door
Tied up your sheets - strang yourself up
And then you were no more, no more

Every day I,I,I see your face
As I walk on by past that awful place
23 hours in a cell
Each and every day just locked up living hell, living hell, living hell

In shop and office, we sing our song we all sing

With that in mind, what's there to lose?

But we will not be denied
Coming out of the shadows
We rock the satellites

Suburban nights, they get so hot
People get angry, we sing our song we all sing
A global terror they say, we are at war
But I ain't got time for that 'cause
These bills keep dropping through my door
Hear them all singing

We're the ones you've forgotten
Out of mind, out of sight
Coming out of the shadows

We're only saying what we're seeing with our own eyes
This one way system it ain't, it ain't paradise
Not everybody wants to race, wants to fight

The only thing I need right now, the warmth of a gun
Only wanted to peace me and my mom
I guess he did not mean to hurt no one

When you treat me like you do
And you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?

I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard your words
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?

Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They will turn away no more

And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes
I'd be a heavenly person today

And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?

Now I stand here waiting

I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me, how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

And I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me, how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?",Blue Monday [Hardfloor Remix]
