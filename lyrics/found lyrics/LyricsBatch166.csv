Helene Fischer,"Märchen schreibt die Zeit
Immer wieder wahr
Eben kaum gekannt
Dann doch zugewandt
Unerwartet klar

Wandel nur zu zweit
Eh es sich erschließt
Beiden war so Bang
Beide ohne Zwang
Die Schöne und das Biest

Ewig wie die Zeit
Ewig und beredt
Ewig altbekannt
Ewig imposant
Wie die Sonn' aufgeht
Märchen schreibt die Zeit
Es ist ein altes Lied
Bittersüß verwirrt
Einseh´n, daß man irrt
Und auch mal vergibt

Wie das Licht der Sonn'
Strahlend sich ergießt
Märchen schreibt die Zeit
In des Dichters Kleid
Die Schöne und das Biest
Märchen schreibt die Zeit
In des Dichters Kleid
Die Schöne und das Biest",Die Schöne und das Biest
Helene Fischer,"Wie ein Komet der verglüht und fällt
So fühlt sie sich auf dieser Welt
Er war ihr Mann, ihr Freund, die große Liebe
Sag, wer schreibt das Buch, dass sich Leben nennt
Erst heißgeliebt und dann herzgetrennt
Doch Tränen machen stark für neue Ziele
Sie hatte Angst allein zu sein
Und dass ihr Herz daran zerbricht
In Wahrheit sah sie endlich wieder Sonnenlicht, oh uh oh

Alice im Wunderland
Die ihre Hoffnung wieder fand
Ganz neue Wege, ihre Seele
Tanzt sich frei, frei, frei
Sie ist wie Alice im Wunderland
Sie hält den Spiegel in der Hand
Das ist ihr Leben, ihre Sehnsucht, ihr Gefühl
Es zählt nur was sie will

Sie steht wieder auf, zieht was Neues an
Sie sagt „ich will alles“ denn ich bin dran
Will raus aus meiner Haut
Ich will nur leben
Denn meine Chance, die ist jetzt und hier
Hab‘ Glück verdient und ich kämpf‘ dafür
Ich liebe mich und kann mir viel vergeben
Der Stachel tief im Herz ist fort
Sie wirft die Zweifel über Bord
Sie ist so stark und nimmt ihr Leben in die Hand, oh uh oh

Alice im Wunderland
Die ihre Hoffnung wieder fand
Ganz neue Wege, ihre Seele
Tanzt sich frei, frei, frei
Sie ist wie Alice im Wunderland
Sie hält den Spiegel in der Hand
Das ist ihr Leben, ihre Sehnsucht, ihr Gefühl
Es zählt nur was sie will

Helene Fischer,"Lass uns zusammen ein Stück gehen
Schenk‘ mir ein bisschen Zeit
Erzähl‘ mir Deine Geschichte
Die das Leben für Dich schrieb
Erzähl‘ mir alles, wenn Du mit mir zurück siehst

Hast Du das Glück für Dich gefunden?
Was war Dein schönster Augenblick?
Bei dem Dein Herz sich voller Zauber noch heute überschlägt
Und Du lächelst, wenn Du mir davon erzählst

Ich find‘ es schön
Ein kleines Stück mit Dir zu gehen

Ich würd‘ so gerne die Welt durch Deine Augen sehen
Deine Träume und Gedanken will ich leben und verstehen
Ich würd‘ so gern die Welt mit Deinen Augen sehen
Aus Deinem Leben will ich lernen
Um meinen Weg zu gehen

Ich leg‘ den Blick auf Deine Worte
Und find‘ es schön Dir zuzuhören

Die Gezeiten übersteht
Und der Moment für immer unsterblich ist

Helene Fischer,"Ich spür das Meer
Ich spür das Salz auf meiner Haut, und du
bist aus den Wellen aufgetaucht
Wie am leeren Strand, liegen wir im Sand
Wir sind uns fremd und irgendwie doch so vertraut, wie ein Traum
der wirklich wurde unverhofft, bist du
du gehst mir nicht mehr aus dem Kopf,
Wie mein Lieblingslied, wie ein Salsabeat
Wir sprechen andere Sprachen und verstehen uns doch

Wenn die Sonne versinkt
Und dann an der Strandbar die Party beginnt
Braucht man Worte doch nicht
Denn ich weiß du siehst denn selben
Himmel wie ich

Sterne in der Sommernacht
Leuchten auf dem Meer
Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero, oh oh
Ein Kuss ist in allen Sprachen gleich,
Auf diese Art sag ich dir
Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero, oh oh

Wie der Mond
der über unsern Köpfen thront, dort oben
so hoch bin ich noch nie geflogen,
Sind wir uns auch fremd, wir versteh'n uns blind
Weil wir beide Teil vom gleichen Himmel sind

Wenn die Sonne versinkt
Und dann an der Strandbar die Party beginnt
Braucht man Worte doch nicht
Denn ich weiß genau, was du sagen willst wenn du mich küsst

Sterne in der Sommernacht
Leuchten auf dem Meer
Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero, oh oh
Ein Kuss ist in allen Sprachen gleich
Auf diese Art sag ich dir
Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero, oh oh

Es gibt es keine Worte für

Helene Fischer,"Ich dachte jeden Tag daran
Irgendwo und irgendwann
Werd' ich wieder Leben spüren
Und noch einmal mein Herz riskieren
Was bisher nicht möglich war
Erleb' ich jetzt, denn du bist da
Das Leben schien so weit entfernt
Mit dir hab' ich es neu gelernt

Wir zwei können schweben
Und unsre Träume leben
Wir zwei können glauben
Weil wir uns Hoffnung geben
Die Welt neu erfinden
Und aus den Angeln heben
Immer und immer und immer und immer wieder
Wir zwei können lachen
Weil wir der Grund dafür sind
Wir zwei können lieben
Segeln im selben Südwind
Egal, wo es hingeht
Alle Wege führen zu uns
Immer und immer und immer und immer wieder

Wenn ich mal die Spur verlier'
Find' ich doch den Weg zu dir
Frag' mich manchmal,kann das sein?’
Durch dich bin ich nie ganz allein

Denn du bist die Antwort
Auf all die vielen Fragen
Wenn das hier kein Traum ist
Dann kann ich wirklich sagen

Hélène Ségara,"Vivo per lei da quando sai
la prima volta l'ho incontrata
non mi ricordo come ma
mi è entrata dentro e c'è restata
Vivo per lei perché mi fa
vibrare forte l'anima
vivo per lei e non è un peso

Je vis pour elle depuis toujours
Qu'elle me déchire ou qu'elle soit tendre
Elle nous dessine après l'amour
Un arc-en-ciel dans notre chambre
Elle est musique et, certains jours,
Quand notre cœur se fait trop lourd,
Elle est la seule à pouvoir nous porter secours

E una musa che ci invita

Elle vivra toujours en moi

atraverso un pianoforte
la morte è lontana
io vivo per lei

Je vis pour elle jour après jour
Quand ses accords en moi se fondent
C'est ma plus belle histoire d'amour

è un pugno che non fa mai male

Vivo per lei lo so mi fa
girare di città in città
soffrire un po' ma almeno io vivo

Je serais perdu sans elle

Vivo per lei dentro gli hotels

Je suis triste et je l'appelle

Vivo per lei nel vortice

Attraverso la mia voce
si espande e amore produce

Vivo per lei nient'altro ho
e quanti altri incontrero
che come me hanno scritto in viso
io vivo per lei

Io vivo per lei

sopra un palco o contro ad un muro

Elle me ressemble comme tu vois

anche in un domani duro

J'existe enfin, je sais pourquoi

Ogni giorno una conquista
la protagonista sarà sempre lei

Vivo per lei perché oramai
io non ho altra via d'uscita
perché la musica lo sai
da vero non l'ho mai tradita

Elle est musique, elle a des ailes
Elle m'a donné la clé du ciel
Qui m'ouvre enfin les portes du soleil
J'existe par elle

Vivo per lei la musica

J'existe pour elle

Vivo per lei è unica

Elle est toi et moi

Io vivo per lei

Io vivo

Hélène Ségara,"Avant la fin,
Je suis venue te dire
Qu’entre nous deux
Rien n’est fini
Avant la fin
Même si tu veux tout détruire
J’irai au bout de tes nuits

Je te regarde passer
Sans jamais ne rien dire
Je regarde venir

Je suis à cote mais tu ne me vois pas
Où est passé le temps de nos premiers émois
Sous des soleils crevés à chacun de tes pas 
Je te suivrai de près à en perdre ma voix

Souvent me reviens l’âme que tu étais autrefois
Bien avant que le désert ne gagne la cours
Et que le ciel ne sombre
Au fond de toi

Helheim,"I am the god of slander
The one that leads you astray
I am born among the highest gods
But I never foresee myself
By their side
I take the forms of many
A beast my words for the hypocrisy

I am the reason of betrayal
I allure the purest to fall
These are not deeds of evil
But ways to own amusement

I am the god of slander
Mockery is my state of being
I give birth to the beasts
Who dwell in their chains

God of slander
I choose myself above all
Even though pain is my fortune

Everlasting malice
Taste our supremacy
Feel the final front

Brand this mark
Remember its power
Once seduced there's no escape
The olden Law has taken new forms

It's the icon of everything
The symbol of pagan unity
None can change our view
Withdrawn from the common ways

The beast of a new age
Crushing everything in their way
Branded by the icon
The nine stages that makes us whole

Spew out your hate

On this poisoned earthly ground

Sinners wake
Save the sorry and fool yourself
That is the of the blind
Infinite dreams of an infinite realm
Where no heathen tread

The cross points black
The words are silent

Am I really the reason

Increase the speed

Painfully aware of the lot
The sinister slumber in me
I unveil the darkest of all
Into the abyss you fall

Pitch the faith 
To dead silence

These years of deep pain

Faces pale as the moon

Stalking the landscape in the shape of an oak
Misery loves company

One could hear the violin play
A single dead tune
Marking the age of the dead

One nation lost in the claws of an oak
So foul that her gaze alone would make one freeze in torment

They will murder each king and each trell
Where they drown in the sea

Hell Is for Heroes,"We've been abducted
My head corrupted
Sharp shock commotion
Stirs up confusion
We failed to notice
Blinded by daylight
This grand delusion
We lost the track

I stand corrected

These bones upon me
Plastered and fractured
Make your selection
Through gaps in memory
They tell their own tale
Playing for time..

We'll never close the open space

Return us to the fear we know

Hell Is for Heroes,"I pull back the blinds, taste the air,
Time to return to the warmth they gave you,
All looks the same, feel so strange, time passes by
In a silent vacuum

I push back the night, step out into the echo,
You've been standing in the corner,
Always listening to the same words,
Night goes, composing in echo's,
Between all the other insects,
Looks like a world lost now...

Tear out the blinds, nothings changed,
Can't place the names, but they sound familiar,
I've died inside, seven days, time passes by,
And died a fraction...

Here comes the time, the sins of diseration,
Feels like maybe you belong here,
Gather sentences from nowhere,
Creatures crawling out the wood work,
Stand straight, face to face with your fears,
Looks like a world lost now!

Who protects you from, your protectors gone,
He waves a stick. Keeps you sick
Push back the night.
Push back the night.
Push back the night.

Here comes the time, the sins of diseration,
Feels like maybe you belong here,
Gather sentences from nowhere,

I want to see why'all niggaz get live in the party tonight
All my niggaz on the left hand side, I know your high or
I know you came to the club, to not die
All my niggaz in the center, I came to enter
In the, middle of your brain cell, it's me, Hell Razah
Article one, hit the streets nigga
4th Disciple, and we got the rifle

I pull in wolves like Adolf Hitler, for my two brothers
And two sisters, I tattoo scriptures
Love my seed, like I love the Lord
I was thirteen, when I first record, now I'm back with a heavier sword
It's either rap, crack, or basketball
Young kings want to gun sling, and snatch earrings
Eighty seven, it was microphone fiend, and crack king
We used to battle on the lunch room table, before labels
Now they pay us, so the radio play you
You'se a lame nigga, and you know, we know the truth
And we back, and we back in the booth, first recoup
Then recruit, now salute, we on the loose, ain't ready to shoot
Blueberry in our Timberland boot, I'm livin' proof
Tell your A&R we burnin' his coupes
My lifestyle is danger, Hell Razah, let the name linger
Touch my throat, and I cut off ten fingers
The street's I'm from, son, everybody's steamers
Smokers and heavy drinkers, slingers and chain swingers
I'm one of those, Red Hook cats, set up a track
Bring your soul to another world, you'll never come back
It be that government that made us like that, gave me a gat
I be excuses every ghetto inside, is fallen at
Got the chick high off of contact, keep the windows up
Whoever rollin' with me in here, throw your singles up
It's loyalty over money, bitches, and keys
Backstab me, snatch his arms out the both of his sleeves
Chain and command, explained from a brain of a man
We go to war, like the Arabs'll do, from Pakistan
Matter fact, like the Sun of Man would, from Bethlehem
Drop a jewel that the children out in school, can understand

All my brothers on the right hand side
I want to make sure why'all leave out this party alive
And all my ladies on the left hand side, that got a drop and
Hold it down, cause we don't got nine lives
All my people in the center, I came to enter

[Chorus]
It's Rebel Music, put your mind into it
Right hand in the air, before you solemly sware it's

The next rap level to music, step your paint game up
And if not, then keep moving
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 

Rebel Music free the pain inside, until this day in my ghetto
I hear echoes, where anger cry, feel me?
I bring tears to the angel eye, and paint pictures
With a pen, for the saints that die
Why you happy go lucky, off of record label lies
I make, rebel music, verse the devil's illusion
This time, they can't pacify the revolution
Even if they plan to pay us back, retrobution
I revoke to be part of their couch, 'cause we don't own
Enough boats, to be shipping in no bundles of coke
I can't advertise, on killin' my folks, who dead broke
While I'm thinkin' of my ancestors, hung on ropes
Black queens havin' seeds while she's strung on dope
I resurrected Nat Turner with this song that I wrote wrote

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, this be the theme for the UBP's
O.G.'s, and they young seeds
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, I rebel against the true system
A young man givin' old wisdom, over soul witness

I try to stay out of drama, give my life to the heavenly father
'92 had a fetish for them heavy revolvers
We die as martyrs, underground, call me Osama
Plant seeds like a farmer, off of positive karma
Spiritual armor, bring me more medals of honor
I'm not your average M.C., son, my level is sharper
The ghetto is smarter, children of them biblical authors
Abraham, lost sheep, must continue the saga
Revelations, 2 and 9 prove that Christ was darker
Than the paintings on your walls, and your living room halls
Tatooed on your arms, and you chains and charms
Tell moms that I love her, God, for singing me songs

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music, Rebel Music's on my side always (it's what I keep by my side)
Live in the ghetto, and I die in the ghetto, ghetto
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
My mind be crumb, the revolutionary seven needs
They raised up in the eighties, with these crack babies

Rest in peace on my project walls, a young drug lord
It's either rap now, or basketball
Everybody gotta jersey on, thinkin' they be murdering songs
Same hoes that put burberry on
You only learn when your hustle is wrong, you stepped your game
Shooters miss, when they aim up, Bush applied and they blamed us
Do a coke bust, hit the crib, say Bin Laden blew it up
Locked up, half of my raise, until we wise up
Rise up, and master our faith, word up, son
I'm a true black brother, ask Angie Stone
Papa was a rolling stone, Razah be the heir to the throne
Now I got check writers, ears to the phone
Meetings with big businessmen in other timezones
Chrome registered guns, two educated sons
Goons ready to ill when the revolution comes

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always
You'll be back like young black geronimo jacks
With a calico, trenchcoats and godfather hats
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride""
Afro picks, black leather gloves and Cadillac's
Marvin Gaye tracks, straps like Ron O'Neal

Rest in peace, Bobby Seals, Bobby Seals
Lived to die, for revolutionary music, rest in peace
Tupac Ashata Shakur, get up, stand up
Lived to die, for revolution music
Rest in peace to all the brothers in the ghetto
Didn't make it, get up stand up, don't give up the fight
Lived to die, for revolution music
Said get up, stand up, revolution to the only black
Sun of Man, the son of god
Get up, stand up, rest in peace, to all my brothers Tard and Clint

Whisper sweet words in my ear.
Can we go out together?
Can we make out and pretend it's all there?

Something that hasn't come through
But it might come along soon
And until that, you will do
I can't believe it's not love!

I'll take you to the movies
Yell at you when you're late

And when we get drunk, we can get it together

Hello Saferide,"And suddenly, I don't feel fat anymore
I don't count my blackheads as a hobby
I don't count the marks on the wall
And I don't sleep well at all

There is someone else right beside me
He kept every secret I told
He giggled his way straight through fall
And I don't sleep well at all

He knows when I'm happy and nods when I'm sad
And he puts out when I come home drunk
And suddenly I stand real tall
But I don't sleep well at all

I have seen too many movies
I have read too many books
I'm the kind that sees sun and brings an umbrella
I have been to fortune tellers

Or throw out the key and change the lock
But I don't sleep well at all",I Don't Sleep Well
Hello Saferide,"Finally, the sky is blue
Last night, my friends dragged me to some lake
We drove there real late, we went too fast
Sipping cheap sangria in the backseat
Everybody are laughing and we are listening to our favorite songs
But I thought you said summer is going to take the pain away

January brought a headache
In February, it got even worse
And when you thought it couldn't get more awful
Say hello to March
April brought me to a funeral
Gained another ten pounds in May
But I thought you said summer is going to take the pain away

Have you ever had the feeling no one really knows what you're all about
And when you try to show them
They all have things to do tonight
Tonight

Up on a roof, looking over the city
All by myself thinking:
There is nowhere I would rather be than here, so why am I not
Like the others, and why are you not here with me doing crossword puzzles

Summer's going to take the pain away
When I'm gone, I promise

Hello Saferide,"I check my bed for bugs and spiders
(though I don't really believe they're there)
I check my head, it's getting tighter
I want to stop, but I don't dare
I will not sleep until I've counted to 200 three times
I will not sleep until my pencils lie in a straight line

Goodnight, goodbye
It's late, and I'm too tired to cry
Goodnight, goodbye
Just let me close my weary eyes

I pray to God twice in the evenings
And check the stove four times each day
I spin around the door to make sure that it's locked
And wear these lucky socks until they fade away
The house might burn down
And it's all my fault if that puddle doesn't get me wet
If I get home before the rain, you're mine
But I won't bet

One day, I'll be stepping
On cracks and close my eyes
But I'm too tired to argue with myself
I'll just do this one more time","If I Don't Write This Song, Someone I Love Will Die"

What would you say if I asked of you
- out of loneliness, out of loneliness
Could I be with you
Can I be with you

It's warm inside the night club
Your face is lit up by a disco light
I don't want to go home alone, not tonight
I have a picture of a man who used to sit in that chair
I will go anywhere
Just as long as I'm with someone
You will do, just take me home for tea

If I told you my stories and sang you my songs
Would you laugh at me
Would you pity me
What would you say if I asked of you
Not out of accident, out of loneliness
Would you shelter me
Will you shelter me

I will be gone when you wake up
No awkward breakfasts, I swear
And don't you look for me, because I could be anywhere
In someone else's house
In someone else's arms
With someone else to warm the pain away

What would you want from me
What would you say if I just fell asleep",Loneliness Is Better When You're Not Alone
Hello Saferide,"Hello
Do you remember me
I am your long lost pen pal
It must have been ten years ago we last wrote
I don't really know what happened
I guess life came in the way
Let me know if you're still alive
Let me know if you ever used that knife or not

Hello
Yes I remember you
I've got a husband and two children now
I work as an accountant and make fairly good money
I still have your letters, you used a pink pen to write them
And you would comfort me
When my tears would stain the ink
And I would send you mix tapes with Kate Bush on

I have to admit I sometimes lied in those letters
Tried to make life better than it was
I still wasn't kissed at sixteen
And I still need a friend

There was this letter
I never told you this back then
But it would be fair to say it saved my life
I sat in the window
The only one left out from a party again
Pretty sure I didn't have a single friend
Then I checked the mailbox

Dear long lost penpal
I was lying the whole time
I'm really a 46 years old man named Luke
I have three children
And a wife, she doesn't care
And I hope you don't resent me
And I hope you do not hate me
For trying to find my way back to what it's like to be young

I have to admit I sometimes lied in those letters
Tried to make life better than it was
I still wasn't kissed at sixteen
And I still need a friend",Long Lost Pen Pal
Hello Saferide,"You call me up in the mornings
We'll stay on the phone until dawning
You tell me secrets I actually keep
You call me up around noon and
Bring me all the good gossip
You hold my head when I throw up
I hold your hand when you weep

And we talk about friends
Ad we talk about records, talk about life
And we'll talk about death, and we dance in the living room
Dance on the sidewalks, dance in the movies
Dance at the festivals, dance, dance
No men ever really dance like this

Damn! I wish I was a lesbian
Damn! I wish I was a lesbian
Damn! I wish I was, and that you were, too
So I could fall in love with you

You call me up in the evenings
And tell me what they did this time
No matter what, I'm by your side
When it's raining, we'll go to the video store
We even like the same movies
No damn jedis or hobbits, this time

And you laugh at my jokes and I laugh at your jokes
And I even like the birthday presents you get me

The tingling of the first night again
Us moving slowly, Merle Haggard, the fading sun
Well, there's nothing like you when you're gone

I wear your sweatshirt again
The one with the cast of Falcon Crest on
The one I forbade you to use time and again
Well it's sad, I keep putting it on

“I can't believe that we're here again
Have you forgotten the women, the drinking, the Blues of the Eighties collection
Oh my God, you're wearing your Lorenzo Lamas again”

Yes, I am crying again!

I know, cause I've been there
Summer never seemed to come along
And when it did, it felt all wrong
You've been sitting on the sidewalks wondering what went wrong with your life
You've been walking to your bedside table and in the top drawer was a knife

Time to take your sweetheart by the hand and lead him to the Promised Land
The only place in North America not destroyed by the government
San Francisco! You're going
San Francisco! We're going
Don't you know you'll never ever want to turn back

I have news for you my friend:
I'm sticking by you until the end
Doctor's ordering you the same prescription, see, that worked wonders for me
I sat by myself in bars, I was driven home in state-owned cars
I was filled with so much hate until I saw the Golden Gate
Until my sweetheart took me by the hand and led me to the Promised Land
The only place in North America not yet destroyed by the government

San Francisco! You're going
San Francisco! We're going
Don't you know you'll never ever want to turn back

And it's time to pack your bags and call in sick and bring the toothbrush
Withdraw from that savings account what's savings for, time doesn't wait and
Hold the door, I'm coming, all that jazz
Like an escape from Alcatraz",San Francisco
Hello Saferide,"Somebody ordered too many drinks last night
Somebody reckoned dancing on the bar's all right
Somebody woke up next to someone else, thinking
Some people thought about killing off themselves

Oh, Lord! Forgive me them Saturday nights
They'll make you do things you'll regret for the rest of your life
And Lord! Forbid them glimmering Saturday lights
And tell me I am not me on Saturday nights

Who was that girl who shouted “This one's on me!”
Who was that girl who dropped her drink on a celebrity
Who was that girl who fell asleep under a tree, singing
Who was that girl, I know for sure it wasn't me

Somebody reckoned well just one drink that'll do

Reminds you of times when you were someone else
Then 'God only knows' and you pared up as two
As the turn of the seasons you come and go
I can never claim control of either of you
You're too sweet to be just mine alone
And I try to stay humble over the fact that
Sometime when the time is right you will pass my door
The crescendo comes and'
 And 'God only knows' and you have the same sad similarity

Mark the places in my book
With photographs we never took

I swear that I'm not kidding

With all the stars above your eyes
In sneaking out and making ties

Track the beating with a chart
Mark the rythyms that I shook
Every time I caught you look

Hear the forecast ain't as bad as it seems

Hellogoodbye,"I built this house
With my own hands
And she just came
And burnt the plans
She found the safe
And cracked the code
She grabbed the goods
And hit the road

And I'm
Feeling dumb
Oh, oh, girl
You're the one

Who shut off my electricity
Explained we just lack chemistry
And on the walls and on the shelves
She hung up pictures of herself

And I'm keeping one
Oh, oh, girl
You're the one

Who makes it hard to
Lock my doors at night
Even my fire alarms won't work right
And as I try to sleep I
Glance next doors
And all I see is his lips touching yours
Oh girl

I will dig a hole and label it love
And trick her to fall in from above
Strategically placed at the front door
I'll coax her to come back to get more

Oh, girl
You're the one
Oh, girl

Who makes it hard to
Lock my doors at night
Even my fire alarms won't work right
And as I try to sleep I
Glance next doors
And all I see is his lips touchings yours
Oh, girl",Homewrecker [*][Demo Version]
Hellogoodbye,"There exists a melody 
That just might change your mind 
If only i knew the key 
To sing to make you mine 

Then I saw it on your keyboard 
And you saw it on my sleeve 
I never knew a heart existed 
Outside of make believe 
Till I saw it on your keyboard 
I knew at least I might just have a chance 
To catch a shooting star 

There exists a star above 
That always steals my stare 
And there exists a star on stage 
That never seems to care 

I saw it on your keyboard 
And you saw it in my eyes 
I didn't mean to scare you 
You just seem really nice 
And when I read it on your keyboard 
I knew at least I might just have a chance

Hellogoodbye,"You've got your airplane, I've got the plain air out of here
You're gone, I've gone insane, oh, when will you reappear?
I'm just some new kid who can't get his mind off of you
And I know that it's stupid

'Cause you've gone to Hawaii and I've gotten no letters from you
I should stop whining 'cause it's only been a day or two
I don't know what you did but you got me to fall for you
And I know that it's stupid

Your family's far and I wish that they were here today
But they're thousands and thousands of miles away

I felt so bad when your mom
Caught us eating ice cream in your room at three in the morning
'Cause I'd hate for her to not want me around her daughter
'Cause my heart stops every time

You've got Polaroid and you even know how to rhyme
I'd be overjoyed if we could just hang out sometime
I don't know what you did but you got me to fall for you
And I know that it's stupid

Your drawing's fried and I hung it in on my wall
And I made sure it wouldn't fall 'cause if it did

My straw wrapper might tear
There would be no knot and I would feel
Like I'd been shot right through the heart
And I'd fall apart but I'd remember how, my heart stops every time

You are so special, I just hope that we can be friends
I'll wait forever but I guess that it all depends
On you and yours, so come on and dance with me
You are so special

I hope this makes you smile
And you might stay that way for a while
'Cause you deserve every grin that you get
And you'll get 'em a lot from me

You are so special, I just hope that we can be friends
I'll wait forever but I guess that it all depends

I should say that I'm sorry on their behalf
I should say something funny

I didn't see the steps I took
Had taken you from me

What could I say so carefully?

Carefully

I was gettin' tired of lettin' all my hours pass
Hopin' someday soon or somewhere everything would last

Your hair was long and brown
You hadn't yet cut it all off

As I kept track of every haircut that we ever had
I could, I could see how long it had been, oh
Oh, how long it had been

And this thought, made it clearer
I ought to be near her

All I see is where our days repeat
And our love goes on
As our hair grows long

Oh, Chelsea Lynn
I watched your hair grow from the root to tip
I know, I know I have always known
And I always will know
Oh, oh
That I could have a single direction until I am dead
I'll go, I'll go as I always have gone, and
And I always will go

Paralyzed and floating in the air
Or I thought
'Cause no one really knows
I couldn't stop

So I wanted her
To feel the breeze
Just blowing through the trees
A ghost
Of something in our love we don't yet know

It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable
Everything is debatable

So I waited there
Burdened by some things I shouldn't care about
I brushed them off
And dug my heart back out

It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable
Everything is debatable

I seem kinda strange
I saw the other side
Floating around in the room
I realized
You thought I'd look the same
Despite some flashing lights
Floating around over you

It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance

And the tyrants will feel the steel of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth
Forever to be free from their load

Time has run our for all you tyrants on earth
Your slaves are heedin' the call
Makin' an end to all this terror and pain
An end to your lies and your law

Takin' away all your gold and your money
Cause dead men won't need it anymore
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips
So now you will feel our swords

Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky
The day will come when all power has been broken

Satan will wait for your souls
Pray to your god he won't help you he's dead
He won't fool our minds and our souls...anymore!

Magic in the air on Halloween
Black is the night full of fright
You'll be missing the day
Watch will be here very soon changing your way
A knock at your door
Is it real or is it a dream
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream on Halloween
On Halloween

Darkness
Where am I now
Is there anybody out there
What has happened
Am I in heaven
Or is it hell

I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining
It's shining so bright
It's shining on me, yeah

I am the one, doom 's in my hands
Now make your choice,
Redeemed or enslaved

I'll show you passion and glory?
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man

Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind's
Deliverance and peace of mind

But watch out, beware 
Listen, take care

In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise
Ah it's Halloween
Ah it's Halloween 
Ah it's Halloween 
Ah it's Halloween
Oh yeah, it's Halloween 
Yeah it's Halloween 
Yeah it's Halloween 
Yeah it's Halloween tonight",Halloween [Video Edit] [*]

Sometimes when he's feeling bored, he's calling it a day

Helloween,"From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see

So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

(I want out) to live my life alone
(I want out)
Leave me be (I want out)
To do things on my own (I want out)
To live my life and to be free

People tell me a and b
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'Cause I decide the way things gonna be

(I want out) 
To live my life alone (I want out)
Leave me be (I want out)
To do things on my own (I want out)
To live my life and to be free

There's a million ways to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool
In the end of it, none of us is right
Sometimes we need to be alone

No no no, leave me alone

Helloween,"Make the people
Hold each other's hands
And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind
So do as divined

Put on your armour
Ragged after fights
Hold up your sword
You're leaving the light

Make yourself ready
For the lords of the dark
They'll watch your way
So be cautious, quiet and hark

You hear them whispering
In the crowns of the trees
You're whirling 'round
But your eyes don't agree

Will'o'the wisps
Misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse
Without takin' their wrath

Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us be--kill!

[Chorus]
You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the Seer of Visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

You can feel cold sweat
Running down your neck
And the dwarfs of falseness
Throw mud at your back

Guided by spells
Of the old Seer's hand
You're suffering pain
Only steel can stand

Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfull your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway

[Chorus]

Throw the first key into the sea of hate

Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belongs into the sea of greed

And the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease my friend
For this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease my friend
Throw the key or you may die

On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He is sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He is playing you out with delight

""Man who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven stars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be""

Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key...!

An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!

Are the expression of infinitive intelligence
We express our belief that all forms of life
Are manifestations of spirit
And thus, all men are children of God

Waiting for his future and the final call

Just one step more and we fall
Guide us and please take our hands
Without you we're weak and alone

Save us, from the dogs of war
Save us, from the creeping nightmares
Save us, from the evil's course
Save us, from our own ignorance
Save us, from the man in black
Save us, from the desolation
Save us, from the hate attack

I will never make the mistake and give it back
When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back

There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before

When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
And I reveal what I have loved before

There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do

All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone

Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
See his strong hands
But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
See the drunk man, try to ask him why

He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
There's a fight in his head he cannot win
Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin

You... you cannot hide
You... you cannot describe your feelings inside

Be my guide help me through!

Everything that has gone wrong
Mighty plans in the right direction
But very little has been done
Everyday when I try to get forward
I find myself another mile back
Help me fighting!
Help me breathing!
Why am I falling down instead?

Every useful minute seems to be the thought of you
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!

In the night
Sometimes I cried after all I lied to you

Free from ourselves and free from this world we may find
The freedom we search
'Cause all that we need is inside!
The hours we waste we may not get back for a while
And when it gets dark
No chance will be there for a try

When I wake up early in the morning
I catch a book and jump inside
I fill my head with a million wonders
And try to fill the night with light

And always when I think I'm nearer

A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free
If I don't want to know, what's written inside me
How could I see anything, how could I be anything?

Restless minds have searched, long before
The truth will be the same, for evermore
The mightiness of trees, that you can feel
Can give you all you need, just listen still

Here is love and there is pain
It's all around, it's all the same
There's nothing new that I could tell to you

But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts
We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything, that is and has been and will be

There is a long way to go, there is a high place to know
There is a world to go through, but there's so much more to do

Sometimes you're wrong by some things you have done
You see fate is too strong, nothing's won
No use for a fight if you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size like a live

It's the rise and fall, the prize for all
That's ain't nice at all, luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain

A little dragon could spit fire but never so for something bad
He didn't know the knight's desire to throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet but their parents told them stop
And then it all turned out peculiar he couldn't get it up

And it's all in vain when you're living with pain
Reap not goods you have grown by your own
Feelings your like, disappear over night
You sip up every grin free to win

It's the rise and fall, the prize for all
That's ain't nice at all, luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
You nearly go insane

A spaceman files the rocket, well that takes him to the stars
Thinks his wife is in his pocket but she's strolling 'round in bars

They want to show you how to look like
How to be a star
But if you big-nosed without muscles
You are not attractive
You don't fit in what's so popular
Four pounds too much without a suntang
Self-respect is fading
They already tooked away your pride
California dreamgirl with her brain down in her pussy
You will never reach her you're too small

Wake up all you idiots don't close your eyes
And see there is only one thing you can be
This is just you and nothing else
Start to believe all in yourself
Stop to running after visions you don't need

Who is in the mirror
Do you really trust this face
Smiles at you so bad and ugly
This is not yourself anymore
Will a soul feel well in plastic bodies
Where it don't belong
Silicon and lifted faces
Don't you really know who you are

Don't try to hide
If you don't look like monroe
The smile on your face this is real
Just be yourself that's the deal

California dream man
With a smile made out of plastic
Juicy woman dreams that you can buy
Selling you a dream so far away
And so fantastic until you realise you won't get high

Now you're close to suicide
Your dream bursts like a bubble
All the gossip you once liked is gone
Your addiction to be skinny is driving you to madness
I hope now you can see what you have done",Silicon Dreams [*]

I want it all don't wanna fall

(walk your way) don't let them change you
You are here to live and what you take you've got to give

(walk your way) it's just a satellite* from your heart

Life is such a game, don't give it up

I'm asking there
And we all seem to share

Helloween,"Tried so hard to understand all of your feelings
Tried to cope with your insanities
Come to think about too many ways of healing
What we lost or maybe never had

One small step into the hidden decoy
One more world is help and one will destroy

I woke up in the midnight sun
So aware damage has been done
Agony or sanctuary
Only fate will show the way

From the bright of day into the jaw of darkness
One is shoved, a victim of lie
Friendly face turns into a fiery grimace
Suddenly feelings learn to die

Used up sympathy no chance to return
To a world one know but would's that will burn

Spent more time in the midnight sun
Still aware of what else has gone
Agonized and hypnotized
When will I be shown the way

Fell asleep and no midnight sun
Still aware justice has been done
No more doubts but disbelief
When the night was day

And fate did show the way",Midnight Sun

Push your real intention

Push your private fiction

There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen

We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been

With new minds made so clean
Checked up on a screen
They will be the saints
Without them we might all fail

[Chorus]
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Guardians of our lives
Take care eternally

Grab your mask and don't be late

Well disguised heat and fever in the air tonight

Little ghost's are makin'lotsa noise

Ah it's tonight 

Someone's sitting in a field,
Never giving yield
Sitting there with gleaming eyes
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise

You think linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie

On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream on Halloween

Where am I now
Is there anybody out there
What has happened
Am I in heaven

I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining
It's shining so bright
It's shining on me, yeah

I am the one, doom 's in my hands
Now make your choice,
Redeemed or enslaved

I'll show you passion and glory?
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man

Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind's
Deliverance and peace of mind

You knocked on heaven's door

From a distance, after sorrow

Life's like walking
On a high wire
You slipped away
I've seen you dying in a vein
High as a mountains seem all the problems that I have
But when I hear your voice Far away out of the dark
You just go on and on in the back of my mind

I don't wanna

Do you really care?
Tell me you really care!

Hey! Don't you blame me! Don't you touch me!
Won't you ever leave me be?

Remove all the stones from our hearts

And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind so do as divined

Put on your armor ragged after fights
Hold up your sword you're leaving the light
Make yourself ready for the lords of the dark
They'll watch your way so be cautious, quiet and hark

You hear them whispering in the crowns of the trees
You're whirling 'round but your eyes don't agree
Will of the wisps misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse without takin' their wrath

Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that satan who won't let us be
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that satan who won't let us be, kill

You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

You can feel cold sweat running down your neck
And the dwarfs of falseness throw mud at your back
Guided by spells from the old seer's hands
You're suffering pain only steel can stand

Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway

You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

Throw the first key into the sea of hate

Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belongs into the sea of greed
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance


Disease disease, disease my friend
For this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease disease, disease my friend
Throw the key or you may die

Disease disease, disease my friend
For this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease disease, disease my friend
Throw the key or you may die

On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He is sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He is playing you out with delight

Man who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven stars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be
Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key, throw the key
Throw the key

An earthquake squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming and earth swallowing him away

You're the keeper of the seven keys
You locked up the seven seas
And the seer of visions can now rest in peace
There ain't no more demons and no more disease
And mankind live up, you're free again
Yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown
You have given our souls back to light

Won the Big Don to be her lover
Had to make him tell her his secrets
About his business and about his street-rats

She really was a damn good actress
Everybody called her 'Big Don's Mistress'

So he told her of a damned deceiver
Secured, in her he was a strong believer

How he suffered in the deepest abyss
But saw in her the wish for a new life
To escape from there and make her his wife

And if it wasn't for the circumstance and well against all odds
Well that's enough for feeling great the best we could have got
And just in case there's something wrong so much with you to share
Much better anyways than watch or stroll round everywhere

And asked if we could break apart as things ain't been too good
I swallowed hard and got that feel I know it's called unease
The confidence I've kept so well just came down piece by piece

That's all it takes it's sad but done no way to disagree
Time takes toll and that's the way it's always gonna be

'Cause it wasn't yet the circumstance but more than just a test
There's little left for feeling great and all I need's some rest
There's not a single glimpse of hope well someone took my place
It's yet another turn for me, i'll be messin' round everywhere

A template you can't choose

Love and desire, dry ice or fire
Don't you just want to flee their magic spell

No mercy for the nations two people are at war
Beliefs divide the dream they share of peace and harmony
Their eyes look up to heaven, address our god in prayers
Their souls exposed, they may decease by emperor's decree

You hear and you agree

We're all here for a reason
So we can't just hang around
There's so much left to see and learn
Make way for common ground

And those who head the wrong way
Will rate as minor class
As castaways they'll render fools
When the horsemen come to rule

Strike the last hour in their glass towers
Infinite lust has made the curtain fall

To find an answer and relief
I see a world so strange and cold
I see a world of rules and thieves
The day you're born you're under pressure
Your life is well prepared my friend
They surely teach you what to think how to behave until the end

All I ever wanted is a little piece of life
In a world where I decide things on my own
All I ever needed is a little piece of hope
And then things are gonna turn the other way

I'm living in a world of fantasy
Reality ain't good enough for me
And all that I can feel is nothing but sobriety

I'm living in a world of fantasy
Reality ain't meant or made for me
All that I see is so unreal

And once you're old enough they teach you
Not to be wishful not to care
About the plan that's been already made for you by other hands
But when you fail there's no one out there
To take your hand to catch your tears
The whole construction we have built leaves no such room for blinding fears

I wonder I wonder if I can carry the weight of the world",World of Fantasy

Won't hide away I can make it for sure

For they had what it takes to lead a good life
Foremen believed it’s because of some secrets
They brought the fight and it never ended

Petra will fall to the Great

You came so far
Now gone you are
Oh Nabataea
You morning star
Now so afar

Some always try to reign with fire
So are the seals, hence the old Nabateans
Have disappeared under the wire

Now gone you are

Unique in your time
Petra, 2000 years on we still
Suffer the same crimes
Petra, today we’re trying hard
To reach your paradigm

We say no
To the ultra-extreme
No, we say no
To the killers of dreams
No

Soon we all will disappear
Children, children don’t you cry
Make no sound or we will die

Children, children have no fear
Soon we all will disappear
Children, children don’t you cry
Make no sound or we will die

Once there was a land midst of the chaos
Floating like an island in old blood
People lived in peace, there was no hunger
Though they had no slaves, believe it or not

Once there was a nation without soldiers
Never brought a war to other lands
They lived without king or queen or ruler
Once there was the first democracy

You came so far
Now gone you are
Oh Nabataea
You morning star
Now so afar

A mean pack of sinners, no saints 
Sons of Satan and black is our paint
Warriors of Sodom, metalheads unite 
We are the ratpack, won't back for a fight

So sound asleep you wish you were not on your own
We're the devil in a black dress, now look at the seeds we've sown

We don't want your bullshit here and we never cared anyway",Rat Pack
Helltrain,"There's a circle of claws and a sharks shaped jaws
Go for the kill before paying the bill
You'd better watch your back - wear the wizard's hat
It's coming up fat - the rot n roll attack

[Pre-chorus:]
Oh hey - feel it squeezing all your bones
Hell yeah - feel it pissing right down your fucking throat

[Chorus:]
I am all evil, vicious and old - I've laid down my soul to the gods rot n roll

A million ways or so they say
You're going down - the king has lost his crown
Step in the ring, we're the knockout kings
So fucking THAT, the rot n roll attack

Helltrain,"I'd better step into my boots - keep shocking, a box of red wine keeps my head up rocking
A big pack of kicks and I'll go again

You'd better start to wake up baby, a few more miles and then we'll maybe...
See the shores that we call our home again

[Pre-chorus:]
Do you dare to call the sins of a tifetime? S.O.S - you've got to gamble to win

[Chorus:]
It's a time warp, feel it on the sidewalk, it's a sin, it's a second of skin
It's a time warp, feel it on the sidewalk, s.o.s - you've got to gamble to win

I'd better run away from home - keep rocking, like the soldier on his own
So fucking arrogant to ask for death again

It's like running with a gun, sleep safely, going out there on my own, honestly...
Does any of this make fucking sense?

Helltrain,"Damage done and the seventh son, 
Holy hell we are sleepless
Comatose red in the serpent's bed, 
Hell we are dying in fever

Dinner's served on silver plates,
One last gasp of freedom
Before going out to kill the snake,
In search of holy kingdoms

What do you want from me? A life of peace and harmony?
I just wanna rage and all, a hundred years and then I'll go

Come close and watch the downfall, 
Like pigs in filth we crawl
Living life tied up in chains, prayers, 
Morals, stupid games

One last call to the mighty halls of sanity and wisdom
One last kiss and then we'll miss, these times of freedom",Sleepless

Hell, I can't escape
Can someone tell me what is going on?
Working for pennies, singing a song

Like in wasteland
Eyes cold dead buried and gone
And I don't want it
No more than moving to Tombstone

Someone told me only death is real
Well...what the fuck do I feel?
Like this would be a fairytale?
This life is fucked-up, can you tell?

Got my booze and that's all I need
For a hell of a time
Hell of a time!

Six o'clock in the morning my head is spinning
Here we go again
I'm walking the line one day at a time
For that goddamn man
Can't wait till they bury him, six feet down

I've got my pride and I've got my will
I ain't fuckin' around
I was born to lose but I'm built for booze
Cant' wait to knock them down

Gotta get to the weekend
Gotta make it to Friday night
Friday night yeaah

It's just the good ol' boy in me
I got my friends I got the recipe

I got my girl, got my family
Got my booze and that's all I need
For a hell of a time
Hell of a time!

Gotta take the red eye
Till Sunday night yeaah

I got everything I need
Just as long as I can stay high

Come on!

Got my booze and that's all I need

Drinking whiskey down by the creek

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Cast your stones and stand against
Everything your god's spoken.

Inside your head the screams won’t silence
I remember those days
The terror past our home, the fear that’s in your bones,
It just won’t go away, no.

The strangle holds, the insulting names,
The wound up shirt around his fist, the nose to nose beer stinking breath.
Thrown down onto the floor, so battered, bruised and sore
Choke down on the truth of it, and touch it until you break your neck

Hell’s where I was born! Hell’s where I was raised,
This hell is where I’m from and this hell is where I’ll stay.
The hush is all I need, to hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams
Just be still and pray, and let the noise just fade away.

Retain to violence
Atop your heart like a secret closet,
So no one can penetrate
You just can’t stand the touch, affection weighs too much,
You push everyone away from

The reckoning! The bitter stings,
Whipped so bad I pissed myself still with a beating stub held belt
If this reminds you of home, you better know you’re not alone
Hold the gun up to my head, I'll pull the trigger on myself!

Hell’s where I was born! Hell’s where I was raised,
This hell is where I’m from and this hell is where I’ll stay.
The hush is all I need, to hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams

You didn’t want to know! You didn’t want to know!
These are the memories we keep
We don’t want to show! We don’t want to show!

So heavy they lie, with all the pain that they bring
My life is full of longing, but for what I'll never know
I've been drawn in to the fire as I reap what I sow

Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away,

Falling down my heart attacks,

No more hope, no more trust,

Disgust, hate

I'm not a hero, or a villain,
Not a god, I'm just a man,

At the footprints in the sand,
I'm stripping off my armor,
My battles here are done,
Wave my white flag to surrender and fly into the sun

Como todos
Procuramos el momento ms obscuro

Para hablarnos
Para darnos el ms dulce de los besos
Recordar de qu color son los cerezos
Sin hacer mas comentarios, somos novios",Somos Novios
Helmut Lotti,"Yo adivino el parpadeo
de las luces que a lo lejos
van marcando mi retorno.

Son las mismas que alumbraron
con sus palidos reflejos
hondas horas de dolor.

Y aunque no quise el regreso
siempre se vuelve
al primer amor.

La vieja calle
donde me cobijo
tuya es su vida
tuyo es su querer.

Bajo el burlon
mirar de las estrellas
que con indiferencia
hoy me ven volver.

Volver
con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo
platearon mi sien.

Sentir
que es un soplo la vida
que veinte anos no es nada
que febril la mirada
errante en las sombras
te busca y te nombra.

Vivir
con el alma aferrada
a un dulce recuerdo
que lloro otra vez.

Tengo miedo del encuentro
con el pasado que vuelve
a enfrentarse con mi vida.

Tengo miedo de las noches
que pobladas de recuerdos
encadenen mi sonar.

Pero el viajero que huye
tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

Y aunque el olvido
que todo destruye
haya matado mi vieja ilusion,

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna
de mi corazon.

Volver
con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo

And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way

Ruck and Rock, taking you up a notch higher

I mean, it was cool aht first yunno
Jus yunno, rapping about nuhthing
Buht then like whut happened wuz
[B.C.C.] The people they started, yunno to talk about tings that make sense
[B.C.C.] I wuz like ""What the fuck?""
[B.C.C.] People with real shit I wuhlike ""Get the fuck outta here""
[B.C.C.] Whaddo they think they doing?
[B.C.C.] I dunno where that shit come from man.
[B.C.C.] I wuz like, ""Yo it's fuckin amazing"" right?
[B.C.C.] Real
[B.C.C.] It's real, I don even know how the shit start

Verse One: Rock, Ruck

It went down like this, one little nigga snuck through the door
Peeped the scene, sniped a few, then crept through with two more
Heads were gettin nervous, that's three now they want to break North
Too late -- five more tore the door straight the fuck off
It's on now; gettin down in the trenches
Eight soldiers gettin in mo' ass than splinters on raggedy benches
Since it's war, ain't shit sweet this Clique
disperse and then they transform to chess pieces

On fake grounds never spare clowns
Ruck and Rock be the rooks hold the square down
Are you prepared now I tear down, any opponent who similies
Styles buckwild meanwhile your ass I obliterate
Demonstrate, tactics you need practice
First of all your monkey-ass rhyme like you're backwards
I should smash kids, when they try to get beyond
limits, timid, but they could never get with Sean (say word)
Dat's word, Sean don't give a
Whatevah then they got niggaz who're snakes that slither (hisssss)
And if ya, want to come test the inflixter
I got your name number address plus your picture

Chorus:

This is the B.C.C., N Double D
In the Ninety-Now we lock it down
This is the B.C.C., N Double D
In the Ninety-Now we lock it down

Verse Two: Ruck, Rock

Peep my words, yes my heavenly words, word
that get niggaz locked up in seventy-third
Prefer to chill, but the Sun can't do that
Due to my temperature tempted to bring it where your crew's at
You lack with the skills that it takes to make
ends meet cause it seems that your ass is weak
My occupation's, Operation, Lockdown
On your radio station whoever got the hot sound

Who wan tess y'all?
Mr. Mall-Doo, a.k.a. Rock-Ness y'all
Guard your chest y'all
Nothing can protect y'all
From Buckshot on down to the rest y'all
We runnin through your set y'all
Fuck the rest y'all, we be the best y'all
Yesh yesh y'all
I crack backs North South East and West y'all
We know fresh y'all
I did do I guess y'all
I didn't say I doesn't indeed sex I never measure
Ready to wet y'all
Place your bottom dollar bets y'all
Chest will become messed bored if you flex y'all
Nevertheless y'all
We out to save the ship before it's dead y'all
Lock it down with the full court press y'all

Chorus: 2X

Ha ha ha haaa

You know me as

Popey chuno stickin dick to yo chick coolo
Hard to kill like the white boy had to snatch a MC off the rap back
For the simple fact he's wack so what's the deal?
I feel you can't step to Sean
Wiggin out on bitch ass nigga's since Decepticons (Transform!)
The plan's on but I wish Mary J. Blidge remind me
Take my hoodie off nigga I can't see behind me
Why these guys chose to defy laws
Of the most high most guys get they shit wrapped in gauze
Place to be is on my side 
Motherfuck ya pride, lay undercover from big Ruck
If ya monkey ass want to survive 

[Rock]
Yo and if you think that's hectic it gets worse when Rock's up in it
So somebody tell the fat lady she's up in five minutes
Shit is almost finished right after I take care of witnesses 
Roamin the primises not mindin they businesses
And bitches up in yo melon tellin you to jet
You know if you stay 
I might give you some chest pains like  cigarretes
Bet ya bottom dollar don't move or swaller
You not promised tomorrow but I promise you I'll make ya holler
Pop you coller
Bone stone's the way that I stalk in my zone 
You can roam just don't get caught
Place to be is on my side duke
Cause you don't want to be the target when I fly the coupe

Devils that try to ban me that dare would be bare proof
Who's he? stalking the streets when there's no life
Eyes glow like tiko night glows, we's in flight

I bring rec in this game, and don't shit change
I inflicts pain like a stressed brain having a migraine
Heads talk trash, walk in paths like anorexic

Burgling, make me wonder why I'm not sleep walking
Peeps talking, I hear 'em as I walk by, but they all die
I'm fortified with the 45
Fuck it! Let me proceed with the mission
No need for intermission, I need trees in my system
Cut down through mart, then I head for brisk in park
With my P 'n' C, for some yard to spark
No need to get hyper, I see, C, Cypher
Power on the corner fucking with my niggas, every hour
I devour, niggas who wanna test me and defy me
It might be Giuliani or the illuminati

Penetrate through darkness bounce like I'm sonar

Ain't no smiling, we up against the odds like Phil Collins
Meanwhile, I still be wilding, but only smarter (what?)
Peep me the irrational and the quiet riot starter
Pardon this, I see you're not the sharpest pencil in the box
No where near a match, you get smashed by a Rock
I done seen 3 dollar bills and you faker
And you wonder why I hate ya

I need a doctor to check my, my brain

As I think back, to the nineties
That's when life got extra grimy
Multiplied with a fleet behind me
Wasn't smart to try me, physical fam gave less than a
Which added on to eighties anger tearing through my inner
(Now we're gettin' somewhere, yeah) It's all becoming clear
I always feared I have to play the rear til I was outta here
That's when I flipped out and became a plane
That transform into a robot Rokk Da Kids was his name
(One of them Decep niggaz) Yup takin' dope clothes and then some
I bend some (did you have any legal source of income?)
I said farewell to welfare crazy long ago
They want you to work for them peanuts now
Man you need a shrink if you think I'ma go (huh)
Then any thoughts and hopes of rehabilitation
Were chilled when I lost my nigga Phil it's been downhill
Ever since, and ain't nobody helpin' me
So I came to you, the Doctor Killpatients for therapy

Bust the prognosis, better yet Duke have a dosage
of prescribed poetry that people perceive as potent
I've been goin through your file and I found a conclusion
That you destined to be the best in this world of confusion
You lose when you fall victim to evil ways
I know crime pays but the rhyme slays nowadays
Take two of these and if you have a problem at all
I'm on call twenty-four hours to brawl, word is bond

[Chorus]

This is my number, ya know what I'm sayin'
Four nine five, nevermind nevermind

[Chorus]

But you that undisputed, and now you therapeutic
Bootcampian champion

[Chorus]

The undisputed, with therapeutic
Bootcampian champion, R-O-C, therapy

Bust the scrimmage, I call the high post play
Dish off to the center fo' da quick lay
Slay, anybody come in my lane
Gets blown out the frame by the Flipster and lames, look
Who is this gettin' swift with this pugilist
Equipped with the lyrical gift to flip scripts
People duck sick (what?) don't want to touch with that ruff [shit]
That Ruck kick, break boys bones like Roy Jones

Heltah Skeltah,"Aye yo I'm Sean Price I'm six foot one
Dark skinned stocky build with a big gun
Sick sons are the ones with the lump sums
Stick guns get funds make your chick come
My chick done said she like the way I toke blunts
Drink liquor write scriptures and my gold fronts
Plus the way my pants hang make her wonder how
My baggy jeans stay up baby I'm well endowed
See its ill I know you wasn't expectin that
Or figure Ruck messin with chicks make an executive trap
They get better than that she don't care who I bone
Long as I treat her right and bring my black ass home

Hey the name is Alban baby but call me what you wanna
Nowhere near ugly but some call me Rockness Monstah
I'm the heathen you was warned about by your momma
That'll never love you as much as I love my marijuana
Hang out from sundown to sun up startin a ton of drama
With thugs snake me one time they will harm ya
Still you goodie goodie chicks be all attracted to my karma
Lets be friends some other time right now I'm tryin to get behind ya
She responded she better stop listenin to momma
Love my rugged steez and my whole aura was the bomber
Asked to see my scar and taxed it 
Felt my six pack then asked
If she could drink it through my straw before I hit that

I know I got a good woman on my team
I used to have five chickens and I tricked mad cream
But the first one I met yo she was actin wack
And the second one got dissed cause she was smokin smack
But the third was a herb you could tell that she's
On some bull cause she flipped when she smelled my weed
But the fourth one heard the PJs looked mean
Got with the fifth chick because she cooked and cleaned

My question is why do nice chicks love rugged dudes
The whole thought puzzles me I'm just glad they do
They got they own loot unlike these upside down 3 or 4s
Silly rabbit tricks give up all they dough
Not I hell nah yo check my track record bravo
Don't eat coochie shorty understand I'm too macho
Daytime act like saints but they can't fool me
G the freak come out of them at night like we Whodini
The Freaks Come Out at Night

Trying to make shit happen  fuck you 

Aiyyo we fight every night  now that's not kosher 
I reminisce with bliss  before Eshkoshkah 
We was closer  later on you was supposed ta

Every day it get worse  than the day before 
Maybe you're  actin too  immature 
Insecure, plus I'm lookin for the cure 
Keep flippin like you do I'm lookin at the door..

You dealin with a nigga who, can say what he means 
and mean what he say 
When I say I'm lookin at the door bitch I'm obvious 
Straight up and down 
The fuck I look like to you huh what? 

And when you wit your friends I slide to the side 
until the spotlight is mine, and always rep God Cipher Divine 
When I, did the knowledge all my wisdom it came 
to an understanding that you underhanded and lame 
I should play some stuck-up rapper role 
And get foul everytime you lose control 
But that's not my order of operation 
Bustin nuts in ya, startin our own population

Fuck, my shit ain't good, what? 
The fuck is you doin, punk ass bitch? 

My friends always tell me I'm lucky to stay 
dipped with the flyest chick from the B.K. 
But all the games you play make a nigga want to spray 
So every night to the most high a nigga pray 
that me and my shorty make it to another day 
If not fuck it Ruckus it wasn't meant to go that way 
But hey I can't front it was good while it lasted 
until I asked her some old stupid hood rat shit 
Some left field shit that a nigga can't call 
But all in all, I had a ball 
I guess it's better to have loved, and to have lost 
Than to never have love at all

[Chorus]
Iz you wit me, yo throw your hands in the air! 
All my thugs and soldiers  fuck it even players 
Whether you hate us or you show us love 
No matter what you do money  stack your gunz 'n onez 
Iz you wit me, yo throw your hands in the air! 
All my thugs and soldiers  fuck it even players 
Crooks, willies, pimps, all my sons 
No matter what you do baby, stack your gunz 'n onez 

Yo, light another, and elevate on this one my brother 
Respect mine like my baby mother 
I shine when it rain, the sky's cryin' for all the black youth 
That's dyin', I heard he went out clutchin' his iron 
And in the mist the slugs flyin', one burst 
He kissed the dirt, not knowin' he was touched at first 
Or badly hurt, it's all science, another nigga merked 
Kid snatched his purse and his work, left nuttin' 
But the shells on the turf, the situation's worse 
A lot of bitch ass niggaz is comin' out they skirts 
Cause it's real, not everyone can rhyme and get a deal 
Not everyone can shine and make a meal 
So Johnny carry nine in the steel, one in the head 
For all them fuckheads, leave that ass for dead nuff said 
Don't be mistaken, or mislead, it's all peace 
But when my baby's gotta get fed, I'm all teeth 
Bitin' down on the bullet now, bloodshed 
I cop my herb from a knotty dread, and live this life 
On the edge nigga, one time for your fuckin-ass mind 
Cause-o, can you deal? 

[Chorus]

Wu-Tang are you wit me, well throw your hands in the air! 
All my soldiers, thugs, fuck it even players 
Heads on lock down and those on the run 
No matter what you do money, stack your gunz 'n onez 

Aiyyo peep the stamina, of the main brain splattera 
In a matter of seconds I'm disrespectin' your character 
What's the matter ya niggaz ain't ready for the massacre 
I'll be slappin' y'all niggaz in the face with the caliber 
You like the voice baby? Ruck is the choice lately 
Slap a hoe and then grab a hoe just like ? ? 
My boys pay me no mind, for the shit I say lately 
Then deep down in they heart, they think that nigga Ruck is crazy 
Maybe, y'all niggaz should just chill before I fuck you up 
I can snuff a duck nigga in the face with the uppercut 
What the fuck? y'all niggaz do it the mic ruin 
Your life by screwin', your wife now cruisin' 
Affect with the motherfuckin' grimy style

Remind me how, the way it used to be, yo you used to be 
Better than you is on the mic, but now you losing me

Son I used to be a good boy, fat cheeks, little cute kid 
Potentially rebellious yet a straight A student 
I listened to my elders til I found out they was stupid 
What they told me had me broke and bummy, time for some new shit 
Now, I hold mo' concealed Heat than Acapulco 
Ricans in Bushwick call me Rocko, el mano loco 
Got a fo'-fo' to make thugs sing like K-Ci and JoJo 
Packin' ever since Mamma Rock said gunz was a no-no 
We don't need those doe, street cats don't need gats 
Six-five, from the NBA, many niggaz be that 
So try me, like Mutumbo you can't get shit by me 
Send you to E.R. son with broke ankles like Allen Ivey, hehe 
Hold that thought for a minute 
And watch your shorty before I run up in it I admit it 
I'm like Sprite, image got you shaken, thinkin' I'm Jamaican 
But it's thirst that'll get your jewelry and dough taken 
Fuck Batman and Robin, I'm robbin with a bat man 
Chase niggaz like Chevy for makin' wack jams 
Hit hard as a dick after a lapdance, ask any Sean Price 
In Alcatraz fan, they'll tell you watch the jabbin'

That wake the sea
The lightning that wakes up the ground
And my heart has been half asleep inside of me
It wakes up when you come around

I want to tell you, I've watched the moon
That trips the tide
The shadows that trip on the tree
And I'm wearing a blindfold, a shoelace untied
I'm steady when you're next to me

I've been half asleep all of my life
Lost in the dark of some perilous night
Is that you or some beautiful light

To be home again and I'm home again

And the stars keep shining but I'll never look back
Let the stars keep shining but I'll never look back

The map is tearing at the corners
I can't remember where I've been
The world unfolding while the highway takes me home again
And I'm home again, and I'm home again

And the stars keep shining but I'll never look back

A tremor in my bones at last light, something had begun
The light between the buildings didn't rise as high or strong
But slanted through the window like it did when days were long

The frost fell on the park when all the schoolboys went inside
The postman and policeman dropped their hat and clipped their stride
And wind stirs on the sidewalk and it hangs outside the door
Waiting on the summer while we lay right on the floor

But when I see over the avenues and when I know what I know
Just like the sleep when all our days are new
Below, singing asleep, I dreamt beside you
While my hand was letting go

You left a slight impression on the corner of the chair
If you were walking past it, you might never know it's there
If you were walking past it though and I was standing by
Oh, I was standing near to you as you were walking by

But when I see over the avenues and when I know what I know
Just like the sleep when all our days are new
Below, singing asleep, I dreamt beside you
While my hand was letting go
Asleep, I dreamt beside you while my hand was letting go

",While My Hand Was Letting Go

To lay for a while with you
I got shadows snapping at my tail
Who say I'm no damn good
But that's just halfway through
All that I'm good for is you

You know I play with all those strays
Prowling outside your door
It's the scraps of love you throw my way
That have got me on all fours, I think it's for you
All that I'm good for is you, all that I'm good for is you

And I'll leave it behind
To lay down with you
I'll stop running wild
Doing what I used to do

My whole wide world is out of hand
So crooked it leaves me cryin'
But your love is straight and narrow
And it's keeping me in line
This love will see me through
All that I'm good for is you
All that I'm good for is you

Someone's counting
Someone's leaving

There's fifty dollars on this pony
Chase him down these tracks
Well, won't nobody take my business
I'll teach you how to come back

I saw one hundred miles of steel over wood
And let him go
I filled my pockets up with coal black with mud
And let him go

I'll throw my hat off when I beat you
Find it when you're gone
There's a straw and cotton around the station
I'll make myself a new one

I held a silver dollar tight inside my fist
And let you go
I've counted all the things I've lost, that point to this
And let you go

A woman stares out at the sea

Enough to fall to our knees

Was driving everybody out of their brains
But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve 
And I pleaded I was being framed

Like a fool, now darling, all night long
Dance with me, now darling, to this song

Take me home in a big car - drive it slow
And if we turned off the highway, who would know
Who would know in the morning's yellow light
Where these two lost lovers were last night...","Dance with Me, Now Darling"

Since it's getting late 
Since you're half asleep 
And I couldn't wait 
For the tired sun 
With its tired light 
To wake up the world 
Just to see you tonight 

I know you don't believe me 
But I have something to tell you 
I know it's not so easy 
But Baby, hold me now 

If I have to leave 
Like I always do 
Will you look for me 
As I look for you 
In a passing glance 
From a passerby 
I could cross the world 
To be near you tonight 

I know you don't believe me 
But I have something to tell you 
I know it's not so easy 
But Baby, hold me now

Hem,"Wouldn't be the first time love made a fool of me
Wouldn't even care, but now you're here to see
It comes as no surprise
Just leave the light on

What I wouldn't give if you could have it all:
The sun that's going down
The bed that breaks the fall
The cradle and the bow
So you can take comfort now
You can take comfort now.

Sometimes a heart can break and make it's own relief
The way a cold dark night invites the fire thief
He wants to show us how
So we can take comfort now
We can take comfort now
We can take comfort now

Leave the light on.",The Fire Thief
Hem,"Sometimes when I lay down at night 
I swear I can see to heaven 
For it's in dreaming that the things 
I always knew 
are the only thoughts I have 
And when I look up at you, love 
Handsome as a magazine 
Wild as the sun, like nothing below 
could ever pull you down 

But it's a hard road that we follow 
The saddest cities, and the darkest hollows 

People cross this world 
Over and then back again 
Never even one time lift their eyes 
Or think of what they say 

But I hear it in your voice, love 
Like someone sweetly willing 
The hope of all these years, 
the prayer of a time 
that we don't even know 

But it's a hard road that we follow 
The saddest cities, and the darkest hollows 

But I hear it in your voice, love 
The strongest sound 
I've ever heard 
Like water from a well 
so deep in the ground 
I'll never thirst again 

But it's a hard road that we follow 
The saddest cities, and the darkest hollows 

And everything that's far away 
And was lost from me

Buying drinks for the room

Keep the memory from tearing in two

But if I should lose
I'd wake up feeling lucky
If I should take a fall
Or throw it all away
I wouldn't mind lying beside you

And spend some time inside it

We'll wash up at a corner bar
Because leaving here is just too hard for me

Just lay here listening to the radio
Upstairs, hiding from the world below

On lawn chairs spread across the tableland
Somewhere flowerbeds to lay your hand in mine
If you stay then I will, time fading on the dial

I will always love you like I do
I'll always love you like I do
The song is fading still it's true
When I'm here beside you

You said you want a wing to fly
A loose thread hanging from the gingham sky
We knew that we would have to say goodbye
C'mon, if you would then I'd stay
The sun pulling in the driveway

I will always love you like I do
I'll always love you like I do

Hem,"In the summer of my wedding
As the corn burned in the field
Oh, I lay down for my baby
And let the sweet smoke stain my heels

Well, I lay there till the midnight
When the dogs, they run through town
And I rose up just to listen
And I never lay back down

Then the morning, it came upon me
And I set my soul to search
From the tall grass down the main road
To the stained glass at the church

Lord my shepard help me pray
Though I left my heart to stray
Though I left my heart untrue
I can follow, I do, I do

And I can name them in my dreaming
I can set my soul to rest
I can chain them to my body
Let them settle at my breast

Now see them coming to my wedding
Where I will teach them not to stray
Oh, they'll carry my salvation
Oh, they'll carry me away

But I still can't see the shore
The only thing I know for sure

I wait for the sun

Now the day is growing dark
The waves come break on the foam
I prayed for you and there you are beside me
And I see tonight, I'm almost home
",Almost Home
Hem,"I found a well
Lost for many years
It tasted sweet
I soaked my feet
And I was on my way

I could see him from the main road
In the flames of the motel
A darkened sky that carried my farewell

I traveled south
Across the Iron Bridge
I passed the signs
And tangled vines
And I was on my way

Sent him voices on a postcard
So he wouldn't know I'd gone
A folded bird who all my words fell on

Said, no sunlight on your window
No movement on your wall
Strip away these sad old curtains
And hear me call

It was a year
When I thought of him
Where I had gone
What I had done
And I was on my way

In the fall I dreamt of rescues
And my eyes began to burn
One final lie that swallowed my return

There's no hero at your window
There ain't no postcards on your wall
I'll strip away these sad old curtains
We hear you call

Hem,"(Steve Curtis)

He came to meet me
On some July morning
He said he missed me
He came without warning
We walked for half a day
Got lost in my neighborhood
Came back another way
Just like I knew we would
And he came to meet me

He had some stories
He knew a few of mine
I had not heard his voice
For such a long time
My mind would race a bit
Come back to where we stood
I could not keep hold of it
Although I knew I should
And he came to meet me

I'd seen this whole day
Like it was drawing near
Sometimes I'd pray for it
Sometimes I'd shake with fear
Sometimes the only thought
That kept me in the night
Was one that I'd forgot
In summer's blinding light
And he came to meet me

I wrote myself a song
I could not speak what I'd done
He could've been here all along
He could've been anyone
But there is no one who
Could wake my heart like this
Could break my world in two
I felt a suddenness
I felt a suddenness
The day fell completely still
The dream was a lot like this
But I never knew until




",He Came to Meet Me
Hem,"I'll lay my head in a stranger's town
All on a summer's day
A tangled web when the lights went down
And the sun came up far away

And so over the great blue oceans
And then over the cities filled with light
I know we'll be together tomorrow
Oh, but I'll dream of you tonight

I cast about like an awkward guest
Toward a park across town
I felt the sky open up right inside my chest
And your voice like a trembling sound

Saying over the great blue oceans
And then over the cities filled with light
I know we'll be together tomorrow
Oh, but I'll dream of you tonight

Well, the world gets quiet in an ordinary minute
In the middle of the afternoon
We cross the street in the course of a day
And our eyes fix miles away

The bird on a windowsill
He sings like a bell, like lonesome lovers do
I'm sure as ever now, I'm scared as hell
I'm coming home to you

Singing over the great blue oceans
And then over the cities filled with light
I know we'll be together tomorrow

The sun is just pouring out
And everything is out of sight

And it's not fair

There's nobody out tonight
Nobody's hanging 'round

And now it's just empty lots around you

And they don't know
What you hold dear
And they can't see

Old Adam the crow
He's building a home in your field
Where bitter weeds grow all around the corn
Will you be the father
That drives the thief from your home
Or let him run wild at your first born

To carve out a home in this world
And I carried the bow to protect the corn
Summer is over
My hands are tired and slow
And I can't stop loving my first born

And you will never know what makes him run

We could only keep on moving

But what can keep us moving forward
Now that there's nothing left to burn, anyhow
What will keep you next to me, my love
Since it's too late to turn back now

I caught your face in the reflection
I thought I recognized the corner of your smile
A tired light from your direction

Hendrik Meurkens,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Henri Chaix,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes

Sworn enemy of love

Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,

Henri Crolla,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

But that was long ago

Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Henri René,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good"
Henri Salvador,"Refrain:
Quand je mont', je mont', je mont', je mont'  chez toi
J'ai le coeur qui saut',
Qui saut', qui saut' de joie
Et dans le petit escalier
Qui n'en finit pas de monter
J'aime, j'aime, j'aime, j'aime venir chez toi
Même, même, si c'est haut chez toi
Aussi ne t'étonn's pas si j'ai le coeur qui bat
Quand je mont', je mont',
Je mont', je mont', chez toi...
Tu n'as qu'un petit septièm' de banlieue
Et tout près d'un lit de bois
Un joli carré de ciel toujours bleu
Qui s'allume sur les toits...
Là haut je sais que tu m'attends
Et je prends tout mon temps...",Quand Je Monte Chez Toi

Je me désespère
Vivement qu'on m'enterre

Dieu me l'a fait
J'ai le hoquet, j'ai le hoquet, j'ai le hoquet.

Dis à belle-maman de s'amener bien vite:
Rien que de regarder sa sinistre binette
En une demi seconde le pire hoquet s'arrete

Faut pas te moquer
De mon hoquet
J'ai l'air toqué, j'ai l'air toqué, j'ai l'air toqué
Mais je ne peux plus m'arreter
Je suis suffoqué
Peut-etre que je vais claquer.

Baby baby baby le remède opère
T'as bien fait d'aller me chercher ma belle-mère
Je l'ai vue entrer dans notre appartement
Et son oeil féroce m'a retourné le sang:
J'ai plus le hoquet et je re-rock and roll
Et je veux danser avec Martine Carole

J'ai plus l'hoquet
ca c'est OK
ca me choquait, ca me choquait, ca me choquait
Comme une boule de croquet

Henri Salvador,"Marianne, oh, Marianne, oh, won't you marry me?

White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me

Henri Salvador,"Mon amie, que je suis triste
Quand le jour va se lever
Car il va falloir que je te quitte
Et retourner travailler
A travers la jalousie

Et sous sa caresse, tu l'éveilles,
Et ton sourire c'est mon soleil à moi
Je vais partir pour l'usine
Je vais chauffer les fourneaux
Mais je pense à ma câline
Qui m'attend dans son hameau

Est chargée de mes baisers
Et si tu te penches à ta fenetre,
Amie très chère tu peux les attraper.


C'est cinq heures à la sirène
Je repose mes outils
Je vais retrouver ma jolie reine
C'est maintenant que je vis
Elle a mis sa jupe blanche
Une fleur à ses cheveux
Nous irons tous deux 
Au p'tit café de Marie Blanche
Comme deux amoureux
Une mazurka commence
Et je te prends dans mes bras
Je me grise de la danse

Entendu sur le grand lit

Et je mordrai ta peau de peche

Minnie petite souris je vais te donner du gâteau
Viens voir petite souris comme il est bon comme il est gros

Avec du chocolat, petite souris sors de ton trou !

Lâche d'abord le marteau
Qui est caché derrière ton dos


Minnie petite souris je t'ai gardé un croque-monsieur
Viens voir petite souris y a du jambon c'est délicieux
Et le marteau n'était destiné qu'à planter un clou
Viens donc te régaler, petite souris sors de ton trou !

Vas d'abord mettre ailleurs le piège
Qui est à l'intérieur.

Minnie petite souris je n'ai que de bons sentiments
Viens voir petite souris ce beau morceau de parmesan
Et pour le piège crois-moi je te jure, je n'étais pas dans le coup
Le parmesan est là, petite souris sors de ton trou !

Alors lâche le matou
Que tu tiens par la peau du cou


Minnie petite souris puisque souvent tu bois mon vin
Viens boir' petite souris cette bonne bouteille de Chambertin
Si j'avais pris le chat c'était pour lui couper le cou
Viens trinquer avec moi, petite souris sors de ton trou !

Si tu veux boire un verre
T'as pas besoin d'un revolver,


Minnie petite souris puisque tu aim's ce qui est bon 
J'ai un poulet rôti est-c'que tu sens comme il sent bon
Le revolver tu vois c'est parce que j'ai peur des filous
Viens donc manger tout ça, petite souris sors de ton trou !

Alors si tu m'invites
Planque la cartouche de dynamite.
Idiot ! fais attention ! Tu vas faire sauter la maison !
Attention !","Minnie Petite Souris (Pepino, the Italian Mouse)"

Des habits qui me vont mal
Et je retourne au pays

Et je sens battre mon coeur
Car je retourne au pays

Fasciné par mon rêve, je me fouille et je prends
Un peu d'argent
Je le donne au marchand, très content qui me tend

Et sans tarder me suis mis à souffler

Quand j'ai joué :

Ont décidé de venir à Saint-Ouen

Sans s'ménager
On a fini par arriver à jouer

Les voiles du bateau qui s’en allaient aux îles
Etaient de la couleur de tes yeux ce matin
La couleur du printemps dans les vallées fertiles
Province du bonheur à tout jamais certain
Quand le bateau partait, j’allais sur la jetée
Et quand j’étais bien sûr qu’on ne le voyait plus
J’attendais les yeux clos la fin de la journée
Pour le plaisir cruel de me sentir perdu
D’avoir pour un instant des nageoires ou des ailes
De survoler la terre et de vaincre le vent
Monter jusqu’aux étoiles et cueillir la plus belle
Les deux bras étendus, devenir cerf-volant

Devenir si léger que le plus faible brise
Vous emporte au-delà de tous les équateurs
Alors tout est parfait, les folies sont permises
On refait le chemin des oiseaux migrateurs
En suivant du regard ce beau vaisseau tranquille
Tout seul sur la jetée, j’inventais mon destin
Mais la couleur du ciel, de la mer ou des îles
Ne valait pas l’éclat de tes yeux ce matin",Les Voiles du Bâteau

Paroles de Boris Vian / Musique de Henri Salvador
Copyright Editions Henri Salvador

J'ai longtemps parcouru son corps 
Effleuré cent fois son visage 
J'ai trouvé de l'or 
Et même quelques étoiles en essuyant ses larmes 
Et j'ai appris par coeur la pureté de ses formes 
Parfois je les dessine encore 
Elle fait partie de moi 

Je veux juste une dernière danse 
Avant l'ombre et l'indifférence 
Un vertige puis le silence 
Je veux juste une dernière danse 

Je l'ai connue trop tôt mais c' est pas de ma faute 
La flèche a traversé ma peau 
C'est une douleur qui se garde 
Qui fait plus de bien que de mal 
Mais je connais l'histoire, il est déjà trop tard, 
Dans son regard, on peut apercevoir qu'elle se prépare 
Au long voyage 

Je peux mourir demain ça ne change rien 
J'ai reçu de ses mains 
Le bonheur ancré dans mon âme 
C'est même trop pour un seul homme 
Et je l'ai vue partir sans rien dire 
Il fallait seulement qu'elle respire 
Merci d'avoir enchanté ma vie",La Dernière Danse

Et tu as suivi le sillage

Le clochard
Sur une bouche de métro
S'étend pour avoir chaud
L'air misérable
Le clochard
D'une vieille boîte en fer blanc
Retire quelques croissants
Et se met à table
Le clochard
Embrassant sa bouteille
Boit longuement le soleil
Des pauvres diables
Puis l’clochard
Fume son dernier mégot
En regardant là-haut
Vers le ciel noir

Le clochard
A quoi peut-il penser
Peut être à son passé
Qui peut le dire
Dans un bar
De l'autre côté de la rue
Y'a un drôle de chahut
Des chants, des rires
Un clébard qu'a un beau petit manteau
Vient renifler le clodo
Puis il se tire
Vers le bar
Sifflé par son papa
Qui aime les bêtes mais pas
Pas les clochards

Le clochard
Sur sa bouche de métro
Ne gène pas les badauds
Qui tourbillonnent
Et sans voir
Les femmes en robe du soir
Et les hommes dans le bar
Qui réveillonnent
Le clochard
D'un œil indifférent
Regarde les agents qui le harponnent
Pour avoir la veille du jour de l'an
Volé quelques croissants
Chez un bon commerçant
Qui trouve que vraiment
On fait trop de sentiments
Avec ces salopards
De clochards.",Le Clochard

Musique de Henri Salvador

Qu'est ce qu'on est allé faire à Veunise
Ça c'est vraiment des idées à toi
Qu'est ce qu'on est allé faire à Veunise
Qu'est ce qu'on est allé foute là bas
Y a même pas de rues dans ton Veunise
Y'a que de la flotte et des villas
Et des gondoles comme c'est qu'ils disent
En fait de gondoles on se marre pas

Il n'y a que des ponts et des églises
Le pont de ceci, le pont de cela
Tous ces cailloux ça me fout la cerise
Et les églises moi j'y vais pas
Quant à la bouffe et à la bibine
Vaut mieux crois-moi qu'on en cause pas
Y'a des tas de mecs aux mandolines
Qui braillent des trucs qu'on comprend pas

Si tu veux retourner à Veunise
Ben, le prochain coup t'iras sans moi
Pendant ce temps-là veux-tu que je te dise
Je préfère bronzer à Courbevoie.",Veunise
Henri Salvador,"CHAGRIN D’AMOUR





Mon Dieu que ça fait mal un chagrin d'amour 
Mon Dieu que ça fait mal un chagrin d'amour 
Si tu savais le mal que ça fait
Je crois bien que tu regretterais
Celui que tu m'as fait quand tu m'as quitté

Mon Dieu que ça fait mal un chagrin d'amour 
Quand on le porte en soi la nuit et le jour
Que l'on n'a plus envie de la vie
Que l'on se sent tout seul, tout petit
Et qu'il faut malgré tout continuer à vivre

Oh, tu ne peux savoir
Ce que c'est que d'attendre des heures
Pour t'apercevoir
Et de te voir sourire
Au bras de celui qui m'a volé ta vie

Mon Dieu que ça fait mal un chagrin d'amour 
Ça vous ronge la nuit, ça vous brûle le jour
On a beau être un homme et se dire
Que tout finira bien par finir
On a le cœur blessé prêt à en mourir

Mon Dieu que ça fait mal un chagrin d'amour 
On n'en voit pas la fin ça dure toujours
On a beau s'étourdir, voyager
Moi j'ai tout essayé, tout tenté
Pour oublier ton nom et ton souvenir

Mais tu es là toujours
Tu es là dans mon cœur, dans ma vie
Et je n'y peux rien
Oui tu es là toujours
Ni le temps ni personne n'y peuvent rien

Mon Dieu que ça fait mal un chagrin d'amour",Un Chagrin d'Amour
Henri Salvador,"Le destin
Qui te fit un beau matin,
Croiser ma route,
Le désirait sans doute
Mais depuis,
Tout au long des jours et des nuits
De toi je doute
Et mon rêve s'enfuit.
Lorsque tu viens te blottir
Aux creux de mes bras,
Tes yeux ne peuvent mentir,
Mais je n'y crois pas,
Sur mon souci
Tu ris tout bas,
Mais chéri, Ne m'en veux pas ...

{Refrain:}
Mon coeur est jaloux malgré moi
Jaloux d'un regard vers un autre,
D'un mot qui soudain fait trembler ta voix
Jaloux d'un frisson qui glisse en tes doigts ...
Mais c'est ce danger j'en ai peur,
Qui nous lie si bien l'un à l'autre,
Le jour, mon espoir
Tu l'emportes avec toi,
Et mon coeur est jaloux malgré moi !

Je sais bien,
Tu profiteras demain,
Pour ta défense,
De cette confidence,
A ce jeu,
Ton coeur est le plus fort des deux
Le mien d'avance
Fait tout ce que tu veux !
Mais de ce goût que tu as
De me voir souffrir,
Mon coeur un jour parviendra
Peut-être à guérir,
Si c'était vrai,
Qui sait pourtant,
S'il pourrait
T'aimer autant !

{au Refrain}

Mon coeur est jaloux malgré moi
Jaloux d'un regard vers un autre,
D'un mot qui soudain fait trembler ta voix
Jaloux d'un frisson qui glisse en tes doigts ...

Qui courent sans cesse après le travail
Moi le travail me court après
Il n'est pas près de m'rattraper.

Maint'nant dans le plus p'tit village
Les gens travaillent comme des sauvages
Pour se payer tout le confort
Quand ils l'ont, eh bien, ils sont morts.

Homm’s d'affaires et meneurs de foule
Travaill’nt à en perdre la boule
Et meur’nt d'une maladie d’cœur
C'est très rare chez les pétanqueurs !",Le Travail C'est la Santé
Henri Salvador,"C'était hier
Ce matin-là
C'était hier
C'est loin déjà
C'était hier
Il y a longtemps
Et tu te perds
Dans la nuit des temps

Peu m'importe de savoir où tu es
Puisque tu ne reviendras plus jamais
Simplement, pour que mon coeur ait moins froid
Simplement, je te revois

Tout comme hier
Ce matin-là
C'était hier
Et c'est loin déjà
Il a brillé
Ce vieux soleil
Pour saluer
Notre réveil

Le beau temps aura quitté l'horizon
Il pleuvra, ce sera triste à mourir
Et la neige couvrira la maison
Les lilas pourront fleurir

Tout comme hier
Je serai là
Tout comme hier
Et c'est loin déjà

Henri Salvador,"Dans mon île
Ah comme on est bien
Dans mon île
On n'fait jamais rien
On se dore au soleil
Qui nous caresse
Et l'on paresse
Sans songer à demain
Dans mon île
Ah comme il fait doux
Bien tranquille
Près de ma doudou
Sous les grands cocotiers qui se balancent
En silence, nous rêvons de nous.

Dans mon île
Un parfum d'amour
Se faufile
Dès la fin du jour
Elle accourt me tendant ses bras dociles
Douce et fragile
Dans ses plus beaux atours
Ses yeux brillent
Et ses cheveux bruns
S'éparpillent
Sur le sable fin
Et nous jouons au jeu d'Adam et Eve
Jeu facile
Qu'ils nous ont appris
Car mon île c'est le Paradis",Dans Mon Île
Henri Salvador,"Lorsque vous aurez repris
La route de Paris
A la fin de vos vacances, 
Je resterai seul avec mon rêve
Et ma romance, 
Dans le village où je vis, 
Seul dans ce bistrot où nous passions
Toutes les nuits, 
Seul avec cet air de danse.

Vous, vous oublierez ce souvenir sans importance
Aux cocktails de vos amis.
J\'ai passé quatre semaines
Comme un gosse ensorcelé, 
Mais d\'ici l\'année prochaine, 
Mon amour va s\'envoler.
Oh ! Que je déteste maintenant
Rentrer chez moi
Et pourtant, mon amie blonde, 
Ma chambre était bien
La plus jolie chambre
Du monde
Quand vous ouvriez vos bras.

Dans le feu qui meurt, 
Sous le regard froid
De l\'hiver, 
Je revois votre visage
Mais il disparaît
Comme le sable de la plage
Sous l\'écume de la mer.",La Fin des Vacances

Henri Salvador,"Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun;
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run;
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above;
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now, parched by the sun;
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run;
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart;
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me,
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see.

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return.
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam.
You can't be happy until you bring it home,
Home to the greenfields and me once again.",Verte Campange (Greenfields)

Henri Salvador,"Des yeux à damner tous le saints
Des seins à vous crever les yeux
Des hanches à vous forcer la main
Des mains à vous ouvrir les cieux

C'est Samothrace sans ses ailes
C'est la Vénus avec des bras

Aurait moulé à Tanagra

Elle est vraiment digne du Louvre
Par sa perfection
Mais voilà, il faut pas qu'elle l'ouvre
Car bon dieu qu'elle est con !

Un peu plus touché chaque jour
Par ses dons cent fois répétés
Pour la cuisine et pour l'amour
Et par sa radieuse beauté

J'ai fini par me laisser faire
Malgré son tout petit esprit

Très doucement elle m'a dit :

Je me crois digne de ta flamme
Et de porter ton nom
Car pour m'avoir choisi pour femme
Faut vraiment qu'tu sois con !",Qu'elle Est Con
Henri Salvador,"I've looked all around this
Big old world and found that
All I really want is love

Nothing can compare
This world I've had my share of
All I really want is love

In this life of chasing dreams
Such strife in seeking schemes
Designed for happiness

Now I finally realized
Deep underneath my lies
All I really want is love.

I've had twice my share
From fortune to despair now
All I really want is love

Nothing satisfies this
World won't compromise me
All I really want is love

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [#]
Henri Salvador,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

And now I sit and wonder night and day

Henri Salvador,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Pour pouvoir leur garnir la panse
De chocolat fumant

Eh! Mama! Qu'est-ce que tu fais chauffer là?
Ton corsage a un tel volume
Qu'on en est étonné
Mais on dort comme dans la plume
Le nez dans tes nénés!

Quelques fois, nous sommes trois ou quatre
A venir dîner chez Mama
Et il faut la voir se débattre
Pour contenter ce monde-là

Et s'asseyent sur vos genoux
Ça fait un petit intermède
Et chacun rit beaucoup

Grand festival de cinéma
Avec ses stars, son casino et son soleil
Ses défilés de mode à nul autre pareil
Tennis et golf et polo
Son Midem au bord de l’eau
Et sa pétanque sur la place de l’Etang
Cannes vraiment c’est étonnant
Tout l’temps
Avec sa vieille ville
Et son Suquet tranquille
Loin des palaces et près du port
C’est étonnant c’est Cannes
Mélange excitant
D’anis et de safran
Ses galas, son ambiance
De gaieté, d’élégance
Et l’accent de ses habitants
Les îles de Lérins
Et le masque de fer
Dont on n’a jamais vraiment percé le mystère
Véritable paradis
Où est presque tout est permis
Où tout est fait pour vous donner d’ la joie
Cannes vraiment c’est étonnant
Tout l’temps.",C'est Étonnant C'est Cannes
Henri Salvador,"Ça fait déjà longtemps
Que j'ai pris mes distances
Le parti d'en sourire
Plutôt que la souffrance

J'ai eu ma part de pire
J'ai eu ma part de chance
J'étais juste là pour vous dire
Ça n'a pas d'importance
Tout ça c'était pour rire
Ça n'a pas d'importance
C'est vrai j'ai pris mon temps
Tout dans la nonchalance

Henri Salvador,"Débutant tout petit
J’ai connu des confrères

De longues plages et plus de macadam
Des bateaux bleus sous le pont Notre Dame

Henri Salvador,"Tant de temps
Au cadran de l'absence
Tant de temps
Déluge de silence
Tout à coup
La nuit tombe sur nous

Tant de temps
Comme une marée noire
Qui s'étend
Sur l'eau de ma mémoire
Sous la proue
D'un amour qui s'échoue

Oh, ma vie
Pourquoi suis-je tombé de haut
Sur le banc des gens normaux
Dans mes mains
Y'a plus rien
Que du pain pour les oiseaux

Tant de temps
À respirer tes lettres
Ces instants
Qui ne peuvent pas renaître
Dans nos yeux
Qui ne croient plus en nous deux

Tant de temps
Qui me ronge les ongles
Jusqu'au sang
À blanchir ton ombre
J'ai si peur
Des fantômes du bonheur

Toutes ces nuits
À survivre loin de toi
Dans le vide de tes bras
Accroché à l'amour
Sous l'avalanche des jours

Découvrant sous mon oreiller
Un ancien petit reve oublié

S’emplit avec volupté
De murmures
Et d’odeur de café
Puis je m’habille tout en sifflotant
Un petit air coquin
Il y a comme un parfum de printemps
Ce matin
Dehors, le ciel en costume bleu
Me fait les doux yeux
Et le soleil semble faire la fete
Au bon Dieu, au bon Dieu
Un ruisseau qui s’étire

Flirtant avec les roseaux
Croise un pont qui se mire
Dans ses eaux
En chantant, des alouettes
Grimpent jusqu’au firmament
Et les blés plient leur tete dans le vent
Sur son vélo, une jolie fille
Passe et me sourit
Comme un cadeau qui vient m’offrir
La vie
Et quand le soir, un ciel étoilé
Vient faire sa cour
Je garde en moi
Cette belle journée
Pour toujours, pour toujours
Mon Dieu, quelle belle journée",Une Belle Journée
Henri Smith,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

And every time your lips meet mine

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all

And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful

Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Just me for you and you for me, alone!

No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.

Help me get my feet back on the gound.

If you go down in the woods today, you'd better go in disguise
For every bear that ever there was will gather there for certain
Because today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic

Every teddy bear who's been good is sure of a treat today
There's lots of marvellous things to eat and wonderful games to play
Beneath the trees where nobody sees they'll hide and seek as long as they please

That's the way the teddy bears have their picnic

Picnic time for teddy bears
The little teddy bears are having a lovely time today
Watch them, catch them unawares and see them picnic on their holiday

See them gaily gad about
They love to play and shout
They never have any cares
At six o'clock their mummies and daddies will take them back home to bed
Because they're tired little teddy bears

If you go down in the woods today, you better not go alone
It's lovely down in the woods today, but safer to stay at home

Henry Hall,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.

You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.

You're stratosphere.

Henry Jerome,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Henry Jerome,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel
Henry Johnson,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Henry Johnson,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

I come into this life
The son of a woman
And a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor
And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more

A different kind of poverty now upsets my soul
Night after sleepless night
I walk the floor and I want to know
Why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?

Morning comes to sunrise
And I'm driven to my bed
I see that it is empty
And there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast
I grow weary of the torment
Can there be no peace?
And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease.",4 + 20

Henry Mancini,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland
Henry Mancini,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars
Henry Mancini,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings
Henry Mancini,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Henry Mancini,"Our waltz is music fashioned in heaven,
Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

And our love was their inspiration!

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles

For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,

Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Henry Mancini,"Thank heaven for little girls
for little girls get bigger every day

Thank heaven for little girls
they grow up in the most delightful way

Those little eyes so helpless and appealing
one day will flash and send you crashin' thru the ceilin'

Thank heaven for little girls
thank heaven for them all,
no matter where no matter who
for without them, what would little boys do?

Thank heaven, thank heaven

Henry Mancini,"When we played our charade
We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will
Best on the bill
Charade",Charade
Henry Mancini,"I'm in Dreamsville, holding you
A dreamy view, just we two alone
If love in Dreamsville, time is new
We're here to love and we do

We can see the rest of the world
Below us from our pink cloud

There's no boundary to this magic land
As we go exploring hand in hand
In dreamy Dreamsville
Far away and here we love
Here we stay

There's no boundary to this magic land
As we go exploring hand in hand
In dreamy Dreamsville
Far away and here we love
Here we stay",Dreamsville
Henry Mancini,"Meglio stasera
Baby go go go
or as we natives say
""Fa subito!""
If you're ever gonna kiss me
it had better be tonight
while the mandolins are playing
and stars are bright
If you've anything to tell me
it had better be tonight
or somebody else may tell me
and whisper the words just right
Meglio stasera
Baby go go go
or as we natives say
""Fa subito!""
For this poor Americano
who knows little of your speech
be a nice Italiano
and start to teach
Show me how in old Milano
Lovers hold each other tight
but I want you sweet paesano
it had better be tonight

Baby go go go
or as we natives say

Henry Mancini,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind
Henry Mancini,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine",The Best Is Yet to Come
Henry Mancini," The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play 
Through a meadow land toward a closing door 
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before 

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories 
Of the golden smile that introduced me to 
The days of wine and roses and you 

(The lonely night discloses) just a passing breeze filled with memories 
Of the golden smile that introduced me to 
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo ",Experiment in Terror
Henry Mancini,"They say there's a tree in the forest
A tree that will give you a sign
Come along with me to the Sweetheart Tree
Come and carve your name next to mine

They say if you kiss the right sweetheart
The one you've been waiting for
Big blossoms of white will burst into sight
And your love will be true evermore",The Sweetheart Tree
Henry Mancini,"This time we almost made the pieces fit
Didn't we?
This time we almost made some sense of it
Didn't we?
This time I had the answer, right here in my hand
Then I touched it and it had turned to sand

This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made it, made it to the moon 
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made our poem rhyme
This time we almost made that long hard climb
Didn't we almost make it?
Didn't we almost make it?
Didn't we almost make it this time?",Didn't We
Henry Mancini,"Some boys kiss me
Some boys hug me
I think they're ok
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys slow dance

If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day

And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well if you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been

Henry Mancini,"It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl!
But all the while you hear the creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl

This is the end of your life

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

Henry Mancini,"Darling Lili, is an angel from Heaven
Come to see us a little while
Stage door Johnnies wait for her
Our voice encore her
They just adore her style

Darling Lili, doesn't dream of the heart
She keeps on breaking with just a smile
But you'd better just forget her
Toddle off and let her be
Leave that darling, darling Lili, to me

My dear heart, it seems like a year since you've been out of my sight

And dear heart, I want you to know
I'll leave your arms never more

Henry Mancini,"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain

Henry Mancini,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Henry Mancini,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",The Way We Were [From The Way We Were]
Henry Mancini,"Nothing to lose
If we are wise
We're not expecting rainbow-colored skies
Not right away

Nothing to lose
It might be fun
No talk of spending lifetimes in the sun
Although we may

Both you and I have seen what time can do
We'll only hurt ourselves if we build dreams that don't come true

What can we lose
We know the score
Let's wait before we talk of evermore
One day we may

Nothing to lose
But much to gain if love decides to stay

[repeat the last three sections]

Nothing to lose
",Nothing to Lose
Henry Mancini,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply as time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings, as time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by",As Time Goes By
Henry Mancini,"Crazy world
Full of crazy contradictions, like a child.
First you drive me wild, and then you win my heart
With your wicked art.
One minute tender, gentle, then temperamental as a summer storm.
Just when I believe your heart's getting warmer, you're cold, and you're cruel.
And I like a fool, try to cope, try to hang on, to hope.

Crazy world
Every day the same old roller coaster ride.
But I've got my pride, I won't give in.
Even though I know I'll never win.
Oh, how I love this crazy world.",Crazy World
Henry Mancini,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.
