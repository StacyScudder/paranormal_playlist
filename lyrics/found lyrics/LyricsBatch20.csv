Cibo Matto,"Why can't we dance in the same groove every day?
My step starts from 6 to 1, from 6 to 1, you make fun of my honesty
But I think consciousness is the same in space... in space...

I'm living in the second world, I'm watching, watching you from the second world
Don't complain about it, baby, I can not be perfect for you
Still learning every Sunday, I just spend. I just spend...every Sunday... every","Sunday, Pt. 2"
Cibo Matto,"Working for vacation
Walking for meditation
Watching television for as long as I want
People got science but makes no sense,
Still can't do anything for cutting out violence
When I think of something, it goes out to space
Then it comes back (to me) in another shape
We know we are not apes,
But we could make sweet seedless grapes

Feeling wrong 'cause the days are too long,
Counting heartbeats 72 in a minute
Feeling wrong 'cause the days are too long,
Counting heartbeats 72 in a minute

I need to talk to an ancient Egyptian to know the transcription
To read the prescription for the friction we've got
Or the options we'll have maybe God only knows",Working for Vacation
Cibo Matto,"The bomb in my heart is beating me a be note
Maybe my ear dirt is cheating on me, yo
Missin' you on a Sunday morning

Need somethin' new, it's Sunday morning
But nothing helps me
I'm just waiting for the milkman to come

I can't find it, I can't find it
I can't find it, I can't find it
I can't find it, I can't find it
I can't find it, I can't find it

Why do I feel so lonely?
I don't know how to compromise
You are my one and only
What can I find 'til the moon rises?

Why do I feel so lonely?
I don't know how to compromise
You are my one and only
What can I find 'til the moon rises?

I feel dizzy, you're so damn sleazy
I know you'll say, ""I was busy""
Baby, take me out, it's been rained out
I run to the bank to get my cash

And to check our savings of love out
But it's closed on Sunday

What can I say? I feel blue
The rain starts soaking my shoes
We are losing glue, I can't find a clue

I'm knocking on the door
Someone busy on the floor
Then I know the score
I can't take it no more

Knicks winnin' can't even make me high
Cuttin' coupons for nothing makes me sigh
Knicks winnin' can't even make me high
Cuttin' coupons for nothing makes me sigh

Knicks winnin' can't even make me high
Cuttin' coupons for nothing makes me sigh
Knicks winnin' can't even make me high
Cuttin' coupons for nothing makes me sigh

Why do I feel so lonely?
I don't know how to compromise
You are my one and only
What can I find 'til the moon rises?

Why do I feel so lonely?
I don't know how to compromise
You are my one and only
What can I find 'til the moon rises?

Cibo Matto,"If I turn to the right at the corner
I may find love within a short block

Which way should I go now? 
Should I keep on going this way?
Tell me now
'Cause I can't be in the back seat of love anymore

When I turn to the right at the corner
I may see the rough road you've been down
When I turn to the left at the corner
I might see all the stones you have thrown

I might feel alone with a silence 
Does the map that you have show my home?

Which way should I go now? Should I keep on going this way

Cibo Matto,"I can take your pain away if you tear down your fortress of memory
I can take your pain away, you don't always need to be strong
I can take your pain away, I know we wear different shoes
I can take your pain away, barefoot we will tear the truth

You are the king of silence, you don't need one word to talk to me
All I know is we have sympathy
Close your eyes and lean your head on me

I can take your pain away if you find a remedy in me
I can take your pain away, you can take as much as you want from me
I can take your pain away, we have a distance between us
I can take your pain away, every time we can find the clue",King of Silence [Dan the Automator Remix][#]
Cicada,"Nothing lasts forever
Of that I'm sure
Now you've made an offer
I'll take some more
Young loving may be
Oh so mean
Will I still survive
The same old scene?
In our lighter moments
Precious few
It's all that heavy weather
We're going through
When I turn the corner
I can't believe
It's still the same old movie
That's haunting me
Young loving may be
Oh so mean
Trying to revive
The same old scene
Young loving may be
So extreme
Maybe we should try
The same old scene

Cicada Omega,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly

Ciccone Youth,"The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind, is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breath
Another kiss, is all you need
You'd like to think that you're immune
To stare, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get it
You're gonna have to face it you're addicted to love

You're throat is tight, you can't breath
Running at, a different speed
You're heart beats, double time
Another kiss, and you'll be mine
A one track mind, you can't be saved
Oblivion, is all you crave
Is there a song, for you
You don't mind, if you do
You got to think that you're immune
To stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get it, noooo
You're gonna have to face it you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Your heart sweats, your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine
You got to think that you're immune

Ciccone Youth,"Go burn me up 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't reach my desire
Do you know that I'm burnin' up for your lovin'
You ain't convinced that that is nothing

And I presume the imposition
You know I'm alive and there's
So mean in my heart, it won't die
I'm burnin' up

I'm burnin' up

You're always closing the door
I think that that only makes me want you more
Damned I, too hard for you lovin'
You aren't convinced that that is nothing

Justify my wanting you
Tell me what you want me to do?
I'm not blind, and I know
That you're going to want me but you can't let go

I'm burnin' up
I'm burnin' up
I'm burnin' up

Do you want to sit down with me?
Would you please
I ain't the same see I got no shame
I'm on fire, fire

Come on, let go

Do you want to sit down with me?
Would you please
I ain't the same see I got no shame

We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Eu você em qualquer lugar
Dizendo ""aonde você for eu vou""
E quando eu perguntei
Ouvi você dizer
Que eu era tudo o que você sempre quis
Mesmo triste eu tava feliz
E acabei acreditando em ilusões
Eu nem pensava em ter
Que esquecer você
Agora vem você dizer
""Amor, eu errei com você
E só assim pude entender
Que o grande mal que eu fiz
Foi a mim mesmo""

What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give

Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,

What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in.

While you're in the world

I sat on the roof and
Kicked of the moss
Well a few of the verses
Well they've got me
Quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that
Keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten
If they're green
Or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes
I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that is done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

There's a moon above Cassis
There's a menu in my room that can't be read
I am burned, broke and legless on pastis
And tonight you're all I really miss or need
There's a band down the street 
Singing high and sweet
But I can't make out a word they say
""Tout le monde de besoin d'amour""

Won't you come to me, come to me
Won't you come to me

There's a map inside my pocket,
But I don't know where I'll go
I'm pulled in all directions by the moon
I am lost, free, exhausted and alive
And you been on my mind all afternoon
But the lines are always blocked 
And the operators talk
But I can't make out a word they say

Somewhere I could hide my soul 
There I hoped to find a way to ease my mind 
Couldn't face the gloom tomorrow

Thinking doesn't help but seems 
I crept to bed and cried myself to sleep once more 
Then I had the wildest dream 

(Street called Hope) in a town named Freedom 
Where each clock is pointed to the hour of love 
Upon a street called Hope at the house of Welcome 
That's where she opened the door of love 

When I awoke the following day 
Every doubt had left my mind 
My dream it taught me what the prophets say 
Those who seek will always find 

I ran down the stair and out in to the street 
Looking for the nearest phone 
We both said sorry and decided to meet 
To find ourselves a happy home

She was still fast asleep
A dream and a song away
I got on the plane to L.A.

I know it's heartbreaking
The time that I'm taking
The tears that you're crying
I know that you're dying

?Cause I'm going away
And you know I can't take you with me
And time ain't gonna stop today

Down on my bed and you're not there
I wonder if you're somewhere else

Tied me up and you cut me loose

Girl, you know how to light it up
When you're walking the wire
The flame's getting higher and higher

?Cause every time I try my best

A shot in the dark, took a chance
And kept on waiting for you

Another day gone and wasted
The fear of being alone
I can't take it no more

Maybe it's time that we start looking
For something different
It seems you and I have grown apart

Let it drift away if the love is gone
You gotta do what you can and just move on
Let it drift away, don't you wait too long
You gotta do what you can to just move on
When the love is gone, just move on

Step by step, tired of chasing
Over and over in circles
As my heart's racing from this

You crossed the line, no hesitating
Wearing me out like a song
That keeps playing and playing

We all want to live a story
With a happy ending
But luck ran out on you and I

Let it drift away if the love is gone
You gotta do what you can and just move on
Let it drift away, don't you wait too long
You gotta do what you can to just move on
When the love is gone, just move on

You don't know how it feels
To walk away and leave it
It hurts to lose a love that's real

Let it drift away if the love is gone
You gotta do what you can and just move on
Let it drift away, don't you wait too long

They said you're only gettin' older
But how was I to know then
That they'd be cryin' on my shoulder

Put your money in a big house
Get yourself a pretty wife

When she connects you with a knife

Somebody get the doctor
I'm feelin' pretty poor
Somebody get the stretcher
Before I hit the floor

Somebody save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me
Save me

Everybody's got opinions
But nobody's got the answers
And that shit you ate for breakfast
Well it'll only give you cancer

We're runnin' in a circle
Runnin' to the morning light
And if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night

Somebody get the doctor
I think i'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
Because i ain't got the cash

Farther along we'll understand it all

Were headed for a fall
But those who listened hard enough
Could hear the summer call

Now I was growing up through all of this
My first beer and love and my first kiss
You never learn the things in school
You learn by living and going through
You taught me to be myself
How can I thank you

Answers to the questions that nobody knew
Used to be a time when I had some time
But when I had the time, I didn't know what to do

Wasted all those years never gettin? any younger
Times kept a changin? but I still got the hunger
Only trouble is the walls are closing in
Sometimes I want to give it all away

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

Maybe I?ll head down south to New Orleans
Wouldn't have no taxes ?cause I wouldn't have no means
Lookin' for a Genie that could fill my dreams
But dreams become reality and real ain't what it seems to be

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

Sick for the cure on this roller coaster ride
It can take you real low and it can get you real high
Just passin? time
But time ain't on our side
Ah, guitar

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

I just wanna be free

My lady's on the fly and she's never coming back

And now I'll think I'll make a new start

Cinderella,"I can't tell ya baby what went wrong
I can't make you feel what you felt so long ago
I'll let it show
I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all that's left are the words
I can't let go
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really want to go

[Chorus]
Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long

I can't feel the things that cause you pain
I can't clear my heart of your love it falls like rain
Ain't the same
I hear you calling far away
Tearing through my soul I just can't take another day
Who's to blame
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time let me know
If you really wanna go

Do you wanna see me beggin' baby
Can't you give me just one more day
Can't you see my heart's been draggin' lately

Cinderella,"When I was a young boy
They said you're only gettin' older
But how was I to know then
That they'd be cryin' on my shoulder
Put your money in a big house
Get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
When she connects you with a knife

Somebody get the doctor
I'm feelin' pretty poor
Somebody get the stretcher
Before I hit the floor

Somebody save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me
Save me

Everybody's got opinions
But nobody's got the answers
And that shit you ate for breakfast
Well it'll only give you cancer

We're runnin' in a circle
Runnin' to the morning light
And if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night

Somebody get the doctor
I think I'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
Because I ain't got the cash

I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me

I met this girl around quarter to ten
We made it once, she said ""make me again""

In the mornin' we were still goin' strong

Now let me tell ya, it sure feels good
First time I saw that girl I knew it would
Now let me tell ya, it sure felt right

Shake me, shake it, don't break it baby
Shake me, all night, she said
All night long
All night long baby

Screamed and scratched and rolled out of the bed
I never really got her out of my head
And now and then she makes those social calls
Gives me a squeeze, gets me kickin' the walls

Now let me tell ya, it still feels tight
And we were shakin' after every bite
I feel her comin' in the middle of the night
Screamin' higher

Cindi Scheffler,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow
Cindy & Bert,"Jeden Sonntag kamen sie herüber,
Unsre Musikanten aus Athen.
Jeden Sonntag waren sie uns lieber
Und das können nur wir zwei verstehen.
Immer wieder Sonntags kommt die Erinnerung,
Ich hör die Bouzuki spielen.
Grade so wie in der Sonntag Nacht,
Als das Glück uns zwei nach Haus gebracht.
Immer wieder Sonntags kommt die Erinnerung
Und da sind dieselben Lieder,
Die wir hörten in der Sonntag Nacht,
Als do mir das Glück gebracht.
Jede Sonntag Nacht war voller Lieder,
Mit den Musikanten aus Athen.
Und wir beide werden bald schon wieder,

Cindy Alexander,"Welcome to my open house
Please ignore the mess around
I've been meaning to clean it up for quite sometime
Built on rock
I'm just run down
A fixer upper
I just need some sound advise from someone with an open mind
To think creatively of all the possibilities 

See the smile of Mona Lisa
Think the leaning Tower of Pisa
Tilt your head and see the way it stands up tall
Find the beauty in graffiti
The right of Spring by I. Stravinsky
Close your eyes and listen to the beauty of it all
Could you be the one to see
The Masterpiece in me. 

Lights are broken in the hall
A crack runs down my bedroom wall
But character is priceless now or so they say
It suddenly occurs to me while polishing my personality
To leave some roughness there around the edge
Some things don't fit perfectly
That's just called Reality 

See the smile of Mona Lisa
Think the leaning Tower of Pisa
Tilt your head and see the way it stands up tall
Find the beauty in graffiti

Close your eyes and listen to the beauty of it all
Could you be the one to see
The Masterpiece in me.

The perfect harmony
To my Unfinished Symphony

Cindy Alexander,"The space between our words
The heat before we touch
The breath that we hold
So that we don't say too much

The beating of our hearts
The parting of our lips
And the eyes that try to turn away
That have looked so long for this

[Chorus]
It's only love
It's everything we fear
Everything we need
The reason to lose faith
And the reason to believe
It's only everything that matters
Everything worth dreaming of
It's just you and me
And it's only love

Castles made of sand
That crumbled at our feet
The sound of goodbye
Echoes in our memory

Caught up in the past
Tangled in the chains
And we try to fight the hunger
That only love explains

Love Me
Baby rest your mind
Feel the earth spin
Against space and time
It's just you and me
And what's in between.

Cindy Alexander,"I am your typical Aquarius
With Libra rising so you don't have to ask
And if you can't find that perfect line
Well then, you can throw me a pass
Yeah

Smash me
Turn it up and blast me
If you wanna have me
Give it some gas and
Crash Me
With all you got or pass me
If you wanna have me
Then you better blow my mind

Stop burning a hole with your stare
Come on, take a chance and touch me there
I don't mind a little bit of pressure
'cause it can take some tension for two to get together

I fall
I fall...just to feel alive

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Cindy Cuevas,"Fue en un pueblo con mar
Una noche después de un concierto
Tú reinabas detrás
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto
""Cántame una canción
Al oído y te pongo un cubata""
""Con una condición
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata""
Loco por conocer

Los secretos de su dormitorio
Esa noche canté
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tú saliste a cerrar
Yo me dije

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""
Luego todo pasó
De repente, su dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Y Nos Dieron Las Diez

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

In the morning and started to laugh

Cindy McLeod,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?
Cindy McLeod,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

Cindy McLeod,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Cindy McLeod,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Cindy Morgan,"There's nothing like the warmth of a summer afternoon
Waking to the sunlight, being cradled by the moon
Catching fireflies at night, building castles in the sand
Kissing mama's face goodnight and holding daddy's hand
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

Running barefoot through the grass, a little hide and go seek
Being so in love that you can hardly eat
Dancing in the dark when there's no one else around
Being bundled 'neath the covers, watching snow fall to the ground
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

So many things I thought would bring me happiness
Some dreams that are realities today
Such an irony the things that mean the most to me
Are the memories that I've made along the way

So if there's anything I've learned from this journey I am on
Simple truths will keep you going, simple love will keep you strong
'Cause there are questions without answers and flames that never die
And heartaches we go through are often blessings in disguise
So thank you, Lord, oh thank you, Lord
And yeah, how could I ask for more? Oh",How Could I Ask for More
Cindy Morgan,"I danced with another, but the melody fade
I took it for granted but I can't take it no more
I guess nobody's perfect
We're always last to admit that we should blame ourselves

So love is lost, don't we know our hearts anymore
Now tell me, if this life's a game of give and take
Why are we taking so much, we've been taking so much
We gotta learn how to give, it's time to let it begin

Let it be love, let it be true
Cause love will be all that we remember
Open up our arms to each other
Oh, let it be love
Don't you know the heart and soul are what matter

Let it be love
Cause love will be all that lasts forever
Open up our hearts to each other
Oh and let it be love

I stand with a stranger, wond'ring what I'm afraid of
I feel like a prisoner, holding the key to the door
Why run from each other
We've lead ourselves to believe that no one really cares

So on we go, I wonder what we're leaving behind
Now tell me what's a broken world supposed to do
When we've been hurting so much, we've been hurting so much
We've got to find love in Him, so won't you let it begin

I believe In love again

Cindy Morgan,"The mountains are steep and the valley's low
And already I'm weary but I have so far to go
Oh, and sorrow holds my hand and suffering sings me songs
But when I close my eyes I know to whom I belong
And who makes me strong

And I will be free, I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free, free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back 'cause he awaits for me
Oh, I will be free

A shepherd to lead us through the land of woes
Though many battles I have lost so many rivers yet to cross
But my eyes behold the Son who bore my loss and who paid the cost

I will be free, I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free, oh, free to drink from the living fountain

And then the hard times begin to wash away
And sun shines and brings a new light where we can
Recline in the sweet, sweet days of grace

Deep inside the world fear treads
And hearts cry out loud
Shadows shifting 'round
And we fight

Dancing with out doubt
But darkness runs from the light
And mercy comes and shines
In His perfect time, and

And sun shines and brings a new light where we can

That You're never far away
Your steps, the place we long to be

No way to right all the wrongs
Don't have to know all the words
'Cause You are the song, and

And sun shines and brings a new light where we can

Under the water fall, catching all our pain
Under His gaze of grace

Of a love we had before
Blinded by sanity
What's behind the crimson door?

What happened to my eyes
Incapable of seeing signs
There's just one miracle
That's left of this love

After the rain
I still see heaven crying
After the rain
I still feel no relief
Cause everything we used to be
And used to feel
It all becomes so frightening real
After the rain

Rainbow skies turned to grey
Ever since we lost our smile
Innocence gone astray
Since the day we said goodbye

What happened to our dreams
Aborted in this dried out stream
There's just one miracle
That's left of this love

After the rain
I still see heaven crying

I still feel no relief
Cause everything we used to be
And used to feel

Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on

Using microphones set it off like the fuse in the Cipher zone
As I'm tellin' crews be gellin'
Rhymes blow your outter skeleton if your styles relevant
You know the flavor I gets deep like the grave
Headcracks I gave when tomahawk like a Brave
Now I'm paid in the trade like Special Ed Got It Made
Some conquer slave along the way sprayed like Raid
In 92 I spent my days in the YMCA
Freestyling while I cut the cross fade like a blade 
Stayed off the stage writting page after page
Now I blast like a gauge twisting raps like braids
Laid stunts like I forgot, blunts got me all high
Hittin' stick after stick as I kick back
Acting like you run shit, rappin' all that dumb shit
You ain't the first one to brag about your fuckin' guns kid

I bust rough cuts and never trust promoters at a show
They stack doe and try to stake me off the cash flow

Then step collect my props and be out with the skins or punany

Hit the cheeba sip a liter of Tequila

Circus Maximus,"I remember you told me once
What could be the answer to it all
The answer to my soul
I believed in love not magic, needed some time
To figure out what to do with this
To my heart that is (I was so alone)

Why can't you see it?
I need some time alone
Every moment my heart beat
I remember how it used to be

Can you forgive how I used to be?
Even all the stars remain through lonely nights
(They keep shining)
I believed in love
Through the midnight-sun we rolled
Even if the stars remain I know that this won't last forever
(This won't last forever)

We will make it through the night
When you feel alive, and there's nothing you can do
When you can't explain, is there a reason why I'm living?
When you feel alive, and there's nothing you can do
Now I keep on searching for the path that lies ahead
Is the longest way to go

I can see the sun shine up above
I can see the rainbow that glows
Into the fire we burn
I see it, I can't deny it
The feelings I have deep inside for you

When you feel alive, and there's nothing you can do

You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Sometimes it's hard to believe
That God keeps loving me so much

And gave me a chance
And everyday I gotta thank him for
Where I am

And listen to my song
Please do not grow weary
I'll not detain you long
Concerning some wild cowboys
Who did agree to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo

Well I found myself in Griffin
In eighteen eighty-three
When a well-known famous drover
Come a'walkin' up to me
Sayin' ""How do you do young feller
And how'd you like to go
And spend a summer pleasant
On the trail of the buffalo?""

Well me being out of work right then
To that drover I did say
""This goin' out on the buffalo road
Depends upon your pay
If you pay good wages
Transportation to and fro
Well I think I might go with you
On the range of the buffalo""

Yes I will pay good wages
And transportation too
If you'll agree to work for me
Until the season's through
But if you do grow homesick
And try and run away
You'll starve to death out on the trail
And you'll also lose your pay

Well with all this flatterin' talkin'

Some ten or twelve in number

As we hit the Westward Row
Until we struck ol' Boggy Creek
In old New Mexico

Well, here our pleasures ended
And our troubles all begun
When a lightnin' storm come up on us
And it made the cattle run
We got full of the stickers
From the cactus that did grow
And the outlaws waiting to pick us off
In old New Mexico

Well the working season ended
But the drover would not pay
He said ""You went and drunk too much
You're all in debt to me""
But the cowboys never had heard
Of such a thing as a bankrupt law
So we left the drover's bones to bleach

Cisco Houston,"Jesus Christ was a man
Who traveled through the land
A hard working man and brave
He said to the rich,
""Give your goods to the poor.""
But they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.

Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty little coward called Judas Iscariot
Has laid Jesus Christ in his grave

He went to the preacher,
He went to the sheriff,
Told them all the same;
Sell all of your jewelry
And give it to the Poor,
But they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.

When Jesus came to town,
All the working folks around,
Believed what he did say;
The bankers and the preachers
They nailed him on a cross,
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.

The poor working people,
They followed him around,
They sung and shouted gay;
Cops and the soldiers,
They nailed him in the air,
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.

Well the people held their breath
When they heard about his death,
And everybody wondered why;
It was the landlord
And the soldiers that he hired.
That nailed Jesus Christ in the sky.

This song was written in New York City
Of rich men, preachers and slaves
But if Jesus was to preach
Like he preached in Galillee,
They would lay Jesus Christ in his grave.",Jesus Christ

A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.

It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.

Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Pretty Boy Floyd

Prayed for the moon to give him light

Before he reached the town o
Before he reached the town o 

He ran til he came to a great big bin
Where the ducks and the geese were kept therein
Said, a couple of you are going to grease my chin

Throwed a duck across his back
He didn't mind the quack, quack, quack

Out of the window she cocked her head
Crying, John, John the gray goose is gone

Blew his horn both loud and shrill

There were the little ones, eight, nine, ten
Saying, Daddy, daddy, Better go back again

Cut up the goose with a carving knife

Cisco Houston,"As I set down one evening in a timber town cafe
A six foot-seven waitress, to me these words did say
""I see you are a logger and not a common bum
For no one but a logger stirs his coffee with his thumb

""My lover was a logger, there's none like him today
If you'd sprinkle whisky on it, he'd eat a bale of hay
He never shaved the whiskers from off his horny hide
But he'd pound 'em in with a hammer, then bite 'em off inside

""My lover came to see me one freezing winter day
He held me in a fond embrace that broke three vertebrae
He kissed me when we parted so hard it broke my jaw
And I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw

""I watched my logger lover going through the snow
A-sauntering gaily homeward at forty eight below
The weather tried to freeze him, it tried it's level best
At a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest

""It froze clean down to China, it froze to the stars above
At one thousand degrees below zero it froze my logger love
They tried in vain to thaw him and if you'll believe me, sir
They made him into ax blades to chop the Douglas fir

""That's how I lost my lover and to this caffay I come
And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb
And then I tell my story of my love they could not thaw

Cisco Houston,"Oh, when I was a young boy 
And drove my mother wild,
I met a maiden in the woods 
And she said
""Child, look deep into my green eyes 
And at my autumn hair,
When you're a man you'll never see 
A girl quite as fair"".

Chorus:
Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 
For the rest of your life.

Her eyes were green as grassy pools 
Looking right at me,
And her hair was red and grown with leaves 
Just like an autumn tree
She moved her tiny hands 
And she made a little turn.
She swayed in the wind 
Just like a graceful fern.

Chorus

I swore as she vanished 
That when I was full grown,
I'd have a girl just like her 
To be my very own.
And now I am a man 
And I'd marry if I could
But I can't lose the mem'ry 
Of The Girl In The Wood.

Chorus

I've wished a hundred times 
That she'd never looked at me.
With the first wild beauty 
That only youth can see,
For a man cannot find it 
When he's looking for a wife,
And he'll end up in bachelorhood 
The rest of his life.

If you want to have some fun,
And listen while I relate the tale
Of the Great American Bum.

They sleep in the dirt and they wear a shirt 
That's dirty and full of crumb.

Chorus:
I am a bum, a jolly old bum
And I live like a royal Turk
And I have good luck
And I bum all my chuck
And to heck with the man that works

It's early in the morning 
When the dew is on the ground,
The bum arises from his nest
And gazes all around,
Well goin' east, they're loaded,
and goin' west, sealed tight,
I reckon we'll have to ride
Aboard the fast express tonight.

Chorus:

I beat my way from Frisco
To the rockbound coast of Maine
From Canada to Mexico
And then all the way back again.

Well, I met a man the other day 
That I never met before
And he asked me if I wanted a job
A-shoveling iron ore.
I asked what the wages was
And he said ""Ten cents a ton""
I said ""Oh fella, go scratch your...neck,
I'd rather be on the bum.""

Chorus:

Oh lady would you be kind enough
to give me something to eat?
A piece of bread and butter,
And a tender slice of meat,
Some apple pie and custard
Just to tickle my appetite.

Cisco Houston,"He came to town and he looked around,
And he said, ""This is for me.""
He had a pack on his big strong back,
He was tall as a redwood tree.
Well the girls passed by and he winked his eye;
He said, ""I'm July Jones,
I'm the man for you, I'm six foot two,
All muscle, meat and bones.""

Chorus: 
Great July Jones, Well Great July Jones.
He's got a way they can't resist,
He kisses the girls and they stay kissed.
Great July Jones.

Well he took his pack from his great strong back,
And he said ""You lucky girls.
I'm here to stay for a year and a day,
And I won't be shooting squirrels.
So step up now for a howdy-how,
Get favors while you can,
It's dynamite when I hug you tight,
Cause I'm a natural man.

Chorus

Well, he grabbed a girl with a left hand twirl,
She looked so mighty cute.
But she had fight and used her right
And floored him with a beaut.
Now you can't do that to six foot two,
You're only five foot one,
He jumped a mile but she said with a smile,
""You're a boasting son of a gun.""

Chorus

She stepped right up like a demitasse cup,
And he looked into her eyes,
His heart went bang and her own heart sang,
They stood there in surprise,
Well he scratched his head and he smiled and said,
""Now you're the champ I guess.
And if you're free will you marry me?"",
And five foot one said, ""Yes.""

Cisco Houston,"The other night when I came home,
So drunk I could not see
I got tangled up in the old doormat
Fell flat as I could be
And I had me a little old bottle of rum

And I did have any more and
The cap fell of when I fell down
And I spilled it on the floor

Then a rat come out from his hiding place
And he got that whiskey scent
Well he ran right up and got a little shot 

And back to his hole he went
Right back to his whole he went
Right back to his whole he went

Well he ran right up and got a little shot 
And back to his hole he went
Then the rate come out of his hole once more
Sidled up to the gin on the floor

He was a little bit shy
But he winked one eye
And he got him a little bit more
And he didn't go back to his hole this time
But stayed by the puddle of gin
And he said ""Doggone my pop-eyed soul,
I'm gonna get drunk again!""

And he washed his face with his front feet
And on his hind legs he sat
With a twisted smile and a half-closed eye
Says,""Where's that doggone cat?""
And he didn't go back to his hole
He said, ""Doggone my soul, I'm only a rat
But a doggone cat can't run me back to my hole.""

His little old eyes begin to shine
And he capped up more and more
And it made me glad that I had stumbled
And spilled it on the floor
But soon the puddle of rum was gone
And I didn't have any more gin
And the little old rat was having a time

And the old tom cat come in
Well the cat made a pass
And the rat made a dash
And his boldness faded then
The cat jumped over 
And the rat got sober

And ran back to his hole again.
Ran back to his hole again.

Cisco Houston,"Dobe Bill, he went a-riding 
Through the canyon, in the glow
Of a quiet Sunday morning 
From the town of Angelo
Ridin' easy on that pinto 
That he dearly loved to straddle,
With a six-gun and sombrero 
That was wider than his saddle
And he's hummin' as he's goin' 
Of a simple little song
That's a-boomin' through the cactus 
As he's gallopin' along:

""Oh, I've rid from San Antony 
Through the mesquite and the sand
I'm a rarin', flarin' bucko, 
Not afraid to play my hand.
Well, I'm a hootin', shootin' demon 
And to have my little fun
On my pinto called Apache 
And Adolphus that's my gun.""

Well straight to Santa Fe he drifted, 
And he mills around the town
Sorta gittin' of his bearin's 
As he pours his liquor down
But he's watchin', always watchin',
Every hombre in the place,
Like he's mebbe sorta lookin' 
For some certain hombre's face.

Then one night he saunters careless 
To the place of Monte Sam
And he does a bit of playin' 
Like he doesn't give a damn.
Then all at once it's hushed and quiet, 
Like a calm before the blow,
And the crowd is tense and nervous, 
And the playin stopped and slow.

At the bar a man is standin', 
Sneerin' as his glances lay,
Like a challenge did he fling 'em, 
Darin' 'em to make the play.
Two-Gun Blake, the Texas killer, 
Hated, feared wherever known
Stood and drank his glass of mescal 
With assurance all his own.

Then the eyes of Blake, the killer, 
Met the glance of Dobe Bill
And they held each one the other 
With the steel of looks that kill,
Then the tones of Blake came slowly, 
With a sneer in every word
""Well, you've found me!"" 
But the other gave no sign he saw or heard.

Walkin' calmly toward the speaker, 
He advanced with steady pace
Then he grinned, and quick as lightnin', 
Slapped him squarely in the face.
""Shoot, you snake!"" he whispered hoarsely. 
""Shoot, you lily-livered cur!""
""Draw! You're always strong for killin'; 
Now I'm here to shoot for her!""

Some there was that claimed they saw it, 
As the killer tried to draw
But there's no one knows for certain 
Just exactly what he saw;
I'll agree the shootin' started 
Quick as Blake had made his start 
Then a brace of bullets hit him 
Fair and certain through the heart.

As he fell, his hand was graspin' 
For the gun he'd got too late
With the notches on it showin' 
Like the vagaries of fate.
And the man who stood there lookin' 
At the killer as he lay
Murmured: ""Nell, I've kept my promise. 
I have made that scoundrel pay!""

Then Dobe Bill, he went a-ridin' 
From the town of Santa Fe
On a quiet Sunday morning, 
Goin' happy on his way,
Ridin' easy on that pinto 
That he dearly loved to straddle
With a six-gun and sombrero 
That was wider than his saddle,

Was that old cavayo, old strawberry roan.

I put the blinds on him, it sure was a fight,

I gets in his middle and opens the blind, 
I'm right in his middle to see him unwind 

Well, it's oh, that strawberry roan,

He lowered his old neck and I think he unwound 
He seemed to quit living down there on the ground

He went up towards the east and came down towards the west, 
To stay in his middle I'm doin' my best, 
He's about the worst bucker I've seen on the range 
He can turn on a nickel and give you some change. 

He turns his old belly right up to the sun 
He sure is one sun-fishin' son of a gun!

I starts pulling leather, I'm blind as a bat; 
With a big forward jump he goes up on high 
Leaves me sittin' on nothin' way up in the sky 

I turns over twice, and I comes back to earth 
I lights in a-cussin' the day of his birth

He never 'lowed a possum to touch the ground
Well he treed a possum in a hollow log
You could tell from that he was a good old dog
I said ""Ya-ho Blue, you good dog you""

I'll take my axe and I'll take my horn
And get me a possum in the new-grown corn.
Well Old Blue barked and I went to see
And he had a possum up in a tree
Well the possum crawled out on the limb
Blue barked, the possum, possum growled at him
Singing ""Ya-ho Blue, you good dog you""

Well Blue what makes your eyes so red
Blue what makes your eyes so red
Blue what makes your eyes so red
You run that possum till you're almost dead
Singing ""Ya-ho Blue, you good dog you""

When old Blue died he died so hard
He shook the ground in my back yard
So I dug his grave with a silver spade
Land owered him down with a golden chain
And every link I did call his name
I said ""Ya-ho Blue, you good dog you""

Now every time I hear Blue bark
Every time I hear Blue bark
Every time I hear Blue bark
He's treeing possums in Noah's ark
Singing ""Ya-ho Blue, you good dog you""

Well I will tell you so you'll know
I'm gonna tell you so you'll know
I'm gonna tell you so you'll know
That Old Blue's gone where the good dogs go

Have you ever felt a southern night?
Free as a breeze, not to mention the tree.
Whistling tunes that you know and love so.
Southern nights, just as good even when close your eye.
I apologize to anyone who can truly say that he has found a better way.
Feels so good, it feels so good,
It’s frightening wish I could, stop this world from fighting.

Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye.
It goes running through your soul like the stories told of old.
Old man, he and his dog that walked that old hand.
Every flower touches his cold hand,
As he slowly walked by weeping willows they would cry for joy, joy.
Mystery, like there’s so many others in the trees.
Go in the night, in the southern sky.
Southern night, feels so good,
It’s frightening wish I could, stop this world from fighting.

Little joy in the illusion that they can't mess up our heads. As we're taking life as being a reward, we're constantly told that we can't afford to live it, not the way we do, cause now we're breaking the law. Is it me or is it you who thought we could live without heeding it? Now the boundaries have all shrunk to fit to lifestyles. Based on total social complicity to work ethic, media, domesticity. Staying silent in response to freedoms being so curtailed we forget we need them to exist. Variety breeds tension. Then people debate what never mentioned before: ideas deal with feelings and laws try to shape the ideas that we deal in. At the point where the ideas have spread enough distance to call it a lifestyle, we start to meet the resistance. Here in the Criminal Justice Act all our paranoia has turned out to be fact! They really ARE out to get you, so party on, dude! Now we've all been criminalised for refusing to be led. They can't control our movements-they can't close down our heads. And if you start to think they can, they've won another round towards completion of their plan to keep the people down. The more we get pushed the more we push back.

Would you notice my face in a crowd?
And could you hear the sorrow in my voice?
Helplessly crying your name out loud

Ven aqui, Ven aqui Mama
Baby girl don't you know you're a star
We could take a little trip to mi casa
Spend the night popping cris in the hot tub
See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do
5'5' brown eyes with your thick thighs
Every time I see your smile its got me hypnotized

Mira (So can I get your number?)
Mi amor me ama bien
Te encantara si quisieras lo tendras
(I don't know what you said, but I like it)
Dondequiera, soy notada
Lo que que me hayo me consigo
Y morena, ojos negros
Y sonrisa soleada

Everywhere I go I'm spotted
And everything I want I got it
5'5 with brown eyes
Smile like the sunrise

Everywhere I go I'm spotted
And everything I want I got it

City High,"They just gave up on our entire generation
So we were all pushed to the side
'cause we didn't see the world through our teacher's eyes
When all we needed was a little bit of motivation
But because we wore our pants saggin'
y'all labelled us gangsters
And said we wasn't worth the time

There are so many things I never asked you
There are so many things I still don't know
There are so many things you never told me
And still so many things that I will never know
And why 
'cause I went to City High

A school with more drop outs than sign-ups at registration
And the pregnancy rate is at an all-time high 
We all know why
Now you would think the classroom's the place for mental stimulation
But there's some brothers outside
Sellin' that stuff 
That'll really stimulate your mind
(Talk about gettin' high)

There are so many things you never showed me
There are too many things you let slip by
(You let slip right on by)
How can I face a world that doesn't know me
A world that doesn't care whether I live or die
And why 
'cause I went to City High
So

We don't need your education
We don't want no pacifier
We are the leaders of your nation
We're gonna make sure the world survives
There ain't no justice there's just us
What happened to the meaning of ""In God we trust""
So as we get older and our children grow up
We ain't gonna teach them what y'all showed us

There's too many babies dyin' before they're born
(Lord ain't that the truth)
Too many young ladies cryin' with a daddy in the house
But not a father in the home 
(Now y'all know there's a difference)
And what about all our young soldiers being led astray
(By this negative music)
What happened to the Isaac Hayes
And the Curtis Mayfield's and all the Marvin Gayes?
Man we really need 'em today

And there were so many things that needed explaining
But you said it was too late for me to learn
You were suppose to be my shelter when it was rainin'
But instead you left me out here all alone
So I gotta make it on my own

We don't need your education
We don't want no pacifier
We are the leaders of your nation
We're gonna make sure the world survives
There ain't no justice there's just us
What happened to the meaning of ""In God we trust""
So as we get older and our children grow up
We ain't gonna teach them what y'all showed us

SPOKEN
For people who did believe
What we could do to change our future
You knew the world was in our hands
Help build them strong so they can withstand
All the pressures
All the war
All the prejudice
And the others who were sure we couldn't fight the stress in life
For those of you who didn't believe us
Listen to my words for you
Listen to your children sing to you

We don't need your education
We don't want no pacifier
We are the leaders of your nation
We're gonna make sure the world survives
There ain't no justice there's just us
What happened to the meaning of ""In God we trust""
So as we get older and our children grow up
We ain't gonna teach them what y'all showed us

It was two weeks before my son's birthday
The DT's ringing my bell
(Mam' we need to ask a few questions)

The told me the raid would go down anyday
And if I was smart I wouldn't tell
It was all over him yaw, my boyfriend the criminal
He was caught up in the game

And the FBI warned if I didn't go along
They'd make sure I never saw
My son or my boyfriend again
(Remember this, you are a convicted felon on probation)

But how could I just turn him in
(Mam' if you don't help us you'll never see your son again, trust me)
He would always tell me...

Lean on my shoulder, soon it'll be over
I'm trying to build our future
I'm doin' this for us
You're the only one I love, the only one I trust

I've been with him for about 4 years, and I swear
He gave me anything I could dream (anything)
But the life that he lived was a nightmare, I swear
It wasn't clean, he was blinded by the cream

All the murderous capaz, the trips to Las Vegas
Makin' millions from paper, blood-stained
Stuck in my head like a song, I saw every sin knew every wrong
And if I didn't go along, I'd never see my family again

(So what's it gonna be?)
(I know my life)
(One phone call from me and you're son's going to a foster home, answer the question)

It was Saturday evening, we were home watchin' TV
He looked in my eyes, I wanted to cry
My son ran to hug him and kissed him goodnight
How could I do this? Plain do this when I knew he would die?

The Fed's rushed the door, yelled â??everyone on the floorâ??
My man pulled his arm, and started to fire
He was a soldier of cause in a war he couldn't win
But with out him I'm lost

So I stood by his side and went down with him
Oh, no no no no, no no no no, ya ya ya ya, oh
Whoo he would always tell me...

See I'm not the bitch, but payback is
And what you did, came back to you

About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonnie, she went to Junior High with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lots changed since I seen you last""

Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello

With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way

Deeper than the deep blue see is

Claire Hamill,"There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord
And those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flame, the sword

Stars in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season, returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame

And so it must be for so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price

And stars in your multitudes
Lord, let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind wrong
I will never rest
And just to share
It's pleasures and belong
It's pleasures and belong
That's what I've been here for all along
Each day, till then, this I swear
This I swear by the stars
By the stars
By the stars

Look down and see the beggars at your feet
Look down and show some mercy if you can
Look down and see the sweepings of the street
Look down, look down upon your fellow man",Stars

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song

I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there

Singing my life with his words

Claire Hamilton,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight",Wonderful Tonight
Claire Lynch,"Oh Lord, when You hide Your face from me
And I pass through the darkness of my soul
Unaware that the shadow of Your rings
Is keepin' me from standin' in the cold

[Chorus]
Somewhere out of the darkness
I need a light to shine
Fair as the moon, bright as the sun
Oh, I need You to lead me on, lead me on

And when this calloused heart turns into stone
And the shadows are falling on my mind
Turn around in Your silence, hear my voice
I'm prayin' for Your mercy one more time

[Chorus]

Lead me on, I will follow, lead me on
Oh, lead me on, I will follow, lead me on

Traveling through the shadows of the night

Claire Lynch,"Well I was born with a dark cloud above me
A longing deep in my soul
I was raised up right and I know my momma loved me
But I begged her to let me go

I said, ""The grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'till I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride""

You know, I love you, my true companion
You've been my lifelong friend
But there's a hunger inside me
That I can't abandon 'till I see what's around the bend

You know, the grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'till I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride

Claire Lynch,"It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
Closin' time, another day is done
When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job, Lord, he's found a gun

He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
They let the ol' man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazin'
And already he can feel that great relief

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars?
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shootin' at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars?
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

Evening news it carries all the details
He dies in every living room in town
In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries, ""We'll never live this down""

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars?
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?
Fly like eagles out among the stars

Claire Lynch,"I remember the day that I met you
As clear as a blue in your eyes
I knew from the moment I saw you
We’d have a love for all time

Now years after years it still growin’
Like the flower that blooms on the vine
Oh, say that you’ll love me forever
Sweetheart darlin’ of mine

Sweetheart darlin’ of mine
I’d search this world over then I never find
A love as true or as kind
Sweetheart darlin’ of mine

You can tell what this life as do offered
Or just what tomorrow will own
But I know this old world will keep spinnin’
And together someday will grow old

Every evening the stars will keep burnin’
Every morning the sun will still shine
Just as long as I have you beside me

If there was any way out, where I could slip away and make my mind at ease

Alone,
Well his memory's so strong I can sweep it up with a broom

If I shed any more I'm afraid they might wear out my face

And the, train may be long gone from the station

You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you

Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the earth below

You're nearer than the Ivy to the the wall is
Nearer than the winter to the fall is
Leave me but when you're away
You'll know you're nearer for I love you so

You're nearer for I love you so

Claire Voyant,"Holding open time to rest awhile
I am playing in the darkness of warm July
Tryst between the scenes not happy,
As it seems you play with forgiveness
For wicked schemes

I know years ago
I know nowâ?¦
You seem like some devil
You play like some god

Clean before the stream to innocence you cling
The beauty in the crime is you don't feel; a thing

Scars we wore years ago hurt now
You seemed like some devil
And you prayed like you were god

These roses form a ring around your cell
In these ashes
We all fall down
Hold on to the divine we'll all fall down.

Stars I wished on years ago burnt out
You seemed like some devil
You played like some god

These roses form a ring around our selves in the ashes we all fall down
Hold on to the divine we'll all fall down.

Claire Voyant,"Lock of time hidden in my breath
Of things real and things I've dreamt
Holding hearts in balance it is like
Maybe we were once intertwined
Raising souls up to the moon as we

Rise again,
Maybe then we will meet
Only tides are racing through your mind
Make a wish and then goodbye
Charlatans in the ruse tonight
Where heat and light touch the sky
And the sun is rising slow there's more to write
Lock of time written in my heart
Why were we once torn apart
Only tides are racing through your mind and each
Time we meet it's bittersweet

Clancy Hayes,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

I picked your photos up today. 
I talked for hours amongst the dead & searched the half-life places but your still not here with me. I loved you more than I could ever breathe. I miss you more with every day. Inside me here behind my eyes to me you've never faded, your face won't leave me till the clay. From dark to dark I walk the streets & try to find a reason, I'll be here searchin till the grave. I whisper words into my hands & leave them fall onto your grave hoping that somehow they'll go though the soil & you'll hear them. And every drop of rain that falls on the back of me neck I keep thinkin is that your answer to me somehow.",Everyday

Clannad,"Rising early out of bed
Across the fields I steered O
When O and I a woman I spied
And a pretty fair maid appeared O.
Her head was bare I do declare
She had neither hat nor feather on
And she stopped so low gave me to know
It was mushrooms she was gathering O.
O gathering O
And she stopped so low gave me to know
It was mushrooms she was gathering O.
Where are you going says my dear
Why are you up so early O
I've seen you on the dewy grass
Before the sower Ferdio.
Quite modestly she answered me
And she said I gathering mushrooms
To make my Mammy ketchup O.

And she said I am gathering mushrooms

Her heart was like a feather O

Clannad,"'Tis the last rose of summer
Left blooming alone.
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone.
No flowerer of her kindred

No rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes
Or give sigh for sigh.

I'll not leave thee thou lone one
To pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping
Go sleep thou with them;
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed

Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.

So soon may I follow
When friendships decay

And from loves' shining circle
The gems drop away!
When true hearts lie withered
And fond ones are flown

I wouldn't ask for a dowry with her, I'm rich enough myself,
I own Cork, big as it is both sides of the glen and Tyrone,
And if I don't change my ways I'll be the heir for County Mayo.

But playing and drinking with new young women by the mountain.
If I lost my wealth and I don't think I lost my sense,
And your kiss is no more to me than a show worn for a year.

But marry a young man, my Leo, even though he lives but a year,
Or you'll still be without a daughter or son above you,

I am a boy from ireland and I'd coax a nice young girl,
I wouldn't ask for a dowry with her, I'm rich enough myself,
I own cork, big as it is both sides of the glen and tyrone,
And if I don't change my ways I'll be the heir for county mayo.

Cow herding, my leo, I did not never practice,
But playing and drinking with new young women by the mountain.
If I lost my wealth and I don't think I lost my sense,
And your kiss is no more to me than a show worn for a year.

My love and treasure, don't marry the old grey man,
But marry a young man, my leo, even though he lives but a year,
Or you'll still be without a daughter or son above you,
Crying in the afternoon or in the morning hard.

[from larry keith ogle]


On the green stubble-fields of autumn
I saw you, my sweetheart.
Nice were your feet in shoes
And wonderful your nimble gait.
Your hair the color of roses
And your ringlets tightly plaited
Alas that we're not married
Or on board ship sailing away

The boys around here are
Laughing and getting bold
And the people of the high straw?
Are making ? ? of my brown girl
If the king of spain would
Go abroad with his assembled men
I would flatten grass and rank grass
And I would be with my brown girl

Buying cows at the fair
If I were ? and my brown girl
Go and come first love
Until we go over to gaoth-bearra
Until we separate from each other
The tops of the branches and the swan
From the waves ?
That won't separate us
And it's only folly for you to put it ? ?

I wrote a letter
To my sweetheart and a sharp complaint
She sent it back to me
That her heart was inside me.
Compose the artsswannoble person ?
Finer than silk or bird feathers
Heavy is my sigh
When I think of being apart from her.

What I heard on Sunday
As conversation among the women
That she was going to be married
To a young man from the place.
Sweetheart take my advice
And this autumn stay as you are
And don't tell anyone, my love,
That you are my love.

Clannad,"Came upon an ancient forest
A guided path had led me there
Walking through the mystic forest
The legend tales and times gone by

Voices whisper in the black night
Refection deep in wooded lands
A floating mist that circles shadows
The legend tales and times gone by

Giant trees are folding me
In the many years and ages past
Will they ever share the answer
Of the legend tales and times gone by?

Clannad,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you, right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
But something's lost and something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

English Translation From Jason Carns
Down by the beach, in the deep of night
The big world is sleeping and I am alone
The sea-birds are calling sorrowfully
Like poor souls in pain
Total purity and total abundance (?)
Bliss and calmness and beauty in the world
The murmur of the sea going into my ears
The soft song of the water flowing in the river.
Above on the headland* there is a blessed old cemetery
The place in which saints lived in times long ago
There are people within spending a while carefree
The will not walk round on the shore any more.
Loneliness strikes my spirits as I look at the cemetery
And I'm thinking about the people in there sleeping
Men and young women, old people and children
People of my people and friends of my heart.
The cocks are crowing and the stars are fading
The moon is setting and it's not long until day
Goodbye now blessed old cemetery
And to the people who walked with me down by the beach.

It means something like this.

Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,"Human shit and cigarettes
And weekends away in the city

You just call me up to tell me
You're gone when I already know
You couldn't stand it any longer

A Mexican engineer
Who told me I should do some running
Before it gets too goddamn late
Now stealing cars in Guanajuato

The drag queen comes to the window
She says I'd been told you had already gone
Why don't you stay a little longer?

Clara Nunes,"Na tina, vovó lavou, vovó lavou
A roupa que mamãe vestiu quando foi batizada
E mamãe quando era menina teve que passar, teve que passar
Muita fumaça e calor no ferro de engomar

Hoje mamãe me falou de vovó só de vovó
Disse que no tempo dela era bem melhor
Mesmo agachada na tina e soprando no ferro de carvão
Tinha-se mais amizade e mais consideração

Disse que naquele tempo a palavra de um mero cidadão
Valia mais que hoje em dia uma nota de milhão
Disse afinal que o que é de verdade

Ninguém mais hoje liga
Isso é coisa da antiga, ai na tina

Hoje o olhar de mamãe marejou só marejou
Quando se lembrou do velho, o meu bisavô
Disse que ele foi escravo mas não se entregou à escravidão
Sempre vivia fugindo e arrumando confusão

Disse pra mim que essa história do meu bisavô, negro fujão
Devia servir de exemplo a ""Esses nego pai João""
Disse afinal que o que é de verdade

Ninguém mais hoje liga
Isso é coisa da antiga, oi na tina
