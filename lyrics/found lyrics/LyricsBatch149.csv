Good Charlotte,"Woke up a million miles away from who I am
Like when we stayed up every Saturday 'til 4 A.M
But the times they change around here, don't they?
'Cause some things never change
Like the things you say

I keep searching for a reason to stay
And everything you do just pushes me away
I'm gon' keep on trying 'cause we been here before
I'm gon' keep on trying 'cause I said that I won't let you go again
So I'm just searching for a reason to stay right here
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh, oh, 
Give me a reason to stay
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh, oh, 
Give me a reason

Woke up a million miles away from who we were
I really thought I had it made, yeah, I was sure
But the times they change around here, don't they babe?
I got my mind made up and I'm staying 
Right here babe

I keep searching for a reason to stay
And everything you do just pushes me away
I'm gon' keep on trying 'cause we been here before
I'm gon' keep on trying 'cause I said that I won't let you go again
So I'm just searching for a reason to stay right here

All the things we said, they keep running around
Around in my head, around in my head (For this reason, I'll keep on going)
Oh, all the things we said, they keep running around
Around in my head (For this reason, I'll keep on going)
Around in my head again, again, again

Now I can't let go
I keep searching for a reason to stay
And everything you do just pushes me away
I'm gon' keep on trying cause we been here before
I'm gon' keep on trying cause I said that I won't let you go again
So I'm just searching for a reason to stay right here

Good Charlotte,"If it makes you happy
You can ride that feeling
Keep your eyes open and go in alone

If it makes you wonder
If you're going under
You can hold on 
You can stick to your guns",Stick to Your Guns (Interlude)
Good Charlotte,"Three stops, it was not enough
Two hearts that were broken up
One spark and we got together
Three nights that we spent alone
Two days I couldn't stay away
One life that we can spend together

I can feel you start to pull away
When I'm going insane

Baby have I gone too far now?
I shouldn't let the words come out
I'm giving you the same old speech again
Like they do on CNN
The ticker goes across the screen
And you're just sitting next to me
And now I'm left covering my mouth
You're just walking out
Don't leave me stray, I'm just a dog without you
Don't leave me stray, I'm just a dog without you
Hey, I'm just a dog without you
I'm just a dog without you

My car where I sat alone
I called but you weren't at home
I'll try to keep it together
We said there was little time
We said it was low or high
We swore for the worst or better

I can feel you start to pull away
When I'm going insane

Baby have I gone too far now?
I shouldn't let the words come out
I'm giving you the same old speech again
Like they do on CNN
The ticker goes across the screen
And you're just sitting next to me
And now I'm left covering my mouth
You're just walking out
Don't leave me stray, I'm just a dog without you
Don't leave me stray, I'm just a dog without you
Hey, I'm just a dog without you
Hey, I'm just a dog without you

Here I go, on my own
Just another stray you know
If a dog is who I am
I hope you never let me go
Here I go, on my own
Just another stray you know
If a dog is who I am
I hope you never let me go

Baby have I gone too far now?

Good Charlotte,"It always hits you the hardest when you are not ready
You better get ready, 'cause here it comes (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You know the pain, the fear, the hurt, or did you forget it?
Do you remember now? Here it comes (oh-oh, oh-oh)

Do I need help? Am I talking to myself?

You know it's always dark before the light (oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's always peace and quiet before the fight (oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're always on the front lines at the worst time
We got the best hearts, but we got sick minds
Love is all-out war tonight (oh-oh, oh-oh)

So let me break this down, 'cause I won't be caving in
And my beautiful enemy, she won't run (oh-oh, oh-oh)
And when we stop this now, we'll lose all our sanity
Just like enemies, we come undone (oh-oh, oh-oh)

Do I need help? Am I talking to myself?

You know it's always dark before the light (oh-oh, oh-oh)

We're always on the front lines at the worst time
We got the best hearts, but we got sick minds
Love is all-out war tonight (oh-oh, oh-oh)

I hear a scream and find
No peaceful days alone, no starlit night
Until the day I die, you've become the banner of my life
So when they rise up against you
I'll be standing here right beside you

Just like war, just like it's war
So when they rise up against you
I'll be standing here right beside you
Just like war, war, war
Just like war, war, war
You can have my life tonight

You know it's always dark before the light (oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's always peace and quiet before the fight (oh-oh, oh-oh)

Good Clean Fun,"The Ice Cream Man Cometh
Out on the streets a hot summer's day,
The kids getting hungry as they frolic and play,
Then comes the ringing sound it signals the plan,
They quickly surrounded the evil white van,
Eleven years old, but they didn't flinch,
Their watergun barrels did not move an inch,
The driver was guilty, but he had no clue,
Raised in a system he'd never thought through,
And the kids - TOGETHER,
They fought as one and they beat the man,
And the kids - TOGETHER,
They sowed us all how to make a stand,
From that day on, the dairy was gone,
He tried to fix what he had done wrong,
""GOOD BYE GOOD HUMOR, cruelty's not nice"",
He said as he sold treats made from soy beans and rice,
'cause it's never too late to see the light,
To change your ways and do what is right,
The war wasn't over but the battle was won,
And now the neighborhood could have GOOD CLEAN FUN,
Well now you know the story,
And now you know it's true,
If little kids can change the world,
Just think what we could do.

Good Fellas,"Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
""Candy""
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine
Mine",Candy
Good Fellas,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Good Old War,"How long, how long
Can you keep it going
You have to know this is wrong
Can't help but cry
Are you coming home?
Or staying up, staying out
Waiting for the sun to come

Got me thinking that it's all just a part of your plan
Got me thinking that you're hiding something

You only wear those heels when I'm not around
Taking a break from your lonely life
After the party
I'm here and you're not home
You're staying up, staying out
Waiting for the sun to come

Got me thinking that it's all just a part of your plan

Oh, after the party
Don't go hiding from me
Oh, after the party
I feel like a dead man walking

No one likes the rain
When it rains all the time
We only like the rain
When the flowers are dying

will ripple this disguise

so i'm right where i am tied to this bed

what i said to both of my parents because i made my mother cry
if they'd only wait i'll make it up to them because i can be a better man

i'll watch the morning break

it's as close as i'll ever be",Better

Good Riddance,"Well I thought we'd arrived at a tract in our history
Where we'd fought every endeavor we could fight
Yet I shuddered with grim preconception
As the cannonade erupted into light
And my ocular gaze lay dehiscent
It seemed that I could not look away
And every god fearing son was a patriot
And victory remained elusive
Just one bomb away
Oh yeah one bomb away

and they say that customs will reconcile people
To any atrocity - (George Bernard Shaw)
From dachau to belfast to baghdad
From sea to shining sea

and they say that when fascism crosses our borders
It'll be wrapped up in a shroud
Glowing red, white, and blue
And our rectors they say will explain it away
As the ravings of a passionate few

well I happened to visit a slaughterhouse
Where cessation's redolence rose to the sky
And propitious creatures await a most virulent fate
Which their pacific demeanor belies
It was a place I don't care to return to
Whose chambers compassion would not recognize
Where slaughter is sanctification
And humanity covers it's eyes

covers it's eyes

my country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing of thee I sing

I don't want to be a patriot
If being a patriot means being like you

I used to be like her I used to call her friend

She was a lost child running way too fast
No matter where she went she could not get away
There's a voice reverberating deep inside my head
Telling me I should have made her stay

'cause now there's no one but me
And I feel the sting

There was a time she was beautiful
She had so much life to give
But now all I remember is the broken shell
I see in my nightmares
I can hardly recognize her

Doesn't it feel good
Doesn't the sting feel good",Lisa
Good Riddance,"i woke up screaming
just the other night
awakened by another dream

i thought back to '80
thinking what would've happened
if everything wasn't how it seemed

ten years the lie survives
fucking with american lives
reduced to pawns in a power play

too long they've suffered
not for america
just for a lead on election day

running out of time

my october my america

Good Riddance,"Cover of the Kinks:
They put a parking lot on a piece of land
When the supermarket used to stand.
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local palais.
That's where the big bands used to come and play.
My sister went there on a Saturday.

Come dancing,
All her boyfriends used to come and call.
Why not come dancing, it's only natural?

Another Saturday, another date.
She would be ready but she's always make them wait.
In the hallway, in anticipation,
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration.
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.

Come dancing,
That's how they did it when I was just a kid,
And when they said come dancing,
My sister always did.

My sister should have come in a midnight,
And my mom would always sit up and wait.
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late.

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight,
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate.

The day they knocked down the palais
My sister stood and cried.
The day they knocked down the palais
Part of my childhood died, just died.

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band,
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand.
My sister's married and she lives on an estate.
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.
She knows they get away with things she never could,
But if I asked her I wonder if she would,

Come dancing,
Come on sister, have yourself a ball.
Don't be afraid to come dancing,
It's only natural.

Come dancing,
Just like the palais on a Saturday.
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play.",Come Dancing
Good Riddance,"I never knew how good I had it
I had to treat you like a habit
It became what I'd guess you call a slight obsession
Now I've had some time to work it out
Way too much time to be without
The one I've wanted
You're my right direction

When you're back there
Do you think of me
When you're alone
Before you sleep
You are the one
I'm waiting for
This time's not like before
I'm going to carry you away

Thinking good things now
I know we'll work it out somehow
I try to keep my chin up but it's so hard to let you go
It never hurt before to be alone
Now your voice is salvation on the phone
I only wish you weren't so far away",Think of Me
Good Riddance,"And what about the times you did your best
To assuage my troubled soul
What happened to me
What happened to you
What was it that you said would see us through
I want to know how to feel something real
And I will try no more to run
All this pressure getting closer
And it seems like I've been here before

Time on my hands
Weight of the world
Laid bare my soul
As I lose control

Run away
You can retrace those steps and find your way once more
I'll wait
Believe in yourself as the cruel world closes in
Take my hand
I'll be a friend for you this weight you bare alone
One day
The light I know will illuminate your heart",Weight of the World
Good Riddance,"I've thought it through & I think you're right
And you're not missing much
There's something pure
That you can't hold against a simple touch

So many choices and the pressure
We all bring to bear
Your strength works miracles
And touches those who try to care

I believe in you
And I hope you see it through
Your resolve is inspiration in my life
It takes a lot now

So few who feel the same
When it means enough
Not to give it away now
Finding it hard

Not to think in terms of yesterday
Finding it strange
That somebody else could feel that way
It must be hard sometimes

To stand behind your chastity
And I wish that I could be the one
But it's not me I'll never set you free
Hold on because you've got a lot to believe in",Holding On
Good Riddance,"I'd set myself on fire
I'd sacrifice desire
It will be great don't get me wrong
We can forget it won't be long

I can't hold myself
Tear this heart away
Just a moment then it's gone
Insignificant

Contrary to suggestion
I've answered way too many questions
I feel that chill run dawn my back
All systems go I can't relax

I can't hold myself
Tear this heart away
Just a moment then it's gone
Insignificant

I'd set myself on fire",Sacrifice
Good Riddance,"She called me up all excited said she had a date
With him Saturday night and she just can't wait
I thought about his reputation & the things that he's done
I woudn't wish him on anyone
I said to her when you're with him better watch your step
Because I know this boy he's got a pretty bad rep
I only hope he doesn t end up bringing you down
He's been breaking hearts all over town
Slowly you can pick yourself back up
When that situation's got you down again
Slowly you can pick your self back up
Girl you've got to save it for another day
Because you don't need him anyway
It's just a game they play
I know this won't come easy girl
I know that it's hard
And deep down inside it leaves an awful scar
And to say I told you so
Won't help to ease the pain inside you so
Just remember that there's plenty of boys out there
Who could treat you much better
And remember I care
It just won't do to see you hurting so bad
I knew that boy was going to leave you sad



",Slowly
Good Riddance,"Have we really lost our way
I heard the people talking but I can't believe
The things they say
Seems like a million days
Since we chose a new direction
Tried to find the strength to change
Do you remember when 500 stood as one
And reached for the sky
Our pride was understood
Friendship & brother (sister) hood
Gave us the courage to try
Sometimes it's such a lonely road
Despair is everywhere
So much anger to unload
But I'll fight with every breath
In my heart I still believe
We can make a difference somehow



",Understood
Good Riddance,"Who will be their voice
Who will hear their cries
The ones who cannot speak
As we dehumanize
Incarcerated innocents
Their sentience ignored
Slaughtered by the millions
For the pseudo-carnivores
What a waste of our time
Of our land of our humanity
Blood-spattered carcass it wets your appetite
Don't you fucking get it
Eating flesh it isn't right for you
For me our children the world
Destroy their machines
Burn their staughterhouses to the ground
Now it's time for us all to defend
The oppressed
Meat is murder
Still we consume the dead and rotting
Products of violence
We've got to make that change
For you for me our children the world

Good Riddance,"It streaks across the sky towards Bethlehem
A shining star filled with hope and love.

It's the second coming
The new Christ won't survive
It's a second coming
The Christ will die

He thinks he'll rid the world of it's sins.
But he'll feel the nails go right into his hands.

Think about the first time that he came
All the millions that died in his name
The apocalypse is oh so near
Soon enough we'll be in darkness.
When the world finally got wise
He got a spear right into his side.",Second Coming
Good Riddance,"I remember the day that we met
I needed someone, you needed someone too, yeah
Spend time takin' all you could get
Givin' yourself was one thing you never could do
You played with my heart, played with my head
I got to laugh when I think of the things you said
'Cause I stole your love, Stole your love
Ain't never gonna let you go
I, oh yeah, stole your love, I stole your love stole your love, I stole your love

You never stop runnin' around
You pick me up, then you could still put me down
You were the girl that nobody could own
Stay for a while, then you would leave me alone
I'm somethin' different, ain't like the rest
How does it feel to find out you're failin' your test",I Stole Your Love
Good Riddance,"I can't pull in all the stops
But it rained on all of this
With the sirens in my sleep
And her sorrow at my kiss

I can't turn away
Hold the half turn when you pray
All the vanity and fate
Written on her crazy face

Here in my head I here you say
Here in my head I here you pray

Time is what it's made
Made by all those I regret
""remember me"" I hear it said
Other faces I'd forget

Hope you get up off your feet
Shake the dust out of your shoes
City lights and all my jazz
And all my demonstrations too

Here in my head I here you say
Here in my head I here you pray

Time is what it's made
Made by others I regret
Remember we are here and sad
All the faces I'd forget

Here in my head I here you say
Here in my head I here you pray
Here in my head I here you say
Here in my head I here you pray



",In My Head
Good Riddance,"I feel like I'm not wanted here
And I wonder what I'm living for
Discerning eyes are burning me
They make me feel like an outlaw

Do you need a uniform
To see the band tonight
Are the people here for fun
Or maybe looking for a fight

You can't come in if you don't look right
Doesn't the music make it right
It seems fashion keeps the youth confined
We have missed the whole idea
I thought we listened with our ears
But we keep them closed with fear

Brutality and snobbery
Will keep the cults at war
It's just music why such hate
There's nothing to be solved at all

You can't come in if you don't look right
Doesn't the music make it right
It seems fashion keeps the youth confined
We have missed the whole idea
I thought we listened with our ears
But we keep them closed with fear

You can't come in if you don't look right
Doesn't the music make it right
It seems fashion keeps the youth confined
We have missed the whole idea
I thought we listened with our ears
But we keep them closed with
Keep them closed with
Keep them closed with
Fear

Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie,"You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected
A hurt, scorned, rejected

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum
My father left, he never even married mom
I shared the guilt my momma knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we may be creating

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, (scorned by) society
Love child, always second best
Love child (different from), different from the rest

Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)

I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

Don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't want to please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

Love child, love child, never quite as good
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood

But I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you",Love Child

Hollin they got rank
See Sega ain't in this new world order 
Them experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas
They trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain't knocking or asking
Them coming for niggas like me
Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps lace with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me
Later on in the future look it up
Where they say it?  Ain't no more Constitution
In the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents seat off despair
Them say expect no mercy
Foot you should be my least worries got to deal with
Where my W-2's, 10-99's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking got a hit of the blow it's powerful
Oh you know what else they tryin to do
Make a curfew especially for me and you the traces of the new world order
Time is getting shorter if we don't get prepared
People it's gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious

If the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in

And ain't sixteen years old, this shit has got to stop

I want outta this hold I'm in a cell under attack
Lock up folks they in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know
Cause it's kept low how the new world plan
Reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your angle, try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy you dish now
No more fishing for your fish

The last words that the nurse heard was the song she sang
Died tired of this living thing
Most I knew never made it to drinking age
Sometimes I fight Gipp
Should I spend or should I hold on for what tomorrow brings
Fly ain't that roll egg, so many lips in my head
Seeing some act up from one taste out the cup
Can't build me up to cut me down
Gipp is in your game, but Gipp won't play your game
In the day after

I been this way since birth
Heaven upon sent a newborn to tell it like he see it
No lies thru the eyes of an angel suggest you don't tango
Every angle be obtuse, ain't no truce, it's war
It won't stop, to compromise wouldn't stop the bloodsheddin'
It's Armageddon in the streets of each inner city
Ain't takin' no pity on this unjust callin' it trust
I'm on the bus starin' out of a window
Thankin' 'bout them happy days I had
Over the summer growin' up fast to face life and harsh realities
That come wit the territory didn't know when I was young
So many get hung to hang
Take away the bad and bring back
The good that die mostly over bullshit
Takin' a gun and pulled it on an innocent friend of mine
That could have been yours
How can I stop the war and all the crime inside the minds that's
Programmed to destroy
From the beginning when will it end
On the day after judgement

I'm so happy we made it
I knew one day we would
All these years of strugglin'
Were never understood
Now my eyes are open and I can clearly see
We didn't die for nothin' cuz we're finally free
I'm so happy

Meant I'd be spoiled rotten
A fin here a fin there but receipts please
For my feet I need a new pair of hi rollin'
But the car ain't stolen
Pistol still smokin' from herndon homin' in on somebody
Gotta pay for restitution with heavily on my mind
Free from mental debris hose me down
There my physical frame lay returnin' to its rightful place
A quest for forgiveness answer
The death toll talley but my soul was spared
How is your prepared medium rare if you dare disobey
Well done race you the last one to orion star
Smellin' like shit in a glass jar
The bomb light years away from earth secure a space for my family
The mother of my first conceived and all the weak relatives
I hurt only when I laugh ha-ha
On display afta judge none careless atmosphere
Opportunity knockin' answer it knewin you would
Good thangs come to those dat wait
Took a loss on church strait
The nifty fifth whut better place
Fo' mo enenmy to hide than behind religion
Done gee seen on I pray for you but I won't follow you to yo end

I know of a place not too far away
That maybe you and I can both go someday
But I gotta make sure cause I ain't tryin' to stay here
Don't y'all realize that the end is so near
But don't have fear cause you still got time
I hope you wanna come when I'm done with the rhyme
Let me explain so you won't claim you didn't know
And you can make sure that this is where you wanna go
It's all about preparing yourself for the return
And a trip to your soul is the only way you'll learn
But if you choose not to go that ain't my concern
I guess in hell you'll just have to burn
The devil tell lies and try to trick yo soul to receive it
They tell you that my Lord ain't coming' back and you believe it
Regardless if you listen to me
In the end we'll see

I'm so happy we made it
I knew one day we would
All these years of strugglin'

I betcha Jedd Clampett want his money back
See East Point Atlanta threw this road block
Talking 'bout all this blow traffic got to stop
So the big time players off John Freeman Way
Had to find themselves another back street to take
Cause back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand, ""Naw nigga, that money ain't' yours""
That's when me and Big State took an oath and sweared
Never would we talk, never would we tell
So when they pulled up bumpin' ""Rock The Bells""
We took what we want and left them quiet as hell

Gipp holler at Miss Ann she said they didn't get the trap

Been on the grind with Cool Breeze, droppin' pounds with B.

I will split your ass up for real, cause we the maniacs

Them better leave me alone, I'm in my zone
Prone to snap if you offer me a chance

I can't forget my nigga's Jo, T-Mo, and Gipp
Ha-ha-ha, well Great Scott, is he a thief?
It seems like he has a mouth full of gold teeth
I smile, because your eyes can't take the glare
But Cee-Lo, him don't care, I cut off all my hair
And everybody stop and stare when we come in the place
And I can get on the mic with no time to waste
Get right up in your face, kick the flavor you taste

Goodie Mob,"You 'bout to make me slam yo' back clean out 
But I luv her till death do us part 
Though she divorced my pop the hard way 
Back in nineteen ""yassey"" for the past sixteen years 
I took on the responsibility of daddy
Ma ol' burd, puttin a real buzz in my ear makin sho' it marinate 
And not go out the other ear 
Guess who? Stood beside me when why'all wouldn't force fed when I 
Couldn't lift a spoon to my skull 
God is good, God is kind mimmicin' her taught me how to say mine 
Grace improvised wit bakin' soda when it wasn't no toothpaste 
Now what that went with my ol' burd cried tears of joy 
When she heard I wasn't gon' serve time for possession 
Of the ""sawed off"" runnin' out of spurs 
When I came home blowed and couldn't find the key hole, guess who 
Unlocked the doors, my Ol' burd puttin' my hairs out 
I better eat before you bug me to death 
Shut-up you old ungrateful ass nigga, she trying to help yo' ass
I wasn't ready to eat yet but I enjoyed the dinner she said, ""I'm glad"" 
Slid down my esophagus wit ease, even though she have this skin disease 
That won't allow me to gain weight do my own eyes deceive me 
Guess who tuck me in before I started drivin' this Benz 
Again & again, told me not to and when I did
Guess who beat the dog shit outta me kid 
My momma didn't play, shit, I had to pick the switches 
You guess who!

My momma, destination unknown, went out on her own 
She was barely even grown and became my momma 
I never knew my dad, so even when the times got bad 
I was glad cause I had my momma 
For so long she had to be strong 
I know at certain times she was wrong 
But she still my momma, it still amazes me 
The Lord had to help her raise me judging from the way I used to be 
My momma, the biggest player that I know I love her so 
Hell everything I got I owe to my momma 
Thank you for caring, thank you for sharing yo' luv 
I guess that was yo' way of preparing 
Yo' son to be the one and not the two 
To make you and my daddy's dream come true 
But what a surprise a car wreck left you paralyzed 
The sheet was pulled over yo' eyes when the doctor advised 
The family that you might not ever talk again 
But you talkin' so I know that you gon' walk again 
But take yo time, guess who's the inspiration for the rhyme, my momma 

Who was the first to hold you in some arms 
The first to change your diaper when your stomach wasn't calm 
Your momma, wit that drama brought you into this world 
From a world of down under 
I wonder now she know when I was lying, when I was telling the truth 
With the proof she would explain how I've been skipping school 
With that boys putting wholes on my back with the same belt 
Around my waist that held my pants up 
Takin' back only got you closer to Southern Bell 
Got your forehead swell 
I swear she knew when it was real or when it was fake like Clampetts 
With dreads and if I couldn't handle a situation then I fled 
Behind closed doors I froze, in Garnett holes I rose 
Who that hell got my bond 
Standing in front of that two-inch glass 
A woman ready to hand the cash over for her son
My mama!

Sometimes we get it on, I know at times I'm wrong 
Lookin' into my eyes just to let me know she tried is enough for me 
I'm callin' a truce it seems we more like brother and sister 
Even though she pay the bills wit the mister 
Brought me home in '72 and gave me all she had 
Cause I was left at birth she knew it could work 
Since she gave me the first chance my song and dance 
Pearl, my world, what would I do without her spark 
Probably be on the street wit nothin' to eat but I got a happy home 

Ever since my first day it's heaven sent now I know 
What it's meant when I say 
I appreciate what you've done and what you do your only son
Guess who?
The only one that cares for real and really understands how I feel 
Help me over come my fears and never left me through the years 
So I dedicate this song for you, for all that you brought me through 
I know there will never be another that will love me like my mother",Guess Who

Cause it's only so much time left in this crazy world
Mates in prison guards life with the hamma
So excuse ma grammar
Behind the walls of Atlanta, Federal Penn
The tait on ""Fred Stock"" the cell blox wit no C.O.'s
Equipped with radios
The system is fraud and the security camera
Now have we an eyeball on it yet
The second stage denied
I wonder if I get another trial

Remember me from way back in the days
Lived right around the corner from Benjamin Mays
I'm amazed that we made it this far
A poor black family is all that we are
Wishing upon a star
For a trace of happiness
My mama do her best but she ain't making no progress
Maybe it's a test that we all gotta pass
My situations making me grow too fast
13 and a half years old standing at the bus stop
Alone in the cold on my way to be degraded
For a fee to help get my family off this street called Sesame

Now and then I get put to the test
But I can't be stopped
Cause I gotta come true ain't go no gun
But I got my crew
Didn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
Living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?

It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
I'm ready to begin, another chance to get further away from where I've been
What I'll never forget everythang I went through
I appreciate the shit because
If I hada went and took the easy way
I wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be

Sunday morning where you eating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
Yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetty plus her monthly flow

They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had allot but thankful for
The little that I got why not be
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they slick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable

(Come an get your soul food, well, well)
Hold up C it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppis to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at tha beautiful
Jj's Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food

Goodie Mob,"Let me get a chop at this lumber niggas
From the down underground are hangin' around the A-Town
Lookin' for a come up, workin' from 9 to 5
Just to get some change so T-Mo can stay alive
Not greedy or living' lavish yet but you can bet that when I do
Nobody from my crew will I forget
And if I start to get large and come up on some change
I won't change, everybody know they down
It's not the same, everyday life can be different
These laws got me ready to ball
Cause I fall a victim so I still be slanging them fat pillows
To make 'em meet, each and every day as I comb my city streets
Sometimes I wish I never had been apart of this mess
Cause the system got us fucked up
It put us to the test, women and men if you black you in
Food for the soul listen to what I tell you it don't matter
Young or old it's time we loc' up and do like we suppose
We killin' each other over this bullshit and some clothes
We're trapped off in this world and society with no place else to go
So how you feel?

Frustrated, irritated, sometimes I don't know myself I be too numb
To feel something sometimes so I dig deep, get in the Cherokee
Let my mind fly free into the wilderness so I can get this shit off my mind
That's why I be smokin' that dank sometimes, it keeps me from snappin'
Keeps me calm, keeps my mind open, keeps me fond of what I gots to do
Off in the studio to get my old burd back on her feet, and my little bro'
In Statesboro and my little 'cause Mark Twain, all my
Folks that hang with me when I was out in the trap or when I was goin'
Through one of our episodes, only god knows, what I go through so I get down
On my knees, sometimes I come home too high to pray, but I get on my bed
Lay on my back and meditate, anyway, in the ceilings, the four walls
It's like cell therapy I got nothing to do but write about my L-I-F-E, put it
Down on paper, so what you feel?

I live for today, motherfuck another hour, it might be sour
Never know my day, so I'm prayin' in the shower
Look up and thank the Lord for forgiveness, a witness to bad
I'm lookin' for good in the Southwest, God bless my neighborhood
It's people killin' in the street to eat
Surviving the day is the only goat that I set
Just to make it home, I'm not alone
Someone's out to get me when I haven't done shit wrong

My head felt swoll, mista couldn't see past my mouth
What route did you take man
Caught me by that loops of my pants
Got me on the curb lettin' tha traffic pass me by
No questions I said nothing
Lookin' for the mutant to be buckin'
The law naw, man Gipp show him my shit
Close my mouth then I dip
See to me G is a person who understand the plan
Can't make no moves when you in the hands of the man
They got some new suites down Peachtree
Left wing for the Feds, right wing for tha hardheads
Makin' more deals than Buddy Folks made with Hartsfield
Somebody don't want my face in the place, for 96 shit's slick
Got me clean, lookin' fresh, dogs be scratchin' at my chest
Under the order of who? Guess who ain't non-iller than miller
Want to 1, 2 your ass no more life what you gave was the past
'cause ain't no future want to millicamp your case
Disgrace your face, make it seem to be safe
But ain't no place to run

Sometimes I don't even know how I'm gon' eat
'Bout twenty dollars away from being on the street
Shit, you might see a nigga on tv
But hell it's almost like I'm rappin' for free
That little money be gone, got dammit, I'm grown
Gotta help keep the heat and lights on
It would be nice to have mo' but I kinda like being po'
At least I know what my friends here fo'
I want to lie to you sometimes, but I can't
I want to tell you that it's all good, but it ain't
It's nigga's hurtin' and uncertain 'bout if they gon' make it or not
That's why we got nigga's killing
Feelin like they coming up off a little dope they sold
You can get some gold but we won't make it as a whole
Cause without you there'd be no me
And without no unity there will never be any happiness
You could smoke a pound of sess and it still won't relieve yo' stress
God bless my, thought process

The thought process
Now as an Outkast I was born, wasn't warned of the harm
That would come to meet me like Met Life, but yet life
Done sent me through a lot of up's and down like it ain't nothing'
Like elevators but I ain't the one that's pushin' the buttons
I got off at the 13th floor, when they told me that it wasn't one
They said it skipped from 12 to 14
Still smoking, still drinking, no I'm sittin' on the Lincoln
4 A.M. thinkin' that in reality the world is like a ball full of playas
We trapped off in this maze with walls made of layers
And only prayers is the tightest game that you can have
The devil's takin' a swing that might explain the broken glass
But my crystal ball see the pistol fall to the wayside
Nobody would die in cops and robbers when we used to play right

Huh, the only thang we feared was Williams, Wayne
Never though about hittin' licks or slangin' caine
Didn't think I'd be the one to give in to abortion
Label me murder because my ass is scorchin'
Hot from the glock that sits under my seat
Yeah, it's real fucked up that my folks come to get me

Goodie Mob,"Yo, I'm quite single, and occassionally I mingle
But aside from all the rest, she sparks my interest
No, ma'am, I don't know you
Just offering the common respect I feel I owe you
Also, some conversation, companionship, common-ground and common-sense
There's no such thing as coincidence in, me finding you here
And I really hate screaming in your ear, so some other time, OK?
I waited a day hello?
This is Carlito from a couple of days ago, you sound tired
Forgive me if I've called you too late
But what better time to relate mind-state? Where could I begin?
Hasn't anyone ever told you you got beautiful skin?
You're more than welcome, what do you desire within?
I just, wanna be, there's no need to put titles on you and me
Those are limitations, living and learning are our only obligations
Equality, honesty, independence, intelligence, emotion and devotion
Humbly seeking to hear God when he's speaking
At one time, my mind, just, couldn't conceive
A woman had to dress a certain way to believe
But, in the same breath, a-llow me to say
That, if you believed young lady, you wouldn't dress that way
And I, was attracted to your class, I couldn't see all yo' ass
And, I was very content, and you deserved every complement
Now, remember our indifferences make us the same
You gotta have some game, or
You ain't even gonna be able to take care of yourself, uh
And Love, when I look at you, I see my reflection
So I offer my love, affection and protection
Shawty, you dead fine, but the bottom-line is
You're still my sister

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can

Yeah, I met you and y'all knew, saw you again on Marietta
Downtown Atlanta, checkin your long legs, got me smirkin
Fixed me dinner one night, candles lit
Kinda ahought you was slick in the beginnin
But it teurned out you wouldn't lie
Looked me in my eye, I listened
Sucked it up, pushed on, we made amends, both sides clicked
True friends, since then, years done gon by
Brought a baby girl into this world, made our parents grandfolks
Household with no hope, took care of ye, you me
When shit got put out on the curb
Closer than the skin on the back of my hand
Through the thick and thin, we can win

No need to compete, with the music loud
Or stairs cold, put on a scale, of one to ten, you a twelve
I chose, her over jail and hell
Originally from ATL

Compatible souls come together, under bad weather
To discuss distrust amongst the so-called
Good in every wo-man, how I wish this was true
I deal with facts only, already done cloned me
Why I sang the blues, when there's only one God
That watches over our every step, I need his help
When I'm walkin, lookin for the right female
I can't tell sometimes
They tell me the devil's comin humble in his approach
Spontaneous with the game
He caught the naive of a girl fallin for the OK
Let the pistol smoke the one you live by
Die by, examples of how relationships can be

I rolls the dice, takin a chance at crappin out
Like today boy, I lost one of my best hips
Natural thick lips, no animal fat implants
Wide load, just started workin at the airport
19 years old, worth more than her weight in gold
But it was all my fault, so don't cry, understand
If down the line I want you back and the feelin ain't mutual
Just promise me you'll find a new man that's bout some business
Hope she find what her was lookin for, like a dreamto my end
I wanted to be more than friends

And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated woods

See summer roll around niggas holla bout change
Then they steady move them ki's like Bob James
Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives
November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individual's way to bring home
The bacon when bacon was all gone

Well a nigger uneducated, intergrated, singin' ""We shall overcome""
A nigger trying to be white is what a nigger seem like have become
And when they call me a nigger to my face'
Can't do nothin' but walk away
But here it is niggers call other niggers niggers each and every day
Dividing and conquering
When they say the lighter shade of black is okay
After the middle class and they passin' by
The project laughing at where we stay
Since a nigger had got grown, had a little bitty of nigger of my own
Should've known I couldn't show 'em no better what I was showin'
Shit, I could've hit the club as fresh as I could be
Really, all for another nigger to see
You know how a nigger get when he see another nigger outfit
Don't want nobody to have what he ain't got
Somebody get drunk, get mad, and get shot
That why the property value ain't no good in a nigger neighborhood
A nigger could overstand if he only understood
I'm sick of lyin' I'm sick of glorifyin' dyin'
I'm sick of not trying, shit I'm sick of being a nigger
Destiny sent me to this dread and she said she felt led
To offer me some wisdom from this notebook she read
And it said that right then the black man's downfall
Was not know that we were not ever niggers at all, hmm
And she looked deeply into my eyes and said brother don't you know
You complain about being black
When they mad coz they can't be black no mo'
So many black men out here trying to be niggers
Keeping it real to the point that they dying to be niggers
When in actuality the fact is you ain't a nigger because you black
You a nigger cause of how you act
But, you don't want me to tell you the truth, so I'mma lie to you
Make it sound fly to you huh, huh
You don't wanna hear the truth, so I'mma lie to you

Got a call about some work from one of them temporary agencies
No high school diploma or any college degrees
I can't enlist but they'll draft me if there's a war overseas
Oh please
Of course I can slice some OZs
But see I'm one of those aspirin MCs
And uh bills are due so at times I'm doubtful and everyone disagrees
But I'd rather struggle on my feet than to live on my knees
So my uniform tight workin all night at Mickey D's
Got about 90 dollars and some change after the government
Get they fees
These minimum wages ain't enough to feed my babies
Purposely these limitations on black folks opportunities
So I quit cuz I'm tired of being one of those overworked
Underpaid employees
Stop carin at all went on and did a few small burglaries
It seems like my faith done turned into forgotten memories
And I ain't gettin away with nothing because I know He always sees
But see right now I need to see how I can get this here dope sold
I done stuffed in my pocket as many rocks as it can hold
They gonna get high so I'm gonna get my money even though it's freezin cold
Now how many times you done heard this story told?
Believe it or not, there's some very intelligent junkies
But dependencies is eating away at they souls like disease
Anyone can turn into somebody who covets and envies
Unequal economics can easily make you some enemies
And the crime rate never drops so the cops ride around in threes
I knew he would have killed me if I did anything but freeze
They found the rest of the dope in some nearby shrubberies
In a dimlit room being questioned by these authorities
And they gave me some time in correctional facilities

The show has fallen, into the wrong hands
I am blinded, to see all that's passed
To know it was possible, to be a sadist
I have nothing, more to give
I have lost my, will to live
I lost my pride, lost my joy, and now I've lost my fear
I'd rather die, because I, am just that, unhappy here

Not long, it was sad, how you killed my son
On the four-zero-five, changin, his flat tire

Hurts my heart that we start off this year

But be, charged with rape, with all that debit

Loadin up my mac, goin to my crib, to get my 12 gauge
One of my boys just got shot, huh
Fuckin around, in that million dollar spot
A educated brother
Didn't have no money for college he was taught the street knowledge
Part of the plan
To keep us fightin in the street instead of becomin a strong black man
Every two weeks I see sam
Pitchin out my check with no respect but I still don't give a damn
Becaause I gotta make my dough
My kill, rocked down, til I started seein cash flow
Everything happens for a reason, choose the season
To commit the perfect treason
Who brought me to the land, of unfree man
To move about and catch trout, by the dozens
Even had my cousin locked down, at the feet shackled
A one-way seat, to milledgeville
Nigga this real, how can you kill another
When it's your brother? Still standing

I never thought about, talked about what I did
Just experimented life as a young gump
Them days long gone, school bells done rung no mo'
Spendin hours at the house in my favorite chair
Slow mo', custom funk fingerprinted to carry a hucklebuck
Feelin stuck with the art that my skin carries, scary
If I ever had to plot again, needin my stick
Gidgets to pidgits, moves to philly and the crew?
Nothin else to prove, fold a plot like chrome
Salt lick teddy bears in the college student's room

On the sick side, of south central
33rd avenue, block 600
Workers have wash and car details
The ese's got the fresh chevrolet's for sale
Twenty g's or better, the whole neighborhood tanked up
What? On the fortress walls, there is no letters
Buddha say, the bloods are strictly outnumbered
They beseiged, on the beats, goodie mo-b, run the creeps
Y'all can have the streets, asphault caught many suckers
Slippin on wet floors, we puttin out the signs
On krokers, c-i, t-y, such a pity
Bein suckled dry, like a newborn
On his momma's titty before I retired I hit twenty
True to cellulite with big ?Room pesquite? On the porch
Poundin, like cartoon ennis, old school efforts
Through the sunday down, crenshaw sparkin
Zoned out, off the ink, for life
Goin through time and metal detectors, I can't take my weapon
And I can't be no dope dealer
Cause they be done put a hit out on a nigga, plus I can't keep up
With them keys, locked in the fo'-do'
Backseat drivers havin out-of-body experiences
Wakin up, somewhere else still standing

Each and every element that exists in this
Universe is manifested from a thought first
Through the inner mind's eye of the unseen power in the sky
Gave birth to mother earth and all it's worth to you and I
This most loved invention, my conciousness is an extension
Of him, yet I'm flesh and bone with a mind of my own
To dig deeper than the surface, whether I learn
From your upcomings or your downfalls we all have individual purpose
It's amazing, how the streets do the majority of raising
Of children who end up dead before hearing what you said
And it's sad, so all I can write about is what I had
Interpretations of life good and bad with a pen and pad
It seems like abortion, when I just write a small portion
It's either crumpled up or torn without lettin the thought be born
Young minded, and blinded in those days I didn't want to
Have a thought that I couldn't raise, nurture, and care for
Be there for, help prepare for, the times ahead
When someone doesn't agree with what is said, huh
And if they did, don't get all arrogant cause that's my kid
Just be thankful that it's good and somebody overstood
Now, the listener in here want the same flow but I gotta let it grow
Clever enough to let it go, if I don't wanna rap no mo'
And I'll make sure that no one ever forgets
It's immortalized forever, on wax cd's and casettes
And when someone goes to the store and purchases it for ten
The life cycle starts all over again
And I was granted this music as my soulmate, to procreate
And give back what I was given, a life worth livin
And I, am still standing, unscathed
Pain is for suckers to feel
Mc's are running out of things to say, and
Radio stations running out of songs to play, shit!

Hit Atlanta live, and break a few rolls

Where do you hang?
Or do you slang?

Wear platinum rings?

I do suits while you prefer the lows
Tonight I'mma choose cause you already chose
Grown for the business and I run to flow

Really, Dungeon Family crew'll legendate 
No catching guard presence in Southwest
And everybody who believe we the best and never gonna stop
Never gonna change, try to stay focused
Still running with the same crew since 82'
All I gotta do to ?convince kids is say you'll all get big too?

How you doing miss thang 
Better yet should I say miss queen
I saw you in the corner, and you was looking off
Your smelling classic baby
I'd like to hold it snug
Lets cut a rug and split this scene and strut up out this club
I be 'bout strictly business
I make it better, get it better than the last dude
Where I hang ain't no drama momma
I reserved the bed behind the curtains
Keep it wet, keep you stuck, all up on the jewels
And keep you seeing colors like on the wall at MJQ

You wanna know how a nigga from the gutter ghetto so butter-fly
Its really on, and really I want is a moment alone
Baby please, it ain't your cheese, and [?] I'm interested
But thats on low-low, but I'd love and die til' the morn'
Every word that I'd heard her say it really inspired me
But I'm only staring cause I like what I see
But I know that you probably got a girl, and already in love
Maybe next life-time you'll be free

With some ?? we like scavengers circling your block
While you do that your ?paper drop?
You better hop jump and skip, before we dip
Because we falling through you, like the Bloods and Crips
Gotta close your eyes and start dreaming
Everybody life got a little meaning
Got to spread your wings and start flying

One nation under one rule

To be a cold little brother that you can't stop
On top of the charts, I'm a ladies man
The type of brother with heart, weak suckers can't stand

All night like a corner store, twenty-four seven
Hood hanger; we gets hot like a wok
in the Chinese kitchen, switchin up on my shoe wear
How we get down, we blew down, nigga big bank style
Sit and chill a while, wait a minute yo we blows big nigga
Sip on bottles with funny names, holla holla
Deep in this thang, keep it simple and plain
and watch my chain hang, watch my chain hang

Listen here -- I got a book that you should read
It's about me, and I suggest that to any nigga who doubt me
it will correct you, affect you, it will make shit clear
Now switch to the next nigga with that bullshit here
Keep readin -- it will also say
that if you, disrespect, anything up in this way
that will guaran-tay an awesome array of gunplay, okay?

Bouncin, bouncin, we tipsy, danceflo' is slippery
But we groovin, keepin this bitch movin
Provin, we bang in this game watch my chain hang

Back and forth, back, and forth
Style, whatchu know bout ridin out
from the Kroger parking lot to the Paramount
and Birmingham then back, punk is spittin his jack
When the leaves turn ur-ange, and you see your breath
uhh, fifteen eleven colossal
I'm weighing in at a Knighton
If you don't know nuthin else
believe that it is some ol' real niggaz

or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne
and let your chain swang, and let your chain hang

Lyric assassin while mashin they blastin come fast and
scatter from every rational imaginal
International region, under my seeds and, over these airwaves
Manipulate the rhyme with my mind so it's good to grind
through your speaker, this one's a keeper
Like Ebenezer, it was his decision, to live his life
through a tunnel vision, followed by the reaper
who knows your past deeper, don't let him creep ya, from behind

Before I was rudely interrupted, house fallin down
but we straight, you should save yourself ??
It's rainin suckers cause they greed sickens me
Poverty stricken, hand pickin, in the corner cleansin
Lights out poor, slip and you nails hell
Everythang for sale, be eat with they plastic
Let's enhance it, I'll be good til Saturday
Thick volume gravity

We bout to mix and mingle, meet a match for the next single
Money stashed away in jars like Pringles
Keep it hard for the Tunnel, we make it bump
for the 5 5 nina skull-cap boot-wearin renegade motherfuckers
Throw yo' hands up, you give it up we give it back
Yo, this is how we act when it's packed from the back
Lady don't snatch, let my chain hang
Everythang is everythang boo

Behold, the stolen soul, the ancient scroll
The game of control, roll the Swisher swoll
Open the gate away, lay to lay, I getcha gotcha greaterly
Even when you hate me, you educate me
So try to trill, I will take ya to the battlefield
Crack your motherfuckin, windshield you better yield
cause I got the right of way, night or day, alright okay
This is Carlito's Way

Whether you slang 'caine, or you gang-bang
or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne

Well I remember when, I was slanging nothing but weed
I ain't round here that can't tell you about me
Fortunately I done changed the way I used to be
When so many didn't have an alternative to see
Music saved my life and now I'll never forget it
Thats why I try to glorify God with it
But it still remains, its in my veins
I know that I'ma sin, I just hope he'll forgive me again
Okay, I'm right and wrong in the same day
And it's always gonna be someone who'll see it the same way
And if I react, who was that guy to blame, hey
You fuck with me, I fuck with you thats how the game played
I had a choice to let it go, but if you don't let it go
Then I ain't got no choice no more
Two lives gone to waste, one dead and the other caught a case
With 50 years to face
I'm raising ghosts, I'm rebuilding

And we blame it on them, but we stuck in the same frame
Trapped inside a mental instrumental bond
Hoping to run, but theres a gun, what could you really do
Everybody new kicking the old shit to the floor
But now its more shit, crooked, shady, talking 'bout the president
He's fucking other ladies, blowing up spots we supposed to hit
And casually they spreading billions to the little children overseas
Niggas moving G's, I'm on my knees praying god please
A nigga just wanna eat and sleep
With my gun in my own little world and raise my little kids
Doing the best I can nigga

Shit, look who talking now
You gots'ta crawl before you walk, Ohh don't follow to close
Where I think you might stop 
We all can see that the grass is the same color on the other side of the fence
Give thanks, people thank alarm clocks, wake 'em up
Every morning brother I gotta stay prayed up
Cause the pistol ain't gonna save my life when it's time to go
Its just in case I get a chance to retaliate
I used ain't have nothing positive to say
Doing my little five minutes of fame
Who done forget from which they came
Acknowledge his name, Lord, you've been so good to me
Better than I've been to myself
Keep us in good health

But I gots'ta be strong, to defeat my enemies

You know how these Eastpoint vets do
Can you recall riding bicycles in the trails behind?
Krissy Collins dropping Huffys like BMX's

Your first car was a Honda, my first car was a Rabbit
Cut parties with a tall can or something
Off in the 800 Ol' E, man, that old girl
She always fell, drunk off the pink champagne

Yeah, reminiscing going through adolescence with you
Hoping that these words get to you in good spirit
Your partna Gipp won't forget you, my little brother

But that don't take away from my spirit and my mind
One time for my homie Barat, and my homie Quentin
And my shawty Felicia, and my partna Floppy

You want this gold clean and shining
Don't need to remind me about the divine, he polishes
He demolish his competitors, who was the editor
To bad mouth these boys that bred in the South

Where chicken's fried on the daily and rebel flags fly
I have no love for confederate sons but guns
And no hogs' good for me, people like my type
To spark the spiritual fight with the devil off tonight

When he's white, at anytime, and any rhyme
With substance is looked at as racist
When good ol' boys is still doing hangings
And Mississippi having no pity on my color skin

Not having a choice from the begin
Little brothers like me to pose a physical threat
But check let me grab a hold of my black steel
And I'll show all y'all who's real, c'mon

Static chrome in the valley like Hercules
A lot of jealousy, envies and self hate
Don't wanna see the next man biggest escape
Up the straight big crowd finally put it down
Take your kindness for real until you bust it down
In the sail big song would be hard to crack
If you the tall tree within the small axe
Can't relax, pandemonium in hard times
We live the, ? at the faux at the finish line
People die heart is wounded massive trauma
Now it's all for the bust of marathon balls
In the valley soft kill for big faces
Others do it for the fame raising ? papers
Paper breathing ground for foreign and then making threats
In the land of the free I can do violence

When you're in the valley
The mountain tops sing for me
So I get on my hands and knees and start a fight
I don't have to look behind it
To be reminded of why
'Cause I found that living is the best way to die

I got the game, of walk around ? up to God 'cause there was dirt on it
Took a half a block and went to work on it
The same face when civilians turned savage
Back baby killers for the rights of passage
All the bys blood face smashes on the counters
Life is literally all penitentiary chances
And you can tell when someone is taking Illuminati advances
And the way he dances
You got a half heart cause it can feel as in between the buildings
And contract killers got them hanging from the ceilings
What with America in a cubicle replacing
All of your free flows will come to basement
And you can sell your soul in the black market
And ironically everyone that's black is a target
The target, the real hunger games, the real hunger pains
But I still made it to the top under where you're trying to die ?

License of fishing smile for the picture
People come to chose bring back poof
Recorded in the youth all them readers can be boof
Do what he do, he doing my survival
Arrival I may try to ?
I still live in the mind of a ? solider
Couple years older star supernova
Don't I walk though the valley of the shadow but
I fear no evil it's just people
Life will teach you only your soul

The rain, the oceans, the sun and the moon.
One time in your life you'll came to the point
When you realize.
There must be a supreme being,
And there must be God.

See the birds fly up in the sky.
Look at the mountains, the stars that shine.
God made in one by one, in seven days.
He made the golden sun to watch your ways.

Life's a wonder to little boys,
So full of hunger and full of joy.
One day you'll understand the meaning of it all,
Then you'll walk like a man, free, proud and tall.

Chorus:
Child of the sun, child of the earth,
You're just a part in God's universe.
And only God knows what will be.
He loves you till the very last day.
Child of the sun, in his hands forever you'll stay.


Close your eyes dear, here comes the night.
I wish you sweet dreams till the morning light.
I'll sing you a lullaby till the bluebird comes
And keep my eyes on you, you're not alone.

But the gates of Eden will ever be closed

That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, he smile - but she doesn't see

Göran Marcusson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Göran Söllscher,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Alone on a hill

Is keeping perfectly still

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Gord Bamford,"Sun up, we’re up, we’re dressed
A cup of coffee and a kiss goodbye
In a hurry and we always miss
The best part of a morning sky

But here we are eight hours later
At home where the world winds down
Couldn’t paint a better picture
Than the one we’re in right now

You and me in the amber glow
Side by side on the back-porch swing
Watching that ol' sun sink low
Ain’t life a beautiful thing
A little breeze and a wind-chime song
All the worries of the day let go
I’ve been waiting for it all day long
You and me in the amber glow

Long shadows slowly fading
Telling us the day is done
Move a little bit closer baby
This night has just begun

Here comes that final moment
Like a candle going out (burning down)
Can’t be no better feeling
Than what we’re feeling now

Side by side on the back-porch swing
Watching that ol' sun sink low

On the wrong side of the bed
Should have took it as a sign
And gone back to sleep instead

Oh but I just kept on moving
Trying to find my way
Nothing went right
It was one of those day, but

Tomorrow the sun is gonna shine again
And tomorrow I'll get myself a second chance
Take my wrongs, turn them round 
Get myself together 
Give me a brand new day 
And I can do it better

Should have said a prayer 
To start the day off right
Should called that friend
But I never took the time

I should have run that errand 
That my brother needed done 
But I let it go and now the day is gone, but

Tomorrow the sun is gonna shine again
And tomorrow I'll get myself a second chance
Take my wrongs, turn them round 
Get myself together

Gord Bamford,"Well I only came here for a drink
Maybe two and a bucket of wings
And you walked in and changed my mood
In your cowgirl boots and your rose tattoo
Don't wanna be all outta line
But the way you're lookin' girl is blowin' my mind
I'd be a fool to let you get away so I just gotta say

There's a groovy kind of feelin' in the air tonight
It's playin' with the rhythm of my heart
Got it beatin' just right
If you can feel it and it moves you too
I'd gladly spend the rest of this night groovin' with you

So what do you say we grab some beer
Jump in my truck and get outta here
Take a long ride down a little country road
Let the moonlight take us where it wants to go
We can park somewhere and put the tailgate down
Let the crickets and the critters be the only sound
If you wanna hang out til the morning light
Baby that'll be alright

There's a groovy kind of feelin' in the air tonight
It's playin' with the rhythm of my heart
Got it beatin' just right
If you can feel it and it moves you too
I'd gladly spend the rest of this night groovin' with you

Whoa I'll leave it all up to you
Whoa Come on girl, what do we got to lose

There's a groovy kind of feelin' in the air tonight
It's playin' with the rhythm of my heart

Old cowboy lever actions

I guess I'm old school
So in love with you I wanna grow

Just a spot in your heart, give it all
Every breath for a chance to be a fly on the wall
Wherever you are

When I get by like an unhappy camper
Think high like 'em to smile for the camera
Pass me a torch, pour me a round
Drinking a drop to buzzing around

Just a spot in your heart, give it all

And passed out in the tall grass on Portabello Road
Yeah, the sky was alive held you like a gemstone
Got lost on the way home and never told a soul

Now it feels just like it's rainin' rubber balls
You get to run like hell just to watch me crawl
Bet you just can't wait 'til the whole thing falls

And you're, you're gonna be my great regret
Though I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can get
You're the lesson I never learned, you're my sunburn

Sure cuts the groove, makes it hard to be humble
But I trip and I stumble, like a scratched 45
Now it feels just like I'm tied on to a stone
You get to step on a crack just to break my bones
Guess I got my wish, guess, I should have known

That you're gonna be my great regret
Though I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can get
You're the lesson I never learned, you're my sunburn

You change your mind like you change your shirt
You cover my skin so it don't hurt
But it don't work
It just makes it worse

You're gonna be my great regret
Though I, I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can

Roll the bones and double your bets
I got a lot to lose and a lot more to get
Gonna watch it rise and watch it set
Every drop of sweat, 'til it takes away my breath
You're the lesson I never learned you're my sunburn

You're my sunburn

Turn your head to the cries
Of loneliness in the night

The spider soon takes it's prey
Spins a dance round your heart

A pleasure pleasing my mind

In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair.

And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,

I've sung this song, but I'll sing it again
Of the people I've met and the places I've seen
Some of the troubles that bothered my mind
And a lot of good people that I've left behind, singing

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along

The sweethearts they sat in the dark and they sparked
They hugged and they kissed in that dusty old dark
They sighed and they cried and they hugged and they kissed
But instead of marriage they talked like this: honey

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along

I went to your family and asked them for you
They all said take her, oh take please do
She can't cook or so and she won't't scrub your floor
So I put on my coat, tip toed down the door, singing

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along

I walked down the street to the grocery store
It was crowded with people both rich and both poor
I asked the man how his butter was sold
He says one pound of butter for two pounds of gold, I said

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along

My telephone rang and it jumped off the wall
That was the preacher makin' his call
He said, ""we're waiting to tie the knot
You're getting married believe it or not""

The church was jammed and the church was packed
The pews were crowded from the front to the back
A thousand of friends waiting to kiss my new bride
But I was so anxious I rushed her outside, told her

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along",So Long (It's Been Good to Know Yuh)
Gordon Jenkins,"The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold

I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold

And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Let me go 'way from this lonely town
Won't be long till my song will be true

Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul

I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own
No one knows better than I myself, I'm by myself alone

I'm sure that love's an overrated past time
It's the last time I'll ever be anything but fancy free
For love is just a junior high version, one way excursion
I'm sure that I am old enough to fly alone

But what care I?
Such pride inside me has woken,
I'll try my best not to cry,
By and by,
When the final farewells must be spoken.
I'll join the Legion,
That's what I'll do.
And in some far distant region,
Where human hearts are staunch and true,
I shall start my life anew.
Good-bye, it's time
I sought a foreign clime,
Where I may find
there are hearts more kind
Than I leave behind.
And so, I go,
To fight a savage foe,
Although I know that
I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed.
In some Abyssinian French Dominion
I shall do my bit,
And fall for the flag if I must.
Where the desert sand is nice and handy,
I'll be full of grit
You won't see my heels for the dust.
I'll do or die
You'll know the reason why
When told of bold Leopold's last stand
For the Fatherland.

While others fight for power
We can walk among the flowers

I've learned about survival
I've walked with fools and kings
And I've even read the bible

There I came upon some lines
Givin' me direction
Gather not your gold on earth
Your kingdom is in heaven

But I chose to live instead
Inside the shell they gave me
'til in spite of everything
Good fortune came to find me

I tried my best to run away
But I could not avoid the feelin'
Soon I was reelin' on my feet
I made a grab at anything
The earth was gone and I was on
A vicious circle then

After I'd gone and let myself surrender
I didn't want to die at all
I thought I'd live forever

Then she gave me everything
A king could never borrow
But I twisted all her gifts
Her wisdom was my sorrow

So I left her cryin'
And roamed across the river
The angels offered me their hands
But I could not forget her

So I came to where she was
By river, road and reason
I slept beneath her window
In the moonlight summer season

But I could not go inside
I heard the sound of laughter
And the rustle of her hair upon his skin
I made a grab at anything
The earth was gone and I was on
A vicious circle then

After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow
I didn't want to live no more
Nor face the bright tomorrow

Then I remembered everything
I've learned about survival
Havin' walked with fools and kings
I've even read the bible

I remember all those lines
Givin' me direction
Gather not your gold on earth
It will not pass inspection

And still I think when I'm alone
Away from all night splendor
If gold could buy one night with her
I wish I had some to send her

Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears
Waiting through the years

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun

Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist
Dreaming of a kiss

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

But now the bitter green is gone the hills have turned to rust
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist

Last evening in a city far away
I was feelin' sad and blue
I wondered then if I should really stay
Wanting someone to be with me in the light of this uncertain time
Waiting by the window for the man inside
To please make up his mind

Will you be one who passed through but never saw
Never knowing never feeling anything
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do
Will you be one who passed through but never saw

I walked along the roadway to a fountain
Where lovers come to meet
A hobo walked up to me, I could tell
He didn't have enough to eat
He said, ""good sir you look so kind
And though the years have stripped me to the bone
It seems I am the better man
For in this place I've never walked alone

Will you be one who passed through but never saw
Never knowing never feeling anything
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do
Will you be one who passed through but never saw

""where will you be, my friendly, when your
Telephone ain't givin' out no calls
And when the seasons come to haunt you
Will you still find springtime in the fall
And when you're on your island
Will you wave at every ship that passes by
And will you feed a hungry man
I thank you, sir,
Now I'll just say goodbye""

Don't you be one who passed through but never saw
Never knowing never feeling anything
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do
Will you be one who passed through but never saw

Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do

But only the grass will grow once more

If people could look into each other's eyes
What a wonderful place this world would be
All strife would end, we could start again
And dreams like these must not pass on

But the brave keep falling to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

And the brave keep falling to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

The leaves of grass will not pass on
Though the millstones grind them into dust
For the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

Gordon Lightfoot,"Down the hall their voices ring, their feet are on the run
Phantoms on the winter sky, together they do come
Faded lips and eyes of blue, they're carried in the wind
Their laughter filled the countryside but they'll not laugh again

All the games are ended now, their voices have been stilled
Their fathers built the tools of war by which they all were killed
Their mothers made the uniforms, showing which side they were on
And the young boys were the middle men for the guns to prey upon

You've seen the fires in the night, watched the Devil as he smiles
You've heard a mother's mournful cry as she searches for her child
You've seen the lines of refugees, the faces of despair
And wondered at the wise men who never seem to care

Goodbye, you lost children, God speed you on your way
Your little beds are empty now, your toys are put away
Your mother sings a lullaby as she gazes at the floor
Your father builds more weapons and marches out once more

Down the hall their voices ring, their feet are on the run
Phantoms on the winter sky, together they do come
Faded lips and eyes of blue, they're carried in the wind
Their laughter filled the countryside but they'll not laugh again
",The Lost Children
Gordon Lightfoot,"Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses
Rainbows in the woodland, water to my knees
Shivering, quivering, the warm breath of spring
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

Catbirds and cornfields, daydreams together
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

Harsh nights and candlelights, woodfires a-blazin'
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses","Pussywillows, Cat-Tails"
Gordon Lightfoot,"Softly she comes
Whispers the breeze with her passing
In secret love she is laughing
Softly she comes in the night 

Softly she sighs
Sweetly she lies never sleeping
Her fragrance all in my keeping
Softly she comes in the night 

Down the darkened hall
I hear her footsteps on my stair
And she is in my arms once more 

Then softly she goes
Her shining lips in the shadows
Whisper goodbye at my window
Softly she goes in the dawn 

Down the darkened hall
I hear her footsteps on my stair
And she is in my arms once more 

Then softly she goes
Her shining lips in the shadows
Whisper goodbye at my window

Gordon Lightfoot,"If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender
You'll feel just fine but one thing's sure
You'll never be the same

If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender
Then you must be very sure
That life is not a game

You might even learn a thing or two approaching Lavender
You'll soon be on a one night tour
Forgetting your own name

You won't need a reason just to be alone with Lavender
For the light so warm and pure
Will draw you like a flame

The colors that surround you there will be the shade of Lavender
Shadows dancing everywhere
Like flowers in the rain

You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to Lavender
With words you never spoke before
And will not speak again

Oh sweet Lavender, I understand you perfectly
There is no way that I can see
You living by yourself

Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly
Your presence means so much to me
Much more that life itself

Oh sweet Lavender, as fragrant as the name you bear
Please cast away the clothes you wear
And give your love to me

Oh sweet Lavender, your smile is like the golden sun
I'd love to see you laugh and run
As naked as the sea

If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender
Don't try and get the best of her
She will not share the blame

If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender
Then you must be very sure
That life is not a game
There is no shame

Gordon Lightfoot,"It's alright for some but not alright for me
When the one that I'm lovin' slips around
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me, baby, can't you see
That I know how it is?

I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this

I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes

It's alright for some, but not alright to be
Where the one that I'm lovin' can't be found
The city where we live, might be quite large
But the circle is small, why not tell us all
And then all of us will know?

I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this

I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes

It's alright to leave, but not alright to lie
When you come home and you can't say where you've been
You think it's fine to do, things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me, baby, can't you see
That I know how it is?

I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Hard to forget, always in step with the world she's in

Never knowing, never feeling, showing so much pride
Never saying what she's thinking or feeling deep inside

Poor little Allison, dreaming of the right one
Laughing out loud, lost in a crowd of fair weather friends

Gordon Lightfoot,"I feel a little blue 'cause I can't sew
There's still a lot of things that I should know

Anyone can guess
I don't know how to press
My Saturday clothes
And everyone's goin' home

I feel a little sad to watch them leave
But I'll be cool because I don't believe

The happy times are gone
I can still put on
My Saturday clothes
Every warm body knows

I've got to tell you that was a swell time
Now I'll take the butts away
And put the glasses on the tray
I'll see you all next Saturday

I feel a little off because they're gone
And if my gal were here I'd still be on

But in a week or two
There's lots of things to do
In my Saturday clothes
And everyone's gone home

Gordon Lightfoot,"The perfume that she wore was from some little store
On the down side of town
But it lingered on long after she'd gone
I remember it well

And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night

Her long flowing hair came softly undone
And it lay all around
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side
In the warmth of her love

And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin
And we played a game only she could win
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget
Then left with the answer I've never found yet

""How long"", said she, ""Can a moment like this
Belong to someone?""
""What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die
We must almost be born""

So if you should ask me what secrets I hide
I'm only your lover, don't make me decide

On the down side of town

Gordon Lightfoot,"Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon
And the anchors have been weighed
From Miami to Nassau
She's bound across the waves

She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay
Into the open sea
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it

Now the many years she's been to sea
She's seen the better times
She gives a groan of protest
As they cast away her lines

And the grumble of her engines
And the rust along her spine
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'

But the sands run out within her heart
A tiny spark glows red
It smolders through the evening
There's laughter overhead

Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt
And the drinks are passed around
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'

Now it's midnight on the open sea
And the moon is shinin' bright
Some people join the party
And others say goodnight

There's many who are sleepin' now
It's been a busy day
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'

""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning
Let someone understand""
But her silent plea is wasted
In the playin' of the band

Everybody's dancin' on her deck
And they're havin' such a time
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""

Deep within the Yarmouth Castle
The fire begins to glow
It leaps into the hallways
And climbs and twists and grows

And the paint she wore to keep her young
Oh Lord, how well it burns
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'

Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast
The captain stands aloft
He calls up to the boatswain, says
""Boatswain, we are lost""

For the ragged hoses in the racks
No pressure do they hold
And the people down below will soon be dyin'

All amidships, oh she's blazin' now
It's spreadin' fore and aft
The people are a-scramblin'
As the fire blocks their path

The evil smoke surrounds them
And they're fallin' in their tracks
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'

Oh then the ship, Bahama Star
Comes steamin' through the night
She sees the Castle blazin'
And 'tis a terrible sight

""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries
""We'll save you if we can""
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'

""God help the ones who sleep below
And cannot find the way
Thank God for those we rescue
Upon this awful day""

Now the heroes, they are many
But the times are growin' slim
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'

Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'
She's cryin' like a child
You can hear her if you listen
Above the roar so wild

Is she cryin' for the ones who lie
Within her molten sides?
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'

But the livin' soon were rescued
The ones who lived to tell
From the Star they watched her
As she died there in the swells

Like a toy ship on a mill pond
She burned all through the night
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'

And the icy wind did blow
The water seeped into his shoes
And the drizzle turned to snow
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead
And the wine was runnin' low
And the old man came home
From the forest 

His tears fell on the sidewalk
As he stumbled in the street
A dozen faces stopped to stare
But no one stopped to speak
For his castle was a hallway
And the bottle was his friend
And the old man stumbled in
From the forest 

Up a dark and dingy staircase
The old man made his way
His ragged coat around him
As upon his cot he lay
And he wondered how it happened
That he ended up this way
Getting lost like a fool
In the forest 

And as he lay there sleeping
A vision did appear
Upon his mantle shining
A face of one so dear
Who had loved him in the springtime
Of a long-forgotten year
When the wildflowers did bloom
In the forest 

She touched his grizzled fingers
And she called him by his name
And then he heard the joyful sound
Of children at their games
In an old house on a hillside
In some forgotten town
Where the river runs down
From the forest 

With a mighty roar the big jets soar
Above the canyon streets
And the con men con but life goes on
For the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotten soldier
The dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home
From the forest",Home from the Forest
Gordon Lightfoot,"If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me

If I could speak with the tongues of the masters of old
If I could tame all the fleeting perceptions I hold
Would I stand in the marketplace before
To be shouted down without any warning at all, to be stood by the wall
And shot by the man in blue

If I could run with the grace of a sun-colored stallion
If I could fly like the great silver jets in the morning
If I caused the wind to change with one wave of my hand
And if I could play the final symphony and set it free
Would it mean anything to you

If I could stand like a rusty old man in his armor
If I could ride the steed that he rode in his time
I would turn his head away to the river
And let him wander through the meadow grass, wild and free
For everyone to see

If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me

Gordon Lightfoot,"The last time I saw her face, 
Her eyes were bathed in starlight 
And her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me, 
Her lips were like the scented flowers 
Inside a rain-drenched forest
But that was so long ago 
That I can scarcely feel 
The way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds, 
I would tear the threads away 
That I might bleed some more

The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that called to everyone
To love the ground she walked upon
Those were good day

The last time I held her hand, 
Her touch was autumn, spring and 
Summer, and winter too
The last time I let go of her, 
She walked a way into the night
I lost her in the misty streets, 
A thousand months, a thousand miles
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon, 
That's where she is

But that was so long ago 
That I can scarcely feel 
The way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds, 
I would tear the threads away

The last time I saw her face, 
Her eyes were bathed in starlight 
And she walked alone

The last time she kissed my cheek

Beneath a battered marking stone
It lies forgotten",The Last Time I Saw Her

From the factory to the farm
From the mine to the mill yard

While time slips away

Just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye
You'll see what I'm after
By the look in my eye

Just walk away and leave me alone
It's a long way back home

Now in case you should ask me
What it is that I've done
I'd say I'm a soldier
Who once had a son

But my son doesn't know me
That's his right to choose
Oh say, can you see? My best friend is me
I'm a friend I could use

Just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye

By the look in my eye

Just walk away and leave me alone

Now the pages have faded
The story grows cold
And the plot falls to ashes
Like the ruins of old

Those rats in my rafters
They're after my shoes
And anything else they can find on the shelf
I've said they could use

Sitting in a roadside diner

The big trucks rollin' by

That I miss her so, in north Ontario

Or north to Mendocino

And a soft southern flame
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name
She wakes me up when the sun goes down
And the wheels of love go 'round
Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round, love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go 'round

When the new day begins
I go down to the cotton gin
And I make my time worth while to them
Then I climb back up again
And she waits by the door
Oh Cotton Jenny I'm sore
And she rubs my feet while the sun goes down
And the wheels of love go 'round

Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round, love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go 'round

In the hot, sickly south
When they say we'll shut my mouth
I can never be free from the cotton grind
But I know I got what's mine
With a soft southern flame
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name
She wakes me up when the sun goes down
And the wheels of love go 'round

Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round, love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go 'round
Wheels go 'round
'Round and 'round, hmm",Cotton Jenny
Gordon Lightfoot,"Go my way and I'll be good to you
Go my way and your dreams will all come true
In the sunset the wild waves are callin'
My shadow is followin' you

Go my way and I'll take you by the hand
Believe in me and I'll do the best I can
I can't be anything but just what I am
I can't help it if I'm in love with you

Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend
My thoughts are on you, I dare not ask again

Go my way it's the only way to go
If things aren't workin' out, you'll be the first to know
Come on along and together well go
Please love me and say that you'll be mine

Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend
My thoughts are on you, I dare not ask again

Go my way it's the only way to go

Gordon Lightfoot,"Love and maple syrup goes together
Like the sticky winds of winter
When they meet
When lonely lovers come to rest
Beneath the trees they do their best
But still they can't be free

Looking for the world to be
Anything but what they see
Longing to be understood
By the heart that shapes the wood

If you go into the forest
Gaze up through the leaves
And see the sky is almost wild
You can learn to understand
What makes the forest greet the man
Like a mother's only child

In the north when when winter's claw
Relaxes now to keep the law
Of nature in control
People come and stand in line
To rob the forest of her wine
But they don't feel the cold

Looking for the world to be
Anything but what they see
Longing to be understood
By the heart that shapes the wood

Love and maple syrup shine like
Like embers warm, like thoughts divine
They tell us it is spring
Love and maple syrup stir
The thoughts of people into words
Of songs that they can sing

Love and maple syrup goes together
Like the sticky winds of winter
When they meet
When lonely lovers come to rest
Beneath the trees they do their best
But still they can't be free

Looking for the world to be
Anything but what they see
Longing to be understood
By the heart that shapes the wood

Looking for the world to be
Anything but what they see
Longing to be understood
By the heart that shapes the wood

Gordon Lightfoot,"Never had much to say, he traveled alone with no friends
Like a shadowy ghost at dawn he came and he went
Through the woodland swiftly gliding, to the young maid he came gliding
Where she'd run to meet him, by the garden wall

Oh my sweet Miguel, I will never tell
No one will ever know, what I know too well
And he'd smile and lay his head on her breast and he'd say I have no fear
They're waiting for me to cross the border, to swim the river

'Cause I've done that before
To see my true loves smiling face
A hundred times or more
Oh my sweet Miguel she cried
I'll love you till I die

He was born to the south in Mexico they say
The child of a man who had soon gone away
But his mother loved him dearly and she would take him yearly
To the great Cathedral in St. Augustine

Oh my young Miguel, listen to the bell
Of my poverty you must never tell
And he cried himself to sleep in the night
And he vowed to make things right
So he took the gun down from the wall and he paid a call

He knew she'd understand
A lawman came to capture him
The gun jumped in his hand
Oh Miguel the mother cried
You must run son or you'll die

So the story is told of his true love cross the line
As strong as the oak and as sweet as the vine
And the child she bore him, came on the fateful mornin'
When they sent him to his final rest

Oh my sweet Miguel listen to the bell
No one will ever know, of what I know too well
Then she'd smile and lay the child on her breast
And she'd say I have no fear
I'm waiting for you to cross the border, to swim the river

'Cause you've done that before
To see your true loves smiling face
A hundred times or more
Oh my sweet Miguel she cried
I'll love you till I die

Gordon Lightfoot,"We've got to stay together
We've got to find each other now
That is how we can learn all about the other man's song
On the plains of abraham
When they sent the lamb to die
You and I were asleep in the rock of ages
Remember the unborn children still to come
If you need me and I need you
There's nothin' else needs sayin'
Understand it
I'm not too deaf to hear the song you're playin'

Nous vivons ensemble
Nous nous connaissons maintenant
Voici comment nous pouvons decouvrir une autre humanite
Sur les plaines d'abraham
Lors do dernier sacrifice
Toi et moi nous dormions tres loin dans le temp
Souviens toi des enfants qui attendant encore

Si tu me veux je serai la see'est tout ce que j'ai a dire

Gordon Lightfoot,"I climbed the Redwood Hill
'Twas on a rainy day
To rise above the throng
And talk with Mother Nature for a while

She told me of her love
For the children in her trust
And of her grave concern
For the likes of you and me and us

Crying though she was
She did speak these tender words
The things that I am
I could not change for any man

I tried to comfort her
Ah, but she would not be still
And how the rain did fall
As I found my way back down the Redwood Hill

Crying though she was
She did speak these tender words
The things that I am
I would not change for any man

I tried to comfort her
Ah, but she would not be still
I'll not forget that day
When Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill

I'll not forget that day

Just dropped in to say hello
It's that same old lover man
Baby you lost so long ago

'Cause I was born to believe
I never could deceive, believe me

I hear no children's voices
Have they gone back to school
And the same old lover man
Is still acting like a fool, baby

I guess I was born to believe
I never could deceive, believe me

It's cold outside your window
Please let me in, the night is wild

Not some lonesome winsome child

Gordon Lightfoot,"He came down through fields of green
On the summer side of life
His love was ripe

There was no illusions
On the summer side of life
Only tenderness

And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why he would cry
The whole day long

There was young girls everywhere
On the summer side of life
They talked all night

To the young men that they knew
On the summer side of life
Goin' off to fight

And if you saw them now
You'd wonder why they would cry
The whole day long

He came down through fields of green
On the summer side of life
He prayed all night

Then he walked into a house
Where love had been misplaced
His chance to waste

And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why he would cry
The whole day long

And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why
And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why
And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why",Summer Side of Life

I heard you talking in your sleep
Is there anything that I can do
I don't believe we've had a word all day
Bout anything at all

I heard you talking in the night
That's right, yes I heard ya call
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke
It's a name I don't recall
I heard you softly whisper
I reached out to hold you near me
Then from your lips there came that secret
I was not supposed to know

Of the little girls and boys, they remind me of a child
That I knew and a big harvest moon
That shon' by suppertime in the dusty afternoon

When the autumn wind goes whistlin' through the trestle we would climb
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time

Born in the country and I like that country song
We played for just a nickel every time we got to town
And I bought you a dime diamond ring
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings

And I need to be there
When the world gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time

Born in the country and I like that country way
Of the uncles and the cousins and the card games they would play
While the young ones slept overhead
Beneath the quilts that mother made, when all the prayers were said

When the autumn wind goes whistlin' through the trestle we would climb

Inside that picture frame
Of lace

So ill at ease
From sleep that will not come

Through a storm and finally reached a quiet shore
The homeless found a home on Susan's floor 

Didn't feel so cold and tired
Stretched out before her fire
Rollin' smokes and drinkin' up her wine
And I remember candlelight
And singing 'til we could not sing no more
Then fallin' warm asleep on Susan's floor 

Well now that my song is sweeeter
I think I'd like to greet her
And thank her for the favors that she gave
A stranger I came
My head bowed in the rain to her door
I sat and sang my songs on Susan's floor 

In the mornin' I'd go on
Buyin' kingdoms with my songs
Knowin' I'd be back in just a while
Warm in the sunlight of her smile

Well lots of time and songs have passed
I catch myself just looking back
Reliving all the wonder of those nights
That's where I'd be today
If I had only stayed one night more

Gordon Lightfoot,"The songs of the wars are as old as the hills
They cling like the rust on the cold steel that kills
They tell of the boys who went down to the tracks
In a patriotic manner with the cold steel on their backs

The patriot's dream is as old as the sky
It lives in the lust of a cold callous lie
Let's drink to the men who got caught by the chill
Of the patriotic fever and the cold steel that kills

The train pulled away on that glorious night
The drummer got drunk and the bugler got tight
While the boys in the back sang a song of good cheer
While riding off to glory in the spring of their years

The patriot's dream still lives on today
It makes mothers weep and it makes lovers pray
Let's drink to the men who got caught by the chill
Of the patriotic fever and the cold steel that kills

Well there was a sad, sad lady, weeping all night long
She received a sad, sad message from a voice on the telephone
Her children were all sleeping as she waited out the dawn
How could she tell those children that their father was shot down
So she took them to her side that day and she told them one by one
Your father was a good man ten thousand miles from home
He tried to do his duty and it took him straight to hell
He might be in some prison, I hope he's treated well

Well there was a young girl watching in the early afternoon
When she heard the name of someone who said he'd be home soon
And she wondered how they got him, but the papers did not tell
There would be no sweet reunion, there would be no wedding bells
So she took herself into her room and she turned the bed sheets down
And she cried into the silken folds of her new wedding gown
He tried to do his duty and it took him straight to hell
He might be in some prison, I hope he's treated well

Well there was an old man sitting in his mansion on the hill
And he thought of his good fortune and the time he'd yet o kill
Well he called to his wife one day, ""Come sit with me awhile""
Then turning toward the sunset, he smiled a wicked smile
""Well I'd like to say I'm sorry for the sinful deeds I've done
But let me first remind you, I'm a patriotic son""

And if I don't stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone
I'll be reachin' for the bottle, Lord, before this day is done

I'm on my second cup of coffee, I still can't face the day
The room was filled with laughs as we danced the night away
But my sleep was filled with dreaming of the wrongs that I had done

I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me

It took most of my time to do what never was done
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you

I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price
Well, ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free?

What did ya do when the rain began to fall
How did it feel when I looked through your soul
When was the last time you wanted my love
How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep
Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden
How could you put yourself through like you did
I'm not the kind that would hold you that way

Drop me a line if ya wake up feelin' bad
I'm still a friend and I'd like to hear from you
Where does it say love should last forever

Around the town where I was born
New York seems so far away
Though I was there just yesterday

I have played on my guitar
In coffeehouses, hall and bars
Everyone that I call friend
Knows they will not be forgot

Trains and planes and rented cars
Singers, saints and other starts
I suspect them every one
They'll never change, it's too much fun

Just for now I'd like to rest
In the shade of a maple tree
To the blue Canadian sky
I'll say a prayer for the world out there

When I stand on my own sod
It feels so good to be home, by God
The winter wind has turned my head
But I always came up warm somehow

Bottles, beads and cigarettes
And lovers that I ain't found yet
Pickin' with a friend till dawn
And singing all of those hi'way songs

Just for now I'd like to rest
In the shade of a maple tree
To the blue Canadian sky
I'll say a prayer for the world out there

When I walk the hill so high
Around the town where I was born
New York seems so far away
Though I was there just yesterday

I would travel all my life
If loneliness was not the price
While headin' north across that line's
The only time I'm flyin'

No need to get bothered, I'll think about Monday
When Monday comes, it's two for one

Another lazy mornin', I took time to make town 'n stock a pint or two
The most delicious brew
Keepin' up with the joneses, I hope no one telephones us
I'd take a place in the country, but for now the old back yard
Looks to me like fifty acres of the roundest ground in town

Another lazy mornin', come supper time I'm gonna light my barbecue
Nothin' new, only that she loves me
And nothin' I know can change me, no need to get bothered
I do more livin' than it might seem
Some dream, livin' like a pauper, bless my darlin' daughter

I'd like to know what makes a man go, over land and sea

Waits for me beside the kitchen door
She is my light
In this place where the darkness never ends
She'll guide me where the tunnels twist and bend
She's the only one who listens when I tell her
I got less than I can spend

Was away the coal dust from my face

When the night shift's done
She'll be waiting by the table when I come
Searchin' for another dream to chase

When we'll be movin' on

The promise that I made to carry on

Sometimes I smile
In the cage where the cables softly hum
I'd curse that old straw boss to the bone
But the mother of a miner's child
Is waiting for her paycheck to come home
Come Saturday
And he is just a miner's boy

Early each day upon rising
I think of my lost love from over the sea
And sometimes I've wondered, if she thinks of me

I long to recall every kiss, every kind word
I miss her so much I could die
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart

There's peace in the garden, there's peace in the air
Peace in the sound of the river
There's peace in the meadow, the sun shines like gold
And if she were with me there'd be peace in my soul

I long to return to the place I remember
The taste of her lips close to mine
I could do much better if I could be strong
Come into my garden but leave me alone

I come to this garden, I come here to rest
Just as the night comes stealing
Someone is weeping, I'm calling her name
Deep in the garden, deep in my brain

I long to recall every kiss, every kind word

Gordon Lightfoot,"Out on the road like a low-down Joe
And the bar where we are is so cool I'd like to stay
Misunderstood like I knew I would be
The one I care for don't mind, she's built that way
I would gladly offer you my love
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.

This rental car never went so far
But with each passing mile on more dream has turned to clay
Now that we've met and your eyes are all wet
Let me fetch my guitar, there's a song I'd like to play
I would gladly offer you my song
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.

If you got some to spend,we'll do anything you say

When I heard the teacher say
Patiently, one and two make three
We were children, you and me
Let us pray for the ones they call
The children of today

Nothin' left but promises
Nothin' much is certain
All we see is want and need across the board, 
Why thank you lord
We're livin' in the glory of your care
Skies of blue have all turned brown
To the sound of cryin

Of broken dreams

It's too late for prayin'

See the ocean wild and blue
Think of all that's in her
She will not surrender to the likes of us, 
But then she must
They tell us, wise men tell us, it's too late
For each child with eyes that smile
There'll be ten more cryin'
Lord abide, let us stem the time
Of helplessness
But then I guess we're livin'
Is it too late for prayin'

Nothin' here but grains of sand
Nothin' much worth savin'
Guess we've all got problems of our own to bear,
And still we share
Tomorrow could get better than today

If I give you a rose, buddy
Would you please bury it in the fields?

Watchin' it all fold out

There's a train down at the station
It's come to carry my bones away
Two engines on
Twenty-one coaches long
End to end

A son of the sea am I""

If you live to follow the golden sun
You better beware
Knowin' the watchman's always there

If you find me feedin' daisies
Please turn my face up to the sky
And leave me be
Watchin' the moon roll by
Whatever I was
You know it was all because
I've been on the town

Gordon Lightfoot,"Bells of the evening, O sing to my love
Tell her I miss her, my own turtledove
The streets of the old town are covered with rain
I think I might never know true love again

I'm lost with no road signs to guide me
A slave to my whisky and dreams
Bells of the evening, O bells that I love
I've got some feelings I long to be rid of

I'm not one to ramble; I'm not one to boast
Though I had one lover more lovely than most
She was a country girl born to be free
Who took to the city by chance there to find me

Bells of the evening go pealin'
I'm down here listenin' to you
Bells of the evening, O bells of the sea
Tell her that I love her, that I'm lost and so lonely

Bells of the evening, your sweet Sunday sound
Reminds me of the redwoods and moss covered ground
So if I should wander on back to the coast
Tell her to remember it's her I need the most

I'm caught by the minstrel's misfortune
Of being forever displaced
Bells of the evening, O bells of the sea
Tell her that I love her; That I'm lost I'm so lonely",Bells of the Evening

To make me want to leave this place
Still I keep coming back for more of 
The same to fan the dying flame
Here inside these walls that seem 
To move a little closer every day
There must be a way out of 
This crazy game we play out to the end
Let us just pretend a while
Think about the good things now and then

I think this time that was the best time 
That we two had ever known
We tried the handle of the house 
Upon the shore and found the open door
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam 
Doing dances on the floor
We were only playing like two children 
Who had stayed away from school
Two of us could not be wrong
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule

I think this time we've learned enough 
To know that nothing is the same
But still the pounding of my heart 
Hasn't changed and leavin's so strange
Here among my thoughts of you 
I find a gentle longing to be free
There must be a way out of 
This crazy game we play out to the end
Take away the in-between
Think about the good things now and then
We will see the day when you 
Or I will stay or face up to the end

And think about the good things now and then",Now and Then
Gordon Lightfoot,"In the name of love she came
This foolish winsome girl
She was all decked out like a rainbow trout
Swimmin' up stream in the world
And she said ""Please, please, I've lost my way
The current is too strong
In the name of love, kind sir I pray, 
In the name of love""

So I took her by the hand, 
She took me by the will
She was all dolled up like a blue eyed pup
Looking for something to spill
And she said ""Please, please, I've lost my way

In the name of love, kind sir I pray,

Rainy day people don't talk
They just listen till they've heard it all

If you get lonely, all you really need is that rainy day love
Rainy day people all know there's no sorrow
They can't rise above
Rainy day lovers don't love any others
That would not be kind

And the road becomes what's left

We went to the mill on the edge of the town
She wore white, I wore black

The soul is the rock and 
The rock will not be harmed
Though man must be cheated 
Just as women must be charmed
And the mind is the light 
For the heart which cannot see
The soul becomes the stranger 
But the rock will always be

Gordon Lightfoot,"I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write
But songs of love will never leave love's feelings undefiled
The tide has turned, the waves roll in, the waters fill my eyes

The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand
The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands
If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be
But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free

The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come
I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone
My role is played, the demon dogs come stealin' o'er land
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand

How you could be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me

And I know that I won't ever change
We've been friends through rain or shine
For such a long, long time

Laughing eyes and smiling face
It seems so lucky just to have the right
Of telling you with all my might
You're beautiful tonight

And I know that you won't ever stray
'Cause you've been that way from day to day

How could life be anything but beautiful

And you were made for me

And I know that I won't ever change

Gordon Lightfoot,"Through the woodland, through the valley
Comes a horseman wild and free
Tilting at the windmills passing
Who can the brave young horseman be
He is wild but he is mellow
He is strong but he is weak
He is cruel but he is gentle
He is wise but he is meek

Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a battered book into his hand
Standing like a prophet bold
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Till he can shout no more

I have come o'er moor and mountain
Like the hawk upon the wing
I was once a shining knight
Who was the guardian of a king
I have searched the whole world over
Looking for a place to sleep
I have seen the strong survive
And I have seen the lean grown weak

See the children of the earth
Who wake to find the table bare
See the gentry in the country
Riding off to take the air

Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a rusty sword into his hand
Then striking up a knightly pose
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Till he can shout no more

See the jailor with his key
Who locks away all trace of sin
See the judge upon the bench
Who tries the case as best he can
See the wise and wicked ones
Who feed upon life's sacred fire
See the soldier with his gun
Who must be dead to be admired

See the man who tips the needle
See the man who buys and sells
See the man who puts the collar
On the ones who dare not tell
See the drunkard in the tavern
Stemming gold to make ends meet
See the youth in ghetto black
Condemned to life upon the street

Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a tarnished cross into his hand
Then standing like a preacher now
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Then in a blaze of tangled hooves
He gallops off across the dusty plain
In vain to search again
Where no one will hear

Through the woodland, through the valley
Comes a horseman wild and free
Tilting at the windmills passing
Who can the brave young horseman be
He is wild but he is mellow
He is strong but he is weak
He is cruel but he is gentle
He is wise but he is meek",Don Quixote

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Running over the same old ground

It was there she wandered
With her suitcase in her hand
Her fate she pondered

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there
And the band was groovin'

When he gave a glance
That said how much he would like to meet her
How was she to know at the time
He would mistreat her

In her case she danced for him
Although a hundred eyes were turned her way
And before the set was through
He knew she would be his loved one

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere

He's playin' up in Michigan with a group
They call The Intended
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone
The song was ended

But as she walks, she waits for him
The pavement is a shoulder for her tears
But in her heart she knows there is no way
She can hope to change him

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
A go-go girl in love

And by the way, did she mention my name

Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way, did she mention my name

Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high, did the look in her eye seem far away
Is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain

To the night and the empty skies my love
To the night and the empty skies 

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth turn in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command my love
That was there at my command 

The first time ever I lay with you
And felt your heart beat close to mine
I thought our joy would fill the earth
And would last 'till the end of time my love
And would last 'till the end of time 

The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave

Gordon Lightfoot,"That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Ev'ry thing you had is gone
As you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me

I ain't the kind to hang around
With any new love that I found
'Cause movin' is my stock in trade
I'm movin' on
I won't think of you when I'm gone

So don't you shed a tear for me
'Cause I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I got a hundred more like you
So don't be blue
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through

Now there you go you're cryin' again
Now there you go you're cryin' again
But then someday when your poor heart
Is on the mend
I just might pass this way again

I want to hear it from someone who knows how it is

I want to hear it from you 

I want to hear it again
I want to know if the soft scented touch of your lips
Must be taken away like a mother's first kiss to the life that she gives 

I've got a right to get it straight from you
To give my life a different point of view 
To find a way to keep from losing you 

If you don't know what to say
To understand is my life and the question is why 
You should cry in the night while your eyes look away
Every time that I speak and there's nothing to say

Among its boughs you'll find her nesting

Her wings will grow your love will too

Something inside of me told me 
This would be my day 
I heard the morning train, 
I felt the wind change, 
Too many times I'm on my way

Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain

And then I saw the sunrise above the cotton sky like a candycane delight
I saw the milkman, I saw the business man, I saw the only road in sight
Then I got to thinkin' what makes you want to go, to know the wherefore 
and the why
So many times now, oh Lord I can't remember if it's September or July

Then all at once it came to me, I saw the wherefore, and you can see it if you try
It's in the sun above, it's in the one you love, you'll never know the reason why

Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain
So much to lose, so much to gain",Wherefor and Why

He was known to be know man's fool

The one man band was a mighty good man
Cause he played 'til the break of dawn
He ups and downs about four more rounds
And he stayed 'til the crowd went home

To the sound of a thousand guns
Who'd storm the gates of hell itself
To the tune of a single drum?

Whose loves were lost at sea
In the hills of France and on German soil
From Saigon to Wounded Knee?

Who come from long lines of soldiers
Whose duty was fulfilled
In the words of a warrior's will
And protocol

Where are the boys in their coats of blue
Who flew when their eyes were blind?
Was God in town for the Roman games
Was he there when the deals were signed?

Who are the kings in their coats of mail
Who road by the cross to die?
Did they all go down into worthiness?
Is it wrong for a king to cry?
And who are these ones who would have us now
Whose presence in concealed
Whose nature is revealed
In a time bomb?

Who travel after whale

Gordon Lightfoot,"The space shuttle ends where the subway begins
There's a tear on the face of the moon
Fromdusk until dawn they have searched all day long
But there's too many clues in this room
At best it is said we've been locked deep inside
Of an old sea man's chest full of charts
Where maps are contained and what's left of his brains
When his crew threw his balls to the sharks

All around the looking glass
Dancing to a tune
Sweeping out the house with a fine tooth comb
Which history's shown
Leads to ruin

In a word it is said that at times we must fall
But the worst of it all was the lies
We died for the cause just like regular outlaws
In the dust of an old lawman's eyes
In times best forgot there was peace there was not
In her pains mother earth came to bloom
Her children were born in the eye of the storm
And there's too many clues in this room

The power that is stored in the no man's land of chance
Is the someone who knows what they're doin'

Remember a price must be paid
Be always too soon, be never too fast
At the time when all bets must be laid
Beware of the darkness, be kind to your children
Remember the woman who waits
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate

When you're caught by the gale and you're full under sail
Beware of the dangers below
And the song that you sing should not be too sad
And be sure not to sing it too slow
Be calm in the face of all common disgraces
And know what they're doin' it for
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door

When you're out on the road and feelin' quite lost
Consider the burden of fame
And he who is wise will not criticize
When other men fail at the game
Beware of strange faces and dark dingy places
Be careful while bending the law
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door

When you're down in the dumps and not ready to deal
Decide what it is that you need
Is it money or love, is it learnin' to live
Or is it the mouth you must feed
Be known as a man who will always be candid
On questions that do not relate
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate
And the house you live in will never fall down
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate",The House You Live In

Hi, derry day in the month of May
Was the song the minstrel sang
To the good of Robin Hood

And his suit was the shade of evergreen
The folks he knew, hadn't naught to fear
When the sheriff was there, they were over here

Hi, derry doon in the month of June
Was the song the minstrel sung
To the good of Robin Hood's
Good name and a place to run

He loved strong ale and a run down jail
Was the kind of a scene where he never failed
There was no man on the sea or land
Who could get Maid Marion on the trail

When she told him that he should go to school.
Well He'd stay away in the afternoon, take a little walk and pretty soon
You'd find him at the local auction barn.
Well, he'd stand and listen carefully until at last he began to see
How the auctioneer could talk so rapidly,
Well, he said ""Oh my, it's do or die, I've got to learn that auction cry,

He practiced calling bids both night and day
Till his pappy found him behind the barn just working up an awful storm
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer.
And his pop said ""Son, we just can't stand to have a mediocre man
Selling things at auction using our good name.
Gonna send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
And you can take your place among the best.""

He come back home a full fledged auctioneer.
And the people would come from miles around
Just to hear him make that rhythmic sound
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer.
And his fame spread out from shore to shore, he'd all that he could do and more,
He had to buy a plane to get around.

You ain't got no axe to grind

Rock of Ages tell me where does it stand
Are we bound for the promised land
Bless my soul, I ain't ready to die
And my future is in your hands

Mister Rock of Ages you've been goin' on strong
Since time began, til time is done
And so the tide shall run

Mister Rock of Ages tell me what do you see
Are we bound for eternity
Bless my soul, baby you're doin' fine
You ain't got no axe to grind

Rock of Ages you've got nothing to hide
Got no ego, got no pride
Bless my soul, let me do what I can
For my future is in your hands

Mister Rock of Ages, the lord of my lease
In times of toil and times of peace
Until my song shall cease

Mister Rock of Ages, I'm a part of you now
I am yours, you belong to be
Bless my soul, let me do what I can
For my future is in your hands",Mister Rock of Ages
Gordon Lightfoot,"Was it someone she met that's so hard to forget
Was it some kind of an ocean of changes
I don't remember where she said she would be
And since I don't know, let me guess 
Was it somewhere in Michigan or the Lake of the Woods
Up in old Montreal or Toronto the good
Somewhere in Reno or somewhere in Rome
And when all is said and done
Will she leave me alone 

I don't want to get so low
And as for my sadness, it comes and it goes
I don't remember where she said she would be
Back in the city or on the high seas 

Was it up in Hornpayne where the trains run on time
Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind
North of the border or down in South Bend
And when all is said and done
Is there no rainbow's end 

I don't want to own the key
To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free
I don't remember where she said she would go
Straight for the highway or down the low road
I don't remember where she said she would be
Back in the city or on the high seas",On the High Seas
Gordon Lightfoot,"I live in the light of the bright silver moon
I'll take you off sailing from midnight till noon
I'll show the Sea of Tranquility
You can have any flavor you happen see

I live in the shade of a forest of green
In the wildest of woodlands that you've ever seen
There's rabbits and quail and tender young snails
As brown as the seaweed on old rusty nails

There's fireflies dancing in the cool evening breeze
There's love and romancin' as nice as you please
There's otters and frogs and spotted ground hogs
And wiley old weasels in rotted out logs

There's rivers of rainbow and grey mountain trout
And little dark holes where the varmints hang out
There's foxes and hares in traps and in snares
And lots of bald eagles so you'd better take care

So if you've got the time and you'd like to pass by
Come down around midnight and give us a try
We'll show you the Sea of Tranquility
You can have any flavor you happen to see",Sea of Tranquility

Gordon Lightfoot,"All I'm after is to be on your winning side
All I need is to be turning back the tide
'Cause I care too much for the life that I lead
What you're thinking could be anybody's guess

All I'm after is the sun and the summer nights
By the seashore, don't want no more neon lights
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by
Ain't it funny, how the world seems to be back there in my dreams
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways
Ain't it funny, life feels different every day

All I'm after is to be the flame in your tattoo
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through
This is just a guess but I must confess
It feels better being certain
Please excuse my truthfulness
What I'm seeing's worth believing
When you thrill me like you do
So you wonder why my feelings never fade
I think I got it made

In the evening when the rain begins to fall
That's when I wonder if you think of me at all
But you sound so sad, in your special way
Ain't it funny, life feels different with each new passing day

I'm bent but not broken, all I need is some rest
And a bottle of your very best
Blackberry wine

There's a new moon risin' and 
The wind sings its old song
Pass it on over it's a sin to be sober too long
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is my share
Of a bottle of that very rare

My old gal's got a new dress on five and dime
Try as she will she can't get me 
To come home on time

Gordon Lightfoot,"In this land of chance do we know right from wrong
Even at a glance we know the road is long
We don't owe a single thing to anyone

Most of us do not believe in come what may
Everything we fought for was in vain they say
Even when called upon to throw our lives away

We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories

In these times of trial and uncertainty
I have thought what does this freedom mean to me
Is it just some long forgotten fantasy

Our love for each other may not be explained
We live in a world where tears must fall like rain
Most of us don't wish to cause each other pain

We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories

To every unsung hero in the universe
To those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth
To all good men of reason may they never thirst

We have wings to guide us through the timeless sea
And faith that will remain through all eternity
We try to be helpful to the ones in need

Held for ransom if you please

Gordon Lightfoot,"Down in the warm dark part of my heart you stay
I've been on my own for so long as I stand here today
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say

I've been around some walking on the down the street
Feeling as low as the shoes on the soles of my feet
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway

Many's the time I've wished that I were free
But my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say

Whenever the thought seems better off left alone
I think of you then in a way that is ten times as strong
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway

I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say

Though it might grieve me, I'll do anything that you say
Please understand me, I'll do anything that you say

I have loved and I have lost
Ever after I will be remembered
In my fashion, in my way

There have been times, I have seen the reaper
In the bad times, and in the good
I have bent down, I have touched the ground
Saying prayers and touching wood

In my fashion, I have been a father
I have loved and been loved in return
>From the ashes, I have kept the home fires
Burning after all was said and done

Now take a look at me
Do I look like the kind of guy
The kinda fool who went to school 
And had to stand on a stool
Because he couldn't come t' terms with a slide rule
Take a look around again

Gordon Lightfoot,"Ah, the living ain't easy 
With all of these false emotions 
Too little devotion and I'm tired of just 
Being alone, she's not the same 
She's a son of a gun, she's a red hot flame 
She lights the sun and conjures up the rain 

Like any good gambler 
I was chained to a wishing well 
I keep wishing in vain, but listen friend 
Don't look now, she's right behind you 
Looking for someone to take her inside 
It thrills her so, it's a rainbow ride 

I'm a little uneasy 
And there ain't much pride inside me 
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you 
It's too late now, she's not the same 
She's a red hot kid, she's a crying shame 

Anytime is the right time 
To get on with a new tomorrow 
But I could never let yesterday go 
And when the falling rain makes me sad 
She comes to me in the dreams I've had 
In the morning light, in the dead of night 

Ah, the loving ain't easy 
I let it get the best of me 
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you 
It's too late now, she don't talk no more 
She don't make me feel like she did before 
There's too much wait and too much give and take

Gordon Lightfoot,"Thank you for the promises we make
I know I can't complain
I think I did all right
No failures are in sight
Only now and then
I'd like to reminisce
Do you remember when

Even if we're angels we can't ask 
To wander through the past
The future is our goal
The night is black as coal
If I could pay the price
I'd like to love you once
I'd love to love you twice

We cannot say enough
The road is sometimes rough
But we can get along
The going will get tough 
But we won't be afraid 
Of the promises we made

Thank you for the promises you keep
When I am fast asleep
To be where we belong
Is all that I can ask
We can do it in the shade
As long as I have you
And the promises we made

Thank you for the promises we break
If you made a clean mistake
Well that's what love's about
No need to stand and shout
The truth is in your eyes
The answer lies within
No need to criticize

Thanks 
For the promises at hand
The abuse that we must stand
Is often heaven sent
They may not pay the rent
You never can be sure
When promises get bent

Forever in my mind 
To leave the past behind
And seal it with a kiss
Forever in my soul
I will remember this",Thank You for the Promises
Gordon Lightfoot,"I'd like to be in biscuit city
With my banjo in my hand
I don't need no long vacation
In some foreign land
Cause the sound of my own breathing
Has been turning to a sigh
I wish that I could make the time
To be in biscuit city by and by
Oh the water is of emerald
And the beach is white as snow
And everyone's got money
And no place to go
In a land of milk and honey
It can really make you smile
And if I had a ticket
I would stay in biscuit city for a while

All the girls are in bikinis
All the boys are in the buff
With the baby in between and
That makes three of us
And the streets are all so quiet
And the walls are squeaky clean
I think you ain't been nowhere 'til
The town of biscuit city you have seen

I'd rather be in biscuit city
With my banjo in my hand
Than take a big vacation
In some foreign land
Cause the sound of my own breathing
Has been turning to a sigh

I would be in biscuit city by and by
If it were not for misfortune
I would stay in biscuit city 'til I die

Gordon Lightfoot,"I'm on my way, got no time to waste
Places to go, people to chase
Gonna grab my comb 'n' my toothpaste
Gotta get away from here

Twenty-one years from the day I was born
I was workin' on the night shift, tootin' my horn
Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm
You come to me

You were the girls with the summer sunshine
In your eyes and in your smile
You were the one I thought, I thought loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here

I'm a real bad loser, that's what I am
Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram
You can stick my money in an old tin can
I think I fell in love again

I was down by the bus stop, bidin' my time
I was hitchin' a ride with a friend of mine
I was almost gone, I was over the line
I said what's come over me

You were the girl with the sound of springtime
In your songs and in your voice
You were the one I thought, loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you

I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes
Been awake so long, I'm getting ready to doze

Gordon Lightfoot,"She's my knotty pine
She leans with the wind
She cries turpentine
Sometimes she nettles me
But I don't mind
Only now and then
When her branches lean beneath the snow
She's knotty but nice
Reaching for the sky
She don't like snow 'n ice
To leave things as they stand
Is my advice
She's been good to me
So I tend to go there when I can

She's my knotty pine
Such a pretty scene
She tries to be kind
She gives birds a home
And shelters them
In her coat of green
She's as green as evergreen can be

She's a real delight
When little breezes call
To ruffle up her skin
All her sap runs free
And sticks to me
Hidden deep within
I will be her slave eternally

She crys turpentine
Sometimes she nettles me

So other than nothin' what's new
The water's still flowin' through the rose on my skin
This here tattoo is for you

The boys at the parlor downtown
Didn't waste anytime a-puttin' it down
Time has been wastin' away I can see it

Go sailin' on by as it slips through my fingers
The bow and the wave never wait for tomorrow
They just keep on rollin' as straight as an arrow, good night

Girl of my dreams you get better each day
I wish I could see you somehow
Girls that I love is there no other way
This here tattoo is for now

I'd been out drinkin' all day
I got carried away at the parlor last night
This summer rose is for you it's no wonder

I bothered to wander back into the parlor
It's red and in bloom and it's more than one color
It lives on forever for just a few dollars, good night

Whatever you think of me I'm still your friend
So baby whatever you do
Now that it's taken its permanent home
This here tattoo is for you

The boys at the parlor downtown
Didn't waste any time a-puttin' it down
Time has been wastin' away, you know time doesn't

Wait for nobody to find what they're after
It just keeps on rolling on down the deep canyons
And through the green meadows into the broad ocean, good night

Gordon Lightfoot,"Whispers of the north
Soon I will go forth
To that wild and barren land
Where nature takes it's course
Whispers of the wind
Soon I will be there again
Bound with a wild and restless drive
That pulls me from within
And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away

Whispers of the north
Soon I will return again
To those endless afternoons
In sunshine and in rain
Whispers of my love
Days and weeks on end
I will share my thoughts of her
In prayers that I will send

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away

Whispers of the north
The river and the shore
In the land that tested eskimos
Ten thousand years before
Whispers of my heart
In the tracks of animals
I will leave my footprints there
To lie beneath the snow

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away

Whispers of the wind
I will feel it sting
I will see it rise and fall
I will hear it sing
The sound is like a song to me
It takes away the pain
The river is the melody
And sky is the refrain

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away

But this was such a grim surprise
If I wait for the sun to shine

Without you, without you

If I can break the spell that is in me
Any fool would know where to go
I guess I'd better send a mayday
If I find me a rainbow's end

How will I find it then
Without you, without you, without you

Wait 'til I see you next time
Maybe I'll lose my mind
Livin' without you

If I can last, wait until the wind dies
I've been all up and down like a clown
And this is such a thin disguise
If I wait for the sun to shine

In my time and in each line I've ever sung
And in my life
Was it my imagination or are you still the one
Who lingers on

I'd do anything for you
You'd do anything for me
We'd do anything for love

Ohh, you'd use any means
And I would try any scheme for love
We'd do anything for love

Once or twice
In my loneliness I watched the world go by
There was I
One too many miles beyond where you might say
Some luck was due, after all

We could have touched the sky
You had no alibi because
We'd do anything for love

Ohh, I would try any means
To have you in all my dreams because
You'd do anything for love

Not long ago as I remember
Once upon a dark and windy day
When love looked like a dying ember
Before you came to call
The beauty of it all, I though I'd lost and yet

'Cause in my life
There in my mind in it now shines
A guiding light
Never again will I lose my way

Ohh, I would not tell a lie and
You had no alibi because
We'd do anything for love

Ohh, you'd use any means
And I would try any scheme for love
Simply anything for love

Ohh, I would do anything

Gordon Lightfoot,"Put me somewhere east of midnight
West of the turnpike
Anywhere I wander
Is where I'll take my rest

As I lie down, toss some thoughts around
Dreams I'm told will come true if you
Believe in those who love you right now

Sea of dreams I long for you
Forget about the others
This is my hike, you can come if you like
To feel good, I would help you if I could

But I am out here searching
For the things that might have been
I need no more reminders
Not one love letter have I seen

And that's a pretty good start
The ocean is where lovers meet again
Sea of dreams by all means
Float me out of danger until then
Forever amen

It's a long, long hike
We'll be leavin' early travelin' light
That's alright heaven will be ours tonight

The road is paved with moonbeams
There are faces that I knew
They all came back to haunt me
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you

It takes a bit of my heart
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore
Sea of dreams from now on

Forget about all the others
Back where the line forms
Destination sea of storms
By all means ever onward sea of dreams

Put me somewhere east of midnight
Along about daylight
Anywhere I wander
Is where I'll take my rest

If we could just lie down, love
Toss some thoughts around
It's a tough and a dirty long hike
You can come if you like

If we could just lie down
Toss some thoughts around

Gordon Lightfoot,"I can always try to forget somehow
What's a part of the past
Have a little laughter if you please

I won't even mind if it takes awhile
I've got time on my hands
I feel another chapter in the breeze

And somebody touched my heart string
Somebody made my heart sing
And somebody stole my heart away
Nobody's sayin' their sorry

It's a mighty sweet music
You can dance all night
Put some wood on the fire right now
Ecstasy made easy

Ecstasy I ask you, are you a name
Or just another patron with a smile?
Let me analyze you, are you a flame
Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild?

Somebody found my heart string
Somebody made my heart sing
And somebody touched my heart last night
Somebody set me in flight

It's a mighty sweet music
Take a chance they say
Put flame on the old iron stove
Ecstasy made easy

It's a mighty sweet music
Take a chance they say
Put some fire on the old iron stove
Ecstasy made easy, made easy

I hope I never lose what belongs to me
By the right of my birth
At midnight sailing out of Perth

Getting under way we turned westward bound
On that southern sea
To sea what ecstasy was worth

Gordon Lightfoot,"You've got time enough for two of us
What is mine, I will share
We've got things that we can do without
Most anytime, anywhere

Every little daydream that appears in all we do
Gives us some problems of our own
If you turn back to that page again
And you can't win, if you ask me, I'll tag along

Paper matches in the afternoon
Cups of tea and all of that Zen
I think, it's time we took a walk outside
It seems there is no oxygen

This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone
I believe, it's best we carry on
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along

Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust
When we get back where we belong
If you ever turn that page again
You need a friend, if you ask me, I'll tag along

This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone

",I'll Tag Along
Gordon Lightfoot,"""Nothing is for certain""
That's what the showman said
First you must open the curtain
And stand 'em on their heads

There can be no inhibitions
No prima donna ways
If you want to pass the audition
And times is tough these days

Remember when Mr. Barnum
Presented Jenny Lind
They named a candy after her
A circus after him

End of my story
The rest is history
She in all of her glory
He lived quietly

He needed her, she needed him
As sure as the skies above
In a way it was for them
A lesson in love, a lesson in love

You look like the moon glow
That follows me home
Always makes me turn around
Won't leave me alone

First to come are the midgets
A monkey and a kid
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers
The ego and the id

Songs of the season
Apples of the sun
There is no rhyme or reason
Just a time for each and every one

Hang on Mr. Barnum
Hang on Jenny Lind
We will meet you in streets of gold
Where eternity begins

We will let it all hangout
Go hand in glove
Life was meant to live and learn
A lesson in love, a lesson in love
",A Lesson in Love
Gordon Lightfoot,"These are just the simple facts, I will relate to you
Though they are not connected, each and every one is true
If they seem a bit untidy, well, unraveling them is fun
I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone

I just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind
I just let it ride

I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found

He just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leave on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot
They just let it ride

One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night

They just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride
I'm gonna let it ride

Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon

I just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leave on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

Ride, ride, ride
I'm gonna let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride
",Let It Ride
Gordon Lightfoot,"Pretty faces everywhere
A few hard cases stop and stare
They've got charm that is not right
Pretty faces late at night

Morning Glory what's the story?
Will it ever end?
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
And all the way back again
All the way back again

I remember our old rendezvous
The key was kept inside a shoe
Those moments will remain frozen in time
Morning Glory's on my mind

What's the story Morning Glory?
Will it ever end?
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
And all the way back again
All the way back again

It seems like only yesterday
She married me and carried me away
I found out what life was all about
Morning Glory threw me out

Hey, Morning Glory what's the story?
Will it ever end?
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
And all the way back again
All the way back again

Alimony, Palimony, puts a dent in me
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
For a dip in the shining sea
A dip in the shining sea

Pretty faces everywhere
A few hard cases stop and stare
Even when I know it ain't my day
A lot of good faces anyway

Morning Glory what's the story?
What is it to be?
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
For a dip in the shining sea

Gordon Lightfoot,"A passing ship
I have found the open ocean
Give me no lip
The waves roll by as I pass on

A sunlit sea
On the first day of April
How fresh the wind
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

How many words
How many songs still unwritten?
How many ships
Of the line have come and gone?

In the good old days
May they never be forgotten
They had heavy wind
Or they had no wind at all

A passing ship
It is midnight on the ocean
Had a real long trip
I have been at sea all winter

When my ship came in
I was givin' up the ghost
I think I should be
Leavin' those passing ships alone

When the sea runs high
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady
And I think of you
In the warmth of your home and family

When love is true
There is no truer occupation
And may this gale
Blow us to the ones we love

Another day, another ocean
Give me no lip
But stand aside as I pass on
A sunlit sea
On the last day in October

How fresh the wind
Will you miss me from now on?
I guess I should be
Leavin' passing ships alone

Gordon Lightfoot,"If you've got a heartache
Of the kind that will not pass by
Even if you don't see the end
Of what lies around the bend
Don't stay that way
It's all in a day believe me
Even the best of dreams must end
Even so it grieves me
Stay loose, don't fight it
Let it take you all the way and
If it's wrong, you will right it
Do not waste these hours away
How many times have I told you
These are the tears I've shed
Could it be that I need help
Is it maybe I've come undone
And one thing more
You know it don't come easy
Even the best of friends must part
Even so it grieves me
Stay loose, don't fight it
Let love take a holiday
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it
Do not waste these hours away
Soon the storm will be over
And the clouds will all pass by
To be insane beyond belief
Is sometimes the best relief
And one thing sure
Love never did come easy
Even the best of dreams must end
Even so it grieves me
Stay loose, don't fight it
Let it take you all the way and

Gordon Lightfoot,"His father was a man who could never understand
The shame on a red man's face
So they lived in the hills and they never came down
But to trade in the white man's place

It was early in the spring when the snow had disappeared
They came down with a bag of skins
In the fall of the year of 1910
Daddy died by the rope down in Cherokee Bend. 

Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did 
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
There was blood on the floor of the government store
When the men took his daddy away
But the boy stayed back till he come to his end
And he run like the wind from Cherokee Bend. 

Now the mother was alone and the winter was at hand
And she prayed to her spirit kin
It was warm in the lodge in the Kentucky hills
On the day when the boy came in

Then a blizzard came down and it covered up the door 

Till they thought that it never would end
And he told her the tale of the terrible affair
In the government store down in Cherokee Bend

Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied

For three long days and three long nights
They wept and they mourned and then
She returned to her work and her weavin'
And they tried to forget about Cherokee Bend

Now the boy wasn't big but he hunted what he could
And they lived for a time that way
But the food run low and the meat went bad 
And she said to the boy one day

I'm leaving tonight and I never will return 
>From the land of my Spirit Kin
You must take what you need and trade what you can 
For a Red Man's grave down in Cherokee Bend

It wasn't very long till she closed her eyes
And he wrapped her in a robe
He found her a place on the side of the hill 
And he buried her in the snow

Early in the spring he was seen in the town 
With his load looking ragged and thin
Not a year had gone by till he stood once again 
In the government store down in Cherokee Bend

He was ten years tall and a Redskin too
So he hadn't much face to save
And the men sat around and they laughed and they clowned
At the talk of a criminal's grave

Then the man from the east didn't smile when he said 
You're the son of that Indian scum
If you value your hide then you better abide 
By the white man's rules here in Cherokee Bend. 

Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied

And he spit on the floor of the government store
And it served him to no good end
At the close of the day they had taken him away 
To the white man's school down at Cherokee Bend

It's been 21 years since the boy disappeared
Where he run to, nobody knows
But they say he fell in with a man named Jim
And he rides in the rodeos

And they say he returns all alone to a place 
Hidden deep in the Kentucky glen
And it's pretty well known who hauled up the stone 
To the grave on the hill above Cherokee Bend

Daddy didn't like what the white man said

She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin'

We're always there to greet him
When he tumbles into town
He leads a string of ponies
Some are white and some are brown
And they never seem to kick or bite
They only want to play
And they live on candy apples
Instead of oats and hay 

And when we're all assembled
He gives a soft command
And we climb aboard our ponies
As in a row the stand
Then down the road we gallop
And across the fields we fly
And soon we all go sailing off
Into the midnight sky 

And as we gaily rock along
Beside a ripplin' sea
There's Tom 'n Dick 'n Sally
And Mary Joe and me
And the pony man is leading
Cause he's travelled here before
And he gives a whoop and a holler
At Mr. Moon's front door 

And as we stop to rest a while
Where the soda river glides
Up to the slip comes a pirate ship
To take us for a ride
And the pony man's the captain
And the children are the crew
And we go in search of treasure
And laugh the whole night through 

And when the hold is filled with gold
And the sails begin to strain
And the deck's piled high with apple pie
We head for port again
And down the whirling starcase
So swift our ponies fly
And we're safely in our beds again
When the sunbeams kiss the sky 

When it's midnight on the meadow
And the cats are in the shed
And the river tells a story
At the window by my bed
If you listen very closely
Be as quiet as you can
In the yard you'll hear him
It is the pony man",Pony Man
Gordon Lightfoot,"You think you had the last laugh
Now you know this can't be true
Even though the sun shines down upon you now
Sometimes you must feel blue
You make the best of each new day
You try not to be sad
Even though the sky falls down upon you
Call it midnight, feelin' bad

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow
Do it soon

The road to love is littered
By the bones of other ones
Who by the magic of the moment
Were mysteriously undone
You try to understand it
But you never seem to find
Any kind of freedom comin' clean
Is just another state of mind

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow
Do it soon

So take the best of all that's left
You know this cannot last
Even though your mother was you maker
From her apron strings you pass
Just think about the fool
Who by his virtue can be found
In a most unusual situation
Playin' jester to the clown

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow
Do it soon

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow
Do it soon",Race Among the Ruins
Gordon Lightfoot,"Won't you reach out, love and touch me
Let me hold you for awhile?
I been all around the world
Oh, how I long to see you smile

There's a shadow on the moon
And the waters here below
Do not shine the way they should
And I love you just in case you didn't know
Let it go

Let it happen like it happened once before
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone
And if you do not believe me
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door

Won't you lie down by me, baby
Run your fingers through my hands?
I been all around the town
And still I do not understand

Is it me or is it you?
Or the shadow of a dream?
Is it wrong to be in love?
Could it be the finest love I've ever seen?
Set it free

Let it happen like it happened once before
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone
And if you do not believe me
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door

Please kiss me gently, darling
Where that river runs away
From the mountains in the spring time
On a blue and windy day

Where there's beauty all around
As the shades of night grow deep
When the morning stars grow dim
They will find us in the shadows fast asleep
Let it go

Let it happen like it happened once before
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone
And if you do not believe me
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door

Gordon Lightfoot,"Oh the gist of it all is the first day of fall is the day when my ship 
Will set sail
The best of all friends will say good-bye again there's still time for 
One last glass of ale
We'll sail away proudly, our backs to the wall on a southwind and lots 
Of good cheer
And when we've looked over the white cliffs of Dover, We'll be in Bahama 
Next year
From Bermuda on down the Triangle around us will teach us a lesson or 
Two
There's many a mate who unevenyly stated the course he had charted was 
True
""Don't worry 'bout me,"" he said ""Go down below, give a certified sailor 
A turn,
Just sip on your rum or I'll give you my thumb and say, son you got 
Something t' learn!""

It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found
So hand me my grip from an old sailing ship
Put the kiss of the dawn on my lips
With some luck tonight I might have her at my fingertips

Oh the best of all things is the first day of spring when when the water 
Runs heavy and fast
The mermaids have all gone to Davy Jones' Ball
And it seems their first trip was their last
They had so much fun
They don't wish to return
To the beach where they lay all day long
They'd rather stay under
And boy it's no wonder
When all the rock lobsters roll on
It's a mighty fine way to be found

Triangle Triangle 
Oh see my ship dangle
We're bound for Bahama my friend
Like lovers like danger
Like babies like mangers
But that's where my storybook ends
Like soldiers of fortune, believers in God
And all kings without crosses to bear
All sweepers and cleaners
With no misdemeanors
Should try the triangle out there

It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found
So hand me my grip
From an old sailing ship
Put the kiss of dawn on my lips
With some luck tonight 
I might have her at my fingertips

When she took her last tumble
The sea bottom rumbled
There was no confusion or blame
The captain said ""Men we must answer again to the sea so ye may not 
Complain""
And as they lay sleeping down there in the deep
With their faces turned up to the stars
A tuna fish turned
To a mermaid in bed and said 
""There goes another sandbar""

It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found 
So hand me my grip

Gordon Lightfoot,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called 'gitche gumee'
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven pm a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good t'know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams

Gordon Lightfoot,"Black day in July
Motor city madness has touched the countryside
And through the smoke and cinders
You can hear it far and wide
The doors are quickly bolted
And the children locked inside

Black day in July
Black day in July
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land

Black day in July
Black day in July
In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground
Upon the filthy pavement
No reason can be found

Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor City madness has touched the countryside
And the people rise in anger
And the streets begin to fill
And there's gunfire from the rooftops
And the blood begins to spill

Black day in July

In the mansion of the governor
There's nothing that is known for sure
The telephone is ringing
And the pendulum is swinging
And they wonder how it happened
And they really know the reason
And it wasn't just the temperature
And it wasn't just the season

Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor City's burning and the flames are running wild
They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake
And everyone is listening
And everyone's awake

And the news is quickly flashed
And you read your morning paper
And you sip your cup of tea
And you wonder just in passing
Is it him or is it me

In the office of the President
The deed is done the troops are sent
There's really not much choice you see
It looks to us like anarchy
And then the tanks go rolling in
To patch things up as best they can
There is no time to hesitate
The speech is made the dues can wait

Black day in July
Black day in July
The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene
But the shapes of gutted buildings
Strike terror to the heart
And you say how did it happen
And you say how did it start
Why can't we all be brothers
Why can't we live in peace
But the hands of the have-nots
Keep falling out of reach

Gordon Lightfoot,"There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real

But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds
As to this verdant country they came from all around
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall
Built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us all

And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay

For they looked in the future and what did they see
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land
All up through the seaports and into their hands

Look away said they across this mighty land
From the eastern shore to the western strand
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow

Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We're gonna lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow

Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away

We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done

We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done

So over the mountains and over the plains
Into the muskeg and into the rain
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town
A dollar a day and a place for my head
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead

Oh the song of the future has been sung
All the battles have been won
O'er the mountain tops we stand
All the world at our command
We have opened up the soil
With our teardrops and our toil

For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
And many are the dead men too silent to be real",Canadian Railroad Trilogy
Gordon Lightfoot,"Sit by my side come as close as the air
Sharin' a memory of grey
And wander in my words
And dream about the pictures that I play
Of changes 

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time parade
Of changes 

Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
For when the morning breaks
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn
Of changes 

Passions will part to a warm melody
As fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls
Of changes 

Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else
One last cup of wine we will pour
I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling river shore
Of changes",Changes
Gordon Lightfoot,"I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'

Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside
But I was young and able
When I came out the other end
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble
Unreadable

I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go
I thanked him
A face of white, a face of brown
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger
For a stranger

It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York

Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me""

I came down to live alone in New York
The city of the living
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men
Were taking, none we giving
Or forgiving

Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways
I saw them
There were men who lived in style and others who had died
Where no one knew them
Beause they couldn't win

There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms
Where babies crept unwanted
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope
Or if it mattered what they did
Or if they lived

It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York

Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me""

I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'

And there were prophets in the squares
And people there who smiled and said, ""Forget it""
There were lovers in the park
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it
So afraid of it

And there were preachers of the Word and poets
Who were never heard, I heard them
There were those who would not try to learn
The measure of the lie they're livin'

I heard a young musician play in a place
Where they paid you not to listen
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by
And offered their best wishes
That's how it is

It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York

Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me""

Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day

",Cold Hands from New York
Gordon Lightfoot,"When first I did appear upon this native soil
All up and down this country at labor I did toil
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run 

When first I did come down where the land meets the sea
The people said Who are you and what would your name be
I said I have no home and I am no man's son 
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come 

In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done 

So I swung an axe as a timberjack
And I worked the Quebec mines
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds 

I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring 

In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done 

But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide
And the legacy I'm leavin' you is not very hard to find
You'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' At the crossroads of time",Crossroads
Gordon Lightfoot,"Oh, when he was a man, my father would stand
I never saw him run
There wasn't anyone could make the man bend
The strength of his will was the tool of his trade
And he did his work well

Till the powers that be took a liking to him
And they traded his body for a cold empty shell

Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got something to say
Don't you stand in my way
And don't beat me down

Oh, when I was a youth, I found the truth
In the eyes of a friend
There wasn't anyone could make the light dim
And we talked and we rambled and we gambled to win
And the learning was good

Till the powers that be to a liking to him
They traded their fortunes for the sight of his blood

When I was a child and my mother smiled
At the cradle she bought
For the little tot she held to her breast
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love
It was all that I heard

Till the powers that be took a liking to me
And they told me that love was a four-letter word

Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got one life to live
And that's all I can give
So don't beat me down

And now I've got a place, I got a worried face
And a question in mind
Please let me find a reason somehow
Why some reap the harvest while other men die
And the joker runs wild

And if powers that be take a liking to us
Then we all must return to the ways of a child
We all must return to the ways of a child

So don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got something to say
Don't you stand in my way
And don't beat me down

I've got one life to life
And that's all I can give
So don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down

Gordon Lightfoot,"Alone upon the sidewalks of despair, 'twas there she wandered
With her suitcase in her hand
Her fate she pondered
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was grooving
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?

In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere

He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care, a go-go girl in love",Go-Go Round
Gordon Lightfoot,"Step inside my tent, said she, ""I'd like to read you palm""
Leave the dollar in the jar, this won't take very long
Leave the circus noise behind, close your eyes, relax your mind
I'll tell you, if you should quit now or if you should go on

Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
Where'll I go, what'll I be?
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""

She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake
She told me, the town where I was born, she almost knew the date
She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise
She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight

Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
You are so old, you are so wise
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy

Give me a sign, tell it to me
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
Then she spoke most quietly
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee

When you we a child at school they taught you quite a lot
You were told when you should speak and when you should not
You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night
A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not

Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
Where'll I go, what'll I be?
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""

Then when I came home that night to lie in bed awake
I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said
And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get
So if you feel you've no regrets, go have your fortune read

Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
You are so old, you are so wise
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy

Give me a sign, tell it to me
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
Then she spoke most quietly
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee

Where'll I go, what'll I be
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
You are so old, you are so wise

Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy
Give me a sign, tell it to me
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""

Gordon Lightfoot,"I'll be alright I'll be alright if I don't have to smile
If I don't to face the morning sunrise for a while
I'll get along you know I'll take tomorrow with a grin
If I never have to think about her love again 

And I won't mind if words are spoken
In empty love songs as long as I don't have to hear
I'll be alright if I don't have to face the world again
And if I never love again I'll be alright 

Last night she gave the final word, she said her last goodbye
And disappeared forever in the world outside
One kiss and then she took her leave to go I know not where
Into the misty shadows of the midnight air

So, don't you let it go

Gordon Lightfoot,"Where the long river flows
It flows by my window
Where the tall timber grows
It grows 'round my door
Where the mountains meet the sky
And the white clouds fly
Where the long river flows
By my window 

There's a tiny bird that calls
And he calls by my window
There's a lonely tear that falls
And it falls 'round my door
But when the sun is high
There's no time to cry
Where the long river flows
By my window 

Now if only you could see
The closin' of the day
If only you could be
Where the dawn breaks away
By the white cascade
Oh down in the glade
Where the long river flows
By my window 

Well when this land was made
It was made full of wonder
But one woman's love
I can't understand
And I'd give it all to you
If her love were true
Where the long river flows
By my window
Where the long river flows
By my window",Long River
Gordon Lightfoot,"That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

I've seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal
In every town I've been to I've had someone to call
From Winnipeg to Edmonton, Vancouver to St. Paul
I've had so many good friends I couldn't miss them all

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Last night I came to Denver beneath the snowcapped ridge
I thought about my darling as I stood beneath the bridge
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned
That any time I've wandered I always have returned

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

While climbing up a hillside, Bill drops her down a gear
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can
Driving like the restless wind across this precious land

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Says Bill, ""The air is clean tonight"", as he puffs a big cigar
""And if this rig keeps rolling, my boy you'll travel far
But when you are a trucker you'll come to realize
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by""

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again
That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Gordon Lightfoot,"It is said that all the good things
Must come to him who can pretend
He doesn't have to wait
For as surely as the light of day
Must come to drive the night away
The needles and the pins
That's where the line begins

With your magnificent outpouring
Of that old familiar story
That's been used a million times
To ease a million minds

There are times when I have told you
That there must be two of us
To try to work things out
But if I can't see you every day
Then I must hide my thoughts away
And see you when I can
And try to understand

With your magnificent outpouring
Of that old familiar story
That's been used a million times
To ease a million minds

So let us treat our love likeany game
To fan the flames would really be a sin
For as surely as the snow must fall
I shall be waiting for your call
Pretending it is spring
And you'll be mine again

Gordon Lightfoot,"Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh we are close to land
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band

Now have you seen the harbor cried Marie Christine
Have you seen the jagged rocks in the waters in between
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh save me if you can
For if you do I promise you I'll never sail again

Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched lot
Now gather all your photographs and don your coats of blue
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you

When at first I saw Marie Christine the woman that she was
I signed aboard to man her sails and honor well her cause
I christened her with old champagne and I drove her to the west
Of all the men who sailed on her, in truth I sailed her best

Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh we are close to land
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band

Now come all you would be sailors
All you would be sailors, oh, all you would be sailors
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you

Within the valley so free
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow 
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea
When will you love me
As I love thee

Nor gowns of soft crimson hue
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her 
Into my heart so strong so true

Their mighty men are beaten down the kings are fallen in the ways

Terror is on everyside though the leaders are dismayed
Those who put their faith in fire in fire their faith shall be repaid

Gordon Lightfoot,"Early in the morning when the dew is on, each and every rose bud, you will find me gone.
So knock me down and pick me up and knock me down again,
Break my heart steal my gold and slander my good name.
Seven lonely hours on the morning train takes me to a place where I won't come back again.

Seven lonely Pullmans speeding down the line taking me away from an old love of mine.
Sixteen miles to seven lakes way up among the pines 
In some hidden valley where the twirling river twines.

Where the fish swim up and down and the sparkling water falls,
Where the thunder rolls and the lonely puma calls,
Somewhere on the mountain I'll take another name,
Rid my mind of memories and start my life again.
Somewhere in the wilderness I'll build a cabin small, then forget so I won't remember you at all.",Sixteen Miles (To Seven Lakes)
Gordon Lightfoot,"The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top
The snow is softly fallin'
The air is still within the silence of my room
I hear your voice softly callin'

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead
My glass is almost empty
I read again between the lines upon the page
The words of love you sent me

If I could know within my heart
That you were lonely too
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim
The shades of night are liftin'
The mornin' light steals across my windowpane
Where webs of snow are driftin'

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
And to be once again with with you
To be once again with with you",Song for a Winter's Night
Gordon Lightfoot,"Well I got my mail late last night
A letter from a girl who found the time to write
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night
She sent me a railroad ticket too
To take me to her lovin' arms
And the big steel rail 
Gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Ooooh oooo oo whu hu hoo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo 

Well I bin out here many a long days
I haven't found a place that I could call my own
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on
I bin stood up I bin shook down
I bin dragged into the sand
And the big steel rail 
Gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I bin up tight most every night
Walkin' along the streets of this old town
Not a friend to tell my troubles to
My good old car she done broke down
'Cause I drove it into the ground
And the big steel rail 
Gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I look over yonder across the plain
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal 
And Lord I need one now
And the big steel rail 
Gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Now here I am with my hat in hand
Standin' on the broad highway will you give a ride
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night
I went in town for one last round
And I gambled my ticket away
And the big steel rail 
Won't carry me home to the one I love",Steel Rail Blues

Gordon Lightfoot,"I was at the break wall, I was lookin' at the sea
In back of the eight ball in some misery
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home
Any way I can lose myself

Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'
I'm fading away, fading away

They sailed right up to me, I said, ""What's it all about
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real
Let me tell ya 'bout it, brother, it was somethin' you could feel""

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely, I let twilight set the tone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace, that's a good long way to roam
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now

Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'
I'm fading away, fading away

One more day on the calendar in my mind
I am down at the break wall puttin' in some time
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone

Anywhere I stray, I will make it a brand new day

Anyway, that is all I've gotta say
I'd rather be by the seaside
Than be playing a one night stand
I've been too wrapped up in my own dreams

I will change things if I can
I gotta press on, don't wanta rest easy
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine
And all of the sunshine that we knew

You will never know what blue is
Until you have played the game
Till you live life in solitaire where
No one knows your name

I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy
Have it anyway you will
I will be with you right up until
The spell is broken and all is well

If you'd rather be by the seashore
Well, I sure can understand
Are you too wrapped up in your own scene
I would change things if I can

I'd rather press on, don't want to rest easy

But remembering the rhythm and the rhymes
And all of the good times makes me blue

Gordon Lightfoot,"Does the light of passion still burn bright?
Only love would know my imagination
Tells me I'm a pent-up fool in the deep end of the pool
Is the light of passion burnin' tonight?
Only love would know, only love would know

She lives on the other side, you wanna know the reason why
She arrives at promises and you believe in what she says
Everywhere you go
Is the light of passion burnin' bright?
Everywhere you go, only love would know

You think, you've been wronged again
Oh what a way to treat a friend
She belongs to other eyes and surely you must realize
She ain't the kind who would soon step aside
Pay any dues at the expense of her pride
Everywhere she goes, only love would know

In the days gone by I came to believe
Everything is trust, all the rest is dust
Mother nature, mother dear, listen to us over here
Are the sounds of laughter ringing true?
Only love would know, only love would do

She lives on another plane away from the drivin' rain
She says no, you say yes
And that's how it should be I guess
Only love would know

May the light of love surround you tonight
Everywhere you go, only love would know

You think, you were wrong until
You learned once and for all it's still
One more lesson on the way
Or that is what it seemed to say

She's not the kind who would soon step down
Not the kind you would try to walk around
When only a thought would go very well
You can tell by the touch
Ah but only love would know

Tears of passion late at night
Is the light of passion burning bright?
Everywhere you go, only love would know

Gordon Lightfoot,"There's a kind of a restless feeling and it pulls me from within
It sets my senses reeling and my wheels begin to spin
In the quietude of winter you can hear the wild geese cry
And I will always love that sound until the day I die
There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest
From every quiet dance who might be a special guest
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview
You might even find them on the Young and the Restless too
Do ya get that restless feelin' when you hear a whistle blast
Like an echo from the past
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's iron cast
The lake is blue, the sky is gray, the leaves have turned to gold
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest
We will be returning to the things that we love best
Do ya get that restless yearning when you think about your dad
And the scrimshaw that he had
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad
There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard
As we gaze off at the distance through the trees in my back yard
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home
Will ya get that restless yearning when you hear the wicked blast
Of a specter from the past
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last
Still I get that restless feelin' when I hear a whistle blast
See an image from the past
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast",Restless
Gordon Lightfoot,"Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams
Ring them bell from the sanctuaries, 'cross the valleys and streams
For they're deep and they're wide, and the world's on its side
And time is a-runnin' backwards and so is the bride

Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel of the plow
And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow

Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through?
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child who cries when innocence dies

Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong
",Ring Them Bells
Gordon Lightfoot,"I have been down in valley of tears
I have stood on the highest peak
For the best part of a week
Battered and bruised I had pulled myself through
Every scene I would never repeat

I have hung out with the beasts of the field
And with them I've spent many a long nights
Got in some awful bad fights
I came unstuck, I was down on my luck
And I'm still gettin' over the bites

Sounds of my own heart breaking
Not to mention my mind
?Nothing can hurt me? a small voice said
Into a mike, take a hike

No one will lead me astray anymore
You are welcome to try if you like
Welcome to try if you like

I had been down in the valley so long
I had almost run out of respect
Got in right up to my neck
Battered but wise to the truth and the lies
That no layman would ever accept

Reachin' for all of the good things in life
Can provide some surprises I guess
It be may the way we are dressed
These threads that you see mean so little to me
They don't count when they put us to rest

Late about dusk I would start to feel
One more day had been lost
Nothin' I'd say ever seemed to convey
How I felt with that I have dealt

All of my children are healthy and sane
They may say anything that they like
Say anything that they like

Sitting alone in the Blue Ridge Saloon
Is no place for an angel to be
Ladies make faces at me
Battered but clean I had pulled my machine
Off the road, I was too tired to see

Wearing a smile like the rim of a cup
I will get down to my final point
There is no one left to anoint
And the sowing of seed was it good, yes indeed
It thrills me but only to a point

Use your imagination
Try every trick in the book
My mother said with the life that I led
I'd be broke, holy smoke

All of my children are healthy and sane
They may say anything that they like
Say anything that they like

If they want to preach and are not within reach
They may say anything that they like
Say anything that they like

Is it really true you can really never win?

Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride

To be standing up here with you down there
Let it now be known that throughout all of these years
I have been wearing polka dot underwear

And the cows will come home they can face the world forever and we'll

Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train
Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride

Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane

Gordon Lightfoot,"Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee

I would rather be at the boathouse, out of the daily grind
I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to be set back
So I'm leavin' here on a one-way track

I'd rather be in mosquito alley, out of my right hand lane
You'd rather see my mosquiot tally, all that moves is fair game
Now I don't wanna know how it feels not to be loose
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose
I'm leavin' here on the first caboose

I can't sleep by a gentle ocean and I can't sleep my a water fall
I can't sleep by a lovely river, I can't sleep and I can't sleep

I would rather sleep at the boathouse, what more can I say
I'd soon eat down at the boathouse, let it carry me away
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to step aside
So I'm leavin' here on a wicked ride

Or I could be back at the alehouse, with a flagon or two
A few blocks south of the jail house, with a hole in my shoe
Now, I don't wanna know how it feels to stop a truck
So I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck

Gordon Lightfoot,"I don't believe in miracles if it's all the same by you
Your wishes would come true if I had my say
Whether it's right or wrong, the words of every song
Remind us of a love we knew
Where love should not go wrong, in yesterdays

Hang on ye drifters now
You got so much to go and gamble on
Watch out for the shifting sand
Where ever you may ramble

Even now, as I look back and see all that's come to pass
I can't remember how it was I got here
Look around this place, there's a smile on every face
We're somewhere in the afterglow, out there among the stars
Out there among the bars

Hang on ye drifters now
You got places to go and people to meet
Watch out for the shifting tide
Where ever you may travel

I know I should not complain because life's been good to me
It feels real good to be stranded on my own
Be that as it may be, we are what we are
I'll find you in the afterglow out there among the stars
Of yesteryear

Hang on ye drifters now
You got so much to go and gamble on
Watch out for the shifting sand
Where ever you may ramble

You got places to go and people to meet

Gordon Lightfoot,"I saw two dreamers dreamin'
They almost caused a spark
I saw two lovers in paradise right back at the start
I saw two minds in the world set free
But it almost broke my heart
Isn't it strange to be right now havin' you close to me?

Much to my surprise

I saw two schemes schemin'
They almost caused a lark
They were two brave souls on a wild blue spree
Right back at the park
They were like two ships
And they sailed right by each other in the dark

Wouldn't ya like to be right now
Out where the actors play?
So much for your disguise

I saw two souls out searchin'
They said their last goodbyes
And I saw two hearts of passion then
Much to my surprise
I saw two hearts on passion bent
The kind which mystifies

It is so strange to be right now
Having you on my knee
Much to my surprise

I gotta make you see somehow

I saw two minds that wandered
They almost caused a wreck
They were all checked out for a wild blue sea
When someone cried hit the deck
I saw two minds in the world set wise
But I almost broke my specs

Wouldn't ya like to be right now
Out where the actors play
So much for your disguise

I would rather make a living instead
Instead of bein' in the red

See the people movin' all around
On the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street
Longest street in the world they say
Summertime soon slips away
I hope I'll see you one fine day on Yonge Street

Everywhere you go in a city by the lake
Back there in the flow you may give a hand a shake
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello
Even late at night on the freshly fallen snow

See the children jumpin' all around
See the parents looking up and down
Upon the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street
It's a mean street if you choose
It's a lean street when you loose
An' in between street when you cruise along Yonge Street

Everywhere you go in a city by the lake
You'll be sure and find it's a case of give and take
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello
Even late at night when the streets are all aglow

It's the longest street in the world
With the most feet in the world
Another street where boy meets girl on Yonge Street
See the people walkin' up and down

Once upon a time like you've never known
Once upon a time I would be impressed
Once upon a time my life would be obsessed

Once upon a time, once upon a day
When I was in my prime, once along the way
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me
For I am just a painter passing through in history

Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait

Once upon a time, once upon a day
When I was in my prime, once along the way
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around
For I am just a painter passing through the underground

I was in my stride, always at my game
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame
I was in demand, always in control
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold

Once upon a time, I was in a daze
When I was in my prime, once along the way
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me
For I am just a painter passing through in history

Now that I am old, let me rest a spell
All that I am told, I can never tell
Never in my life, never will it pass
I am still alone, remembering at last

Once upon a time, once upon a day
When I was in my prime, once along the way

And the dust autumn winds begin to blow
Shoulda known I couldn't hold livin' out so far from town
And the nights to come are long are slow to go
Well now she's up and left me and when walkin' down the line
And the dusty autumn wind begins to blow
All dressed up in red velvet and he high heeled shoes so fine
And the nights to come are long and slow to go

Well if I had only know before we kissed
You can't keep red velvet on a poor dirt farm like this

Oh now she's gone and left me and went walkin' down the line
And the dusty autumn winds begin to blow

Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around
When the dusty autumn winds begin to blow
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll drive on into town
Cause the nights to come are long and slow to go

Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around

Waitin' them boys they bin stayin' out late
Uncle Toad thinks, they're way out of line
Maybe they think, he is past his prime

Uncle Toad said, ?Better straighten up right?
When uncle Toad spoke it was not a pretty sight

Uncle Toad lived in the wood out back
Lived in the shade of a utility shack
He looked in at the big brick house
At the girls as quiet as a mouse

Uncle Toad said, ?you had best get it right?
When Uncle Toad spoke it was not a pretty sight

Uncle Toad tucked in the compost pile
Out by the back door, look at him smile
He said, ?Kid stop drinkin' that brew
Plan while ya can or the joke's on you?

Sits in the sun when the weather turns cool
Sits in the sun when the girls walk by

All day long with a grin on his face

Gordon Lightfoot,"Born in the country and I like that country smile
Of the little girls and boys, they remind me of a child
That I knew and a big harvest moon
That shone by supper time in the dusty afternoon

And I need to be there when the autumn wind goes
Singing through the trestle we would climb
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time

Born in the country and I like that country song
We played for just a nickel every time we got to town
And I bought you a dime diamond ring
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings

And I need to be there when the world
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time

Born in the country and I like that country way
Of the uncles aunts and cousins, and the card games they would play
While the young ones slept overhead
Beneath the quilts that mother made, when all the prayers were said

And I need to be there when the autumn wind
Goes singing through the trestle we would climb
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time

And I need to be there when the world
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time

Gordon Lightfoot,"It's alright for some, but not alright for me
When the one that I'm lovin' slips around
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me, baby can't you see that I know how it is

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

It's alright for some, but not alright to be
Where the one that I'm lovin' can't be found
The city where we live might be quite large
But the circle is small, why not tell us all and then all of us will know

I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking like this

When I was one year old
Sitting by the backyard fence
And the world had turned so cold

Was all that they were told

There's no time to wonder why

We'd love to take life over that is plain
Forget about sorrow, forget about pain
And watch a John Wayne movie
To remind us once again

Better drink yer glasses empty now

Drink yer glasses girls and boys
It's time to hit the sky

Forget about reason, forget about rhyme
Because beg, steal or borrow
You got another hill to climb

So drink yer glasses empty now

There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for

Drink yer glasses girls and boys
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder
There's no time to wonder why

When time of war had passed away into the rain
And watch a John Wayne movie
To remind us of the plains

Just drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to rise and shine
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for

Listen up and I'll tell you what is true
They done some thinking and they changed a thing or two
You been living in the hindsight
Of a backwards point of view

I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it
Sometimes I wonder why I even try
So why should I feel blue?

I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark
I poked my head out silent, that's how it started
What to my eyes appeared as dust
Became a vision I don't know

What had finally found me with my back against the wall
Was destiny intruding all around me
And as the day wore on I knew
Another lonely night could never be

If there's is a reason you might try and forget
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry
So why should I feel blue?

I was caught drifting disappearing from the land
Whitecaps in profusion all around me
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength
To sail upon the raging sea

If theres a reason for the way that life is
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it

Sometimes I wonder why I even try
So why should I feel blue?

What had finally found me with my back against the wall
Was destiny intruding all around me
And as the days wore on I knew
Another lonely night with you could never be

I saw a moonlit scene I know it was real
All that you can ever do when love is reveal

Sometimes I every try why I even try
So why should I feel blue?

Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry
So why should I feel blue?

Gordon Lightfoot,"The oceans of the world were the home of big blue
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew
And the place that he loved best
Was the waters to the west
Around the blue Pacific he did roam

Big Blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he
And the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see
And he took them one by one and he drove them all away
In the mating of the day he was the king

Big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons
Though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns
Ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners' eyes
And so he lived at sea a hundred years

His mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say
His hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small
And his back was all scarred by the times he got away
And he knew the smell of whalers did Big Blue

Big Blue passed away to his natural decay
Beside the Arctic Circle as he travelled up that way
And there never was a man who was born with a gunner's hand
Who ever took a pan to Big Blue

Now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done
The finbacks and the Greenland rights have all passed and gone
They've been taken by the men for the money they could spend
And the killing never ends, it just goes on

The oceans of the earth were the home of big blue
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew
And the place that he loved best was the waters to the west
Around the blue Pacific he did roam",Ode to Big Blue

Gordon Lightfoot,"Seven islands to the high side of the bay, 'cross the bay
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze
We went walking on the high side of the bay on a chilly morn
And we saw how leaves had fallen on the beds where trees were born
Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there

Seven islands to the high side of the bay if you're looking west
To the sunset you can see it, all in fiery autumn dress
Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused

Living high in the city, guess you think it's a pretty good way
You get to learn but when you get burned you got nothing to say
You seem to think because you got chicken to go you're in luck
Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out of luck

Look around at the morning, guess you're doing the best you can
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand
Think of the air you're breathing in, think of the time you waste
Think of the right and wrong and consider the frown on your face

It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away could be so blessed
Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold

If you feel it you better believe it, you're gonna see it, so you really 
know
It is rising like a feather, dipping and dancing from below
There's a new wave that is breaking in the wake of a passing ship
Every nation's gonna be shaken, put it together, don't let it slip

Gordon Lightfoot,"I spent most of my life outside, in the driving rain
I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me

It took most of my time to do what never was done
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you

I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price

From a long and a sleepless night
She returned again this morning
From her long and restless flight

And my red hollow eyes
Did not show her much surprise
As she lay right down beside me
Like she never said goodbye

Please help me station master
Is the evening train on time?
The well's run dry up yonder
There's another down the line

It was all I could bear
Just to watch her lying there
Disowned and ragged princess
With the sun locked in her hair

So cold, so frail
With her mind locked in a jail
The victim of confusion
Never knowing she could fail

Please help me station master
Is the evening train on time?
The well's run dry up yonder
There's another down the line

So I rocked her to sleep
Then I got up on my feet
And the day was filled with sunshine
As I gazed across the street

And the door seemed to say
Over here, step this way
The station is for travelers
Even you must ride someday

Please help me station master
Is the evening train on time?
The well's run dry up yonder
There's another down the line

Please help me station master
Can I stay for just a while?
Forgive me if I'm weary
I ain't had much, much time to smile

Gordon Lightfoot,"Where the road runs down but the butternut grove
To old Bill Skinner's stream
Do tell at the noonday bell
It's time for a summertime dream
In a lunch pail town in a one horse way
You can live like a king and queen
Let's steal away in the noonday sun
It's time for a summertime dream

Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees
And down below's a pond I know
You can swim in it if you please
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down
You can see what chivalry means
Let's steal away in the noonday sun
It's time for a summertime dream

On a trip on down to wonderland
In love among the flowers
Where time gets lost with no straw boss
Tallyin' up the hours
Where the road runs down by the butternut grove
To old Bill Skinner's stream
Do tell at the noonday bell
It's time for a summertime dream

Gordon Lightfoot,"Say what you will, I will miss you my friends
Let me move along for the road never ends
Vowing to live till the end of all time
All the way to the ends of the earth because I'm
Waiting for you to say you will be mine
Many long days, many long years
Many wrong plays, many wrong fears
I could be tossed in the arms of the sea
I could be caught between decks eternally
Waiting for you to ask what's keeping me

What would we do at the end of the day
When the hours are asleep and the time slips away
Children are all that the earth has to show
Children are all that the earth wants to know
Up here in the northland, up here in the snow

Up in the wilderness, land of our birth
Land of our toil, land of our worth
I could stay healthy and wealthy and wise
For I love the snow other snowbirds criticize
Tell that to a wife and you'll get a surprise

The skies of north america are covered in stars
Over factories and farms, over hamlets and bars
The breeze of north america is breathless at night
Out there in the distance some souls are in flight
Some soft-hearted lovers whose goals are in sight

Here in my on-again, off-again style
Here in my on-again, off-again smile
Here in my off-again, on-again grin
Here in my off-again, on-again skin
Waiting for you to say let us begin
",Waiting for You
Gordon Lightfoot,"What can you do? You'll never win
Where will you go when night closes in?
Where will it lead? Will it ever end?
Where will it stop?

Losing a friend isn't what we had in mind exactly
All we need is a friend I guess
With my midnight star to guide through
Clouds of loneliness

You knew someone but was it love?
So many years, push came to shove
You had a dream, so they had one too
You turned away, they were untrue

In our early days we were too willing
At the time we had yet to arrive
Many a man and a woman found
Trying to stay alive

Where will you go? What will you do
When your whole world ain't talking to you?
Maybe you think you will see the light
Baby, it's time you hope it's right

And I'm all dressed up to be somebody
All I need is a friendly face
With my midnight crowd to glide through
Clouds of empty space

Seems like every time we turn around
What we see could be anyone's guess
Many a man and a woman found in
Clouds of loneliness

",Clouds of Loneliness
Gordon Lightfoot,"There's a town they call Orillia, It is there of which I sing.
It is just above Lake Simcoe, by Lake Couchiching.

-Chorus-
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching.
Cooooochiching, by Lake Couchiching.
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching,
Coooochiching

Across the raging Narrows, Casino Rama stands.
Where there once were only sparrows, people come from other lands.
To the west lie hills aplenty, if skiing is your thing,
You can while away the summer, by Lake Couchiching.

-Chorus-

In Orillia they had movies, and sports and music too.
And all around the shore line, were the folks that we all knew.

-Chorus-

Now I've spent my life in travel, now I've spent my life in dust.
Now I've spent my life in family, now I've spent my life in trust.
Any way you'd like to cut in, It'll hit you with a ping.
When you think about Orillia, and it's by Lake Couchiching.

-Chorus-

When I get my final slumber, when I pawn my diamond ring,
I will do my final number, by Lake Couchiching.

-Chorus-",Couchiching
Gordon Lightfoot,"Oft times, I recall how it was in days gone by
No tears at all, now you better not make me cry
Because you know darn well
I may ring your bell

Is there anybody home?
Is there anyone in there?
Who can tell me where I am?

Oft times, I recall when there wasn't no need to lie
So much was said but we never did say goodbye
Oh, how I long to hear you whisper in my ear

Is there anybody home, don't you know I'm all alone?
Can you tell me where I am?
All I can do is love you 'til the end of all time

One day, time will tell when you're living in yesterday
Thinking of things to do, thinking of things to say
Thinking of things divine, find a bottom line

Is there anybody home?
Is there anyone in there?
Who can tell me where I am

Oft times I recall, I was thinking of ways to win
Ready to risk it, all until it wore thin
Oh, how I long to hear you whisper in my ear

Is there anybody home, don't you know, I'm all alone
Can you tell me where I am?
All I can do, is love you 'til the end of all time
All I can do is love you 'til the end of all time

Gordon Lightfoot,"Dreaming of a love I lost, the day the final bridge was crossed
Sometimes I wish that I could just forget
But the memory lingers yet and it hangs around
Leaving me low and leaving me down
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way

I begin to wake up, how wrong it was to cling to you
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart
'Cause I can't keep us apart, forgiving you
Was the easiest thing that I ever could do
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow

As I wander I return, to days gone by there's much to be learned
Sometimes I wish that miracles could be
But at best I fail to see any happening
Some gotta lose and some gotta win
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way

Everywhere I go, there is no one I know
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow
You're leaving right now

I got whiskers on my chin
And I like the mood I'm in
As I while away the time of day

Tall and strong she dips and reels
I call her Silver Heels
And she tells me how she feels
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat
Through the toughest gales and keep smiling
But for one more day she would like to stay
In the lee of Christian Island
                                      
I'm sailing down the summer day
Where fish and seagulls play
I put my troubles all away
And when the gale comes up I'll fill my cup
With the whiskey of the highlands
She's a good old ship and she'll make the trip
From the lee of Christian Island
                                      
Tall and strong she slips along
I sing for her a song
And she leans into the wind

Gordon MacRae,"I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups and downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face

She's second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,

And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Where the oak and blackjack trees 
Kiss the playful prairie breeze

Call back my rose, rose of San Antone.

Dumps the trash and sweeps the halls
And he makes sure
That stained glass shines

Picks up paper in the pews
And stacks the chairs in the choir room
But his real work don't start
Till quittin' time

When he goes through every prayer request
Lying on the pastor's desk
He hits his knees
And says God bless Miss Sommersby

And Marianna Thompson
Wants her daddy back at home
And Mr. Nelson needs forgiveness
Old Man Miller's crops need rain

While the whole town's fast asleep
He's hard at work
Pullin' that midnight shift
At the Maplewood Methodist Church

Every night's the same routine
And by the time he finally leaves
He's done so much more
Than clean the building

He's called down angels from on high
And helped someone through a sad goodbye
And lost souls finally find what they've been missing

The congregation will never see
That simple man who still believes
He can change the world
By saying please

Give Johnny Mays
The strength to put that bottle down
Mrs. Bailey and her husband
Find a way to work things out
And Mrs. Olsen hold on long enough
To see her daughter's wedding day

Runs up your spine

I've got my memories (I'm keeping her ring)
We had 10 good years before I done her in

Lie still my precious...

Cling film wraps her up tigth
No longer able to fight
My wife, I tried to please her
I put her in the freezer
I wouldn't let her leave me
I hit her with a hammer
I used ice to tease her
Now it surrounds her in the freezer

I put her next to lollies and the packets of peas
With all frozen dinners placed precuriously by her knees
No room in my fridge 'cause it's full of her Barcardi Breezers
I've had to chop her up to fit her in the freezer

A freshly sharpened knife with a shiny blade
Holding the stump of her hand pretending to wave
Popped her eyes out and craved off her nose
Kept in a bag with her little fingers and toes
I'll eat her in a stew so she's always with me
My freezer's full of limb so there's plenty to eat

I can't fit her limbs in the fridge
I can't fit her dead limbs in the fridge",Can't Fit Her Limbs in the Fridge
Gorerotted,"Torture now follows my name
Amputation and killing becomes a game
Pain and agony is what they feel
As I slip them the drug that heals
Removing and decapitating these pathetic bits
From what was once a healthy bitch
Sawing a chiselling the limbs away
Chucked in a corner left to decay

A frozen body clinically cut
Tampered and plundered and totally gut
Symbolic memories of human trophies
Fridge full of limbs and no motives
Cadavers ripped apart and left to decay
Prostitute heaven such as prey
Cadavers ripped apart and left to decay

Frozen the bodies are all locked away
Buried put in holes left to decay
Infesting the insects begin to pick away

Gorerotted,"Bound and gaggd in a black pot
Seared and flavoured with herbs and salt
Marinated slowly in a secret sauce
Roasted and served as sumptuous course
They dribble and drool as I try and get loose
Stewing slowly in my own juice
Rubbing their tummies and licking their lips
Devoured me up and served with chips

By the time they're done there'll be no one left around
Just a special bus full of mutants geeks and downs
We'll be beaten tender so we taste real nice
When we're sliced and diced and served with rice
By the hobblin, wobbling, stammering spacks
And the inbred freaks with misshapen backs
Demented 'tards with missing teeth
Cutting me up and chewing on my meat

Masticated by the spasticated

Put me in a pot, put me in the pain
Boil up my bones, fry my glands
Take away my heart, put it in the coals
Slice me up fine, serve me in bowls

My name is John and I dress as a clown, thirty one bodies I've buried underground
A construction worker I like building flats and pulling rabbits out of hats
But under my make-up I'm a mischievous man
Killing as many boys as I can

[Jack The Ripper]
Do they who I am? I don't think they do
Then I'll send them a liver to give them a clue
I'll send them a letter and write it in blood and tell them about the things I've done

[Jeffrey Dahmer]
Brings them back, they drink beer, a deadly brew
Eating his boys has their flesh for his food
Gave them money to pose, put a drill in their head
Didn't want them to leave tried to get them into bed

[Ted Bundy]
My name's Ted Bundy and I kill for fun, nobody knows how many I've done
They tried to lock me up but I escaped from that place
And when they killed me I had a smile on my face

[Fred West]
Killed my kids and the people that we had round to stay
Put them under the patio so they couldn't get away

John George Haigh, you can't catch me
One fatal error and guilty is my only plea

Thrity gallons of acid, false teeth of an unkown dweller

Four more again

Gorerotted,"One injection, one infection
One injection and the dead are resurrected
One injection, one infectionm, feasting on the dead

Now there is nowhere left for me to run
The armies af the dead come
Breaking into my place
Their teeth tearing into my face

My blood's now starting to drain
The changes have started in my brain
Awakening as one of them now, killing as I only know how

Staggering, wandering, bludgeoning, murdering, tearing, and feeding on tissue and flesh
My insides and instincts are hungering and thirsting for people with which I can eat and infect
Smearing and smarming and coating whilst laughing my body and clothes in their blood and their bite
Eating and munching on flesh is disgusting but hunger won't go so I kill to survive

One by one the dead arise and stagger around looking for somewhere to feed
Our numbers grow as people change and start chewing on each other's meat
Searching more for victims to gnaw and nibble on to get the strength that we need
Figthting to taste the few that remain before there's nothing left to eat

Infected now there is nowhere else for them to left to run
Our army has gathered the undead have come
Breaking into their blocked off boarded up places
My teeth begin to tear away at their terrified faces
Warm feelings inside as their blood starts to drain
Their changes have started soon they'll rise just the same
Hunting for food that's not there like us in vain

One by one more dead arise, trying to find fresh meat to keep them alive
To many zombies not enough people left, we'll have to move on or soon once again we'll all be dead
Searching more for victims to nibble for strength, but we search and find no one left awake
To many zombies not enough people left, we'll have to move on or soon once again we'll all be dead

Gorilla Biscuits,"Friendship, to you it means nothing
Time and time again you betray friends
With lies, and your gossip
The stories you tell can hurt like hell!

It's your big mouth and it's getting on my nerves
You know I wish you'd just shut it up
It's your big mouth and the shit that comes out
Has nothing to do with what you're talking about

You know I want to trust you but I can't
Your word's not given, it's lent
My advice to you, is to start somewhere
Why don't you shut the fuck up now

It's your big mouth and it's getting on my nerves
You know I wish you'd just shut it up
It's your big mouth and the shit that comes out

Gorilla Biscuits,"Mourning for what? A lost friend I don't need. I never pressured you to live the way that I do You're tied for last in a one man race, You shoved your views in my face. I don't like it!


Why does shit like this tear friends apart, apart - a flip of a coin, that's what you are We must work together and I'm working hard To see the good in everyone I'll see that justice will be done It's my lifestyle that you slag, once my friend now just a drag, A fuckin drag


I'm breaking free of friendships dead, I need your fucking guidance like a hole in the head. You look to me for sympathy, you had your chance, now let me fucking be, Let me be I'm Breaking Free



",Breaking Free
Gorilla Biscuits,"When you're on your high horse
And things are going your way
You really don't appreciate
What you wanted bad yesterday.
But if I lost it-
I'd still be the same
It won't break my spirit-
I'll look ahead just the same
Times are hard it's true- I'll cope
But it won't get me down
Cause I got- High Hopes
When you're on the bottom
The place to look is up
When things are getting better,
Don't stop, don't say enough
What you achieve-
That's for you to choose
You can always-
Regain what you lose
Something shitty happens
And it hurts- I'll cope
It's time we all had- High Hopes
Some people can't rebound
When hardship hits their life
When they lose something they love
And their friend's holding the knife.
Pick your head up, get off the ground
These High Hopes that I have
Keep me from getting down.
",High Hopes
Gorilla Biscuits,"Dedicated to your cause look at all the
Friends you lost. Discarded because I'm
No more use. Our tight friendship is
Hanging loose. Stepping on the people
Who were getting all the things you
Wanted. Now you got them, we're
Forgotten. No need.
For token interest in my life. Don't make
Amends, don't even try. Guilty
Conscience? Maybe not. You just want
More of what I got. Stepping on the
People who were getting all the things you
Wanted. Now you got them, we're
Forgotten.
Try and think why you carry on this way.
It's not you talking, it's your greed I hear.
Nothing means nothing if you're
Insincere.
I don't know why you decide I'm not worth
Calling up. Things have changed between
You and me. We don't hang out but that's
Ok.

Gorilla Biscuits,"What do you mean that it's time, time for me to grow up?
I don't want any part
It's right to follow my heart
The new kids ran, ran out the back door fast
And the bands that came before
They had their noses in the air
Pretending that they care about our scene
Just because our money's green
I'll tell you stage dives make me feel more alive
Than coded messages in slowed down songs
Now you're so ashamed, now I'm so ashamed of you
We believed the same things

You stand to the side, rebirth of hardcore pride
It all came true
Too bad you can't see all the good things that I see
Back in, back in the days
When I'd wait to see the old bands play
It didn't seem like wasted days
I was so sincere, but now I see more clearly
Music's only work to them
It's not to me

So I say hats off to bands that change
Good luck, go your own way
Why play for us if your heart's not in it?
Cause what might, what might seem dumb to you
Is pounding in my heart
Now you're so ashamed, now I'm so ashamed of you
We believe the same things
You stand to the side, rebirth of hardcore pride

It all came true, too bad you can't see, no, you just can't fucking see it
Now you just turn your back
You said I don't want it anymore
Old friends you attack
Our pain out of touch
You don't get it do you
New stage, new ideas
You don't have to make excuses for us

It steals my time and wastes what I've

For something real. You know I'd like to

It left off. How strong's our will?
I can't blend with the ads I see. They're
Better looking than me. You try to look
Your best, but you'll never rest. Think, it
Won't make you happy.

With that. We're made to think life's like a

Who wins.

But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
Elaborath a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road

But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm living in a rush
I don't understand the fuss
My brain is bout to bust

I think I'm losing it
I might be losing it
I just might lose

And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losing it?

I was broke back then,
Now a nigga doing numbers.
Same clothes everyday sleeping on the carpet.
Now I'm sean johned down on the red carpet.

They say fuck em don't even front that boy a 50 sack
When I was fucked you didn't feel bad
The block cut me a check I heard you looking bad.

And stay up late
I can't stop, I won't stop
Shorty its too late

Now we full court press on my own estate.
We used to steal from when dissing when nothing to eat.
Now you can catch me and my hand in these smell meats.

And the chevy strapped up like its fat like big buns.
My phone going ham, niggas leaving stupid messages.
But I ain't mad 'cause the lord keep blessing this.
He kept my mind right, took me through the storm
His soul clear patches nobody lay harm.

Quit your jibbity jabbing man and quit the fucking bullshit.

Gorilla Zoe,"Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
Elaborath a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road

But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm living in a rush
I don't understand the fuss
My brain is bout to bust

I think I'm losing it
I might be losing it
I just might lose

Rollers in the trunk but in the hoods a semi auto
Clip full of hollow they parked the car they don't want no problem
They know who I are, ya fresh from head to toe
Pull a bitch and I'm gone, take her to the room then I drop her back at home

Down lowly
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars
Get on the fame

The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played out
They said the memories
All fade out, fade out, all fade out
Tell me did you feel that?

Don't slow down
Even if it's only to escape
Just down, low down
Before somebody steals your place man

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game

Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on

It's coming on

The essence, the basics
Without, did you make it?
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on

Gorillaz,"[Life]
You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a genie
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B.
'Cause this one's for your radios or whether you receive me

Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya

We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his manger
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls,
We've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol

See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo

[2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver

And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies,
I guess the kids don't live or die

[Si Phili]
'Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it
so people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to refuse it
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi

We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so profound
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the underground
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course

'Cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so appealing
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol
I know you're hearin' me 'cause my voice is clearer than crystal

The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin',
makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm chosen
to rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for

Let Gorillaz be your guiding light and your shining star,
whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car
Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far,
you'll be feelin' entertained be our music repertoire

See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs
'cause Gorllaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars
We rap stars with supernatural spars
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours

So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down
'Cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound

On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat
It's like that when we write raps
We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Gorillaz,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as happy folk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured, as it was, by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence that was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, strange folk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them
They only saw shadows you see, without the truth to the eyes
The happy folk were blind

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

In time, the strange folk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The strange folk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
It's rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world

Meanwhile, down in the town, the happy folk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?

And as the strange folk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain
Holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the happy folk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the monkey would stir from it's deep sleep
Then there came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany so immense
That it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then
Nothing

Oh little town in USA, the time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me out?",Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head

Don't put an English voice
Crashing out into the noise
Electric fences and guns

You swallow me
I'm a pill on your tongue
Here on the nighting floor
The neon lights make me numb

And laid in a stars light
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine
Pick the shit up leave it clean

Kid hang over here
What you're learning in school
Is the rise of an eastern sun
On a big blue for everyone

Was beautiful but nothing really was there",Hong Kong [Live at Manchester Opera House]

It's gonna be a cold day 
When you're keeping everything inside you 
It can only hurt you 

Unrelated sounds 
The sun will shine again 
You hold it in your hands 

This young land is a young land let it stay that way 
Its pollution only turns you into something you don't want to see in the water
A reflection of them that you receive

You don't own the sun
And the sun won't shine again 
So maybe you're all in love 
With Aluminum 

The cling and a clang 
Is the metal in my head when I walk 
I hear a sort of, this tinging noise 
Cling clang 

The cling clang 
So many things happen while walking 
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk 
Freaks my balance out 

So the natural thought 
Is just clogged up 
Totally clogged up 
So we need to unplug these dams 

And make the the natural flow 
It sort of freaks me out 
We need to unplug the dams 
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought 
With a cling and a clang

You hold it in your hands

Ready for retaliation
I change the whole location
To a pine box six-under

Orders given unto me is:
Strike and I'm thunder
With lightning fast reflexes
On constant alert
From the constant hurt
That seems limitless
With no drop in pressure
Seems like everybody's
Out to test ya
'til they see your brake
You can't conceal the hate
That consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu.

Chill with your old lady at the tilt

And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle
Mine's from a canteen

At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life,
It seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert
With my street sweeper
The war is over
So said the speaker
With his flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

Back to the heart of things
No love left to walk back,
Back to the heart of things

So, I'm building above and back
All our city gone red
When I get a call from you,
I'm gonna bid it all true, true

It's so cold when I say goodbye
People holding a meaning, why?
But you never let the car get in
Howling on the sound of swim

Did you want a wind and a
sail it would take a boat
All of infinitive rope
Say what you want, don't bring
Anything back to me

'Cause I'm old, I will say goodbye
Hoping to run out of my lie
If I get a lot from you
I'll make it all come true",Highway (Under Construction)

And then he started grow up faster
Parents wondered what went wrong
And then he turned into a little monster

Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
Calm down, don't kill me now!

Well I didn't expect much more,
Son was a little scallywag-wag-wagger!
Can't see much more
If a lesson I'd guess
I'd hold it straight away
Back to the point, give him three Coca-Colas
And run away
Write on the walls and then litter

So Mama, please let us out on the town
We want to drink, we want to fight
We want it all night
We're gonna smash out your neighbour's car
If you don't let us out that door!

But my mind's much sharper than anybody's!
And that's just a drunk drunk drunker!

I'm still here!
And I'm still walking out!
See you later, ""calm down, don't kill me now!""
I'm gonna get a job
Cause I'm leaving school
Cause I can't do the Clow, the Clow

There's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day
Of another dream

Well you can't get what you want
But you can get me
So let's set up and see
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarine
'Round the world we'll go
Does anybody know
If we're looking out on the day
Of another dream?

If you can't get what you want
Then you come with me

Sits a manatee

In another world,

Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace

We're searching through all the reasons why
And leaving a past memorial

Where the will may, find a way in,
The dials of the moon could steer my way
To love of the future prize

And knocked me up again

Gospel Gangstaz,"No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

The wealth of the wicked is laid up for the righteous partner
Watch me get it
Lifestyles of the rich and saved, homie, watch me live it
Ghetto fabulous till I die, I don't care who like it
Get you excited like you been drinking punch and somebody spiked it

Who's the tightest? We are, 2 G'S and the committee
Revealing and instilling game into the lame 'cause they blind, blind
And can't see, don't blame me, put together a hot deal
Took it to be-right, got some act-right, now I could stack tight
Expedite my life to the next flight

Went from being delinquent to having pockets fatter than cellulite
Show you right, took God's word, locked on it like a pit bull bite
Much love to my homie, untouchable, that's in the pen
If he was home, I know he'd say, ""Chille baby, get your ends""
So I'ma live it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

Represent to the fullest and I love my coast
So it really don't matter on which side I post
Makin' hits that'll last, burning charts like toast
Everybody got a chance, I just do it the most

Keep it real wit me, I'll keep it real wit you
One day we all gone die, Dogg, it's the truth
Lord knows I'm a nut, never would change that
I was brought with a price, now it's all good, black

Homie, money is supreme but it don't rule me
I know the gold diggaz comin', yeah, they don't fool me
Don't wanna go back to the penitentiary
If I do, just might get strike number three

Live it up, so why criticize and you don't pray and do
A million different things I don't have time to get into?
In the hood's where you'll find me but never mind me, continue

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

You'll find my mind's not focused on my problems
I trust God and keep the faith as I'm mobbin'
We fighting goblins like batman and robin'
In Gotham City, cross the committee and we squabblin'

Line lobbin', rhyme throbbin', mind bogglin'
Got your concubines bobbin' while the rhymes lodgin'
Pray to Jehovah Rock like yola and baking soda
And the gray nova exchange rhymes like payola

I stay solar system resistance designed to go the distance
Adding assistance into elevating your existence
Survivalist found my niche, so I switched
And I wish to be raptured or die rich

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

His resurrection made us qualify
But retrospect, low expectation 'cause we were born to die
Read through the text that can answer every question why
Before you flex, interpretation is what tells the lie

Have you been blessed with ears that can truly hear?
Or is it this that you confess but really live in fear?
The end is near, tut closer is the life at hand, the right to stand
Wallow in poverty was not the plan

Since a man died for the cherished promise
You must acknowledge, people perish for a lack of knowledge
Some went to college, A degree but eternity is what they never find
Mad at me, A young G that's enjoyin' mine, don't sleep

I'm tryin' to live it up, do you consider us delirious?
Niggaz hit us up, trust me you don't wanna trip wit us
Have heart to pick it up and take a sip from the bitter cup
Nigga, what? Don't disturb me, I'm in the process of living it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days

Made love in the toronto rain
(i've seen better days)
From hamilton i look the train
(I've seen better days)
What you regret, you softly said are things you never do
I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days

Now i stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned i could have stayed
But i just walked away
I could have done a lot of things

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?

And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

Your shyness leaves your wisdoms on the floor

Gota,"The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Your mamma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror and tell me do you think your life's in danger here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, these were our first
Its just a hand in the bush
A hand in the bush

So now that it's over can't we just say good-bye? (bye-bye, bye-bye)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say

I never wanted it to end this way my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love I think
I'm falling here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
