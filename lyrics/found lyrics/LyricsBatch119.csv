Fightstar,"I know you've got choices to make
I hope you make them well
It only takes a click of the wrist
I hope you live to tell

We cannot build upon over what you are without

And you, you amaze us all
With the hope that you bring
It could save us all
From the war

I know we've got changes to make
I hope we'll see this through
It only takes a slip of the fist
It ends with me and you

We cannot build upon over what you are without the sin
To cross the five stone

And you, you amaze us all
With the hope that you bring
It could save us all
From the war

It all ends with you

You, you amaze us all
With the hope that you bring
It could save us all
From the war

And you, you amaze us all
With the hope that you bring
It could save us all
From the war

",H.I.P. (Enough)
Fightstar,"If you, you are
The bolts that are
Making the Earth spin

Then I have failed
To embrace the touch
Of my own skin

So please
Please make me love
To be better
Than this machine
Has grown to be

If we, we are
The conscience
The roads
That we once walked

So please
Please make me learn
That we're better
Than these machines
Have grown to be

My shadow grabbed me
By the feet and
Grew much taller
Than I am

So please
Please make me learn
That we're better
Than these machines
Have grown to be

So please
Please make me see
That I'm better
Than this machine
Cause now I know

Fightstar,"Some of us will learn
What none of us should know
Smoke will fill this room
There'll be nothing left to show
Hold on to
The ones you love
There will be
Time to show
Enough

We need each other like
Flower pots and dirt
Seven years we spent
Growing from the earth
It's hard to see
How all of this will end
For the consequence
Of broken heart to mend

Stay awake with me
It's getting light outside
When time is still for you it hurries
Stay awake with me
So I can see the sun
Rising up upon your shoulder

People change their ways
When there's nothing left to lose
Coffee talk and crimes
Runs cold blood though our times
You won't recall all your words
But the toughest beats
Will haunt your heart and mind

Stay awake with me
It's getting light outside
When time is still 
For you it hurries
Stay awake with me
So I can see the sun
Rising up upon your shoulder
Stay awake with me
Take this picture
Move your face a little closer
Stay awake with me
Close the window
And stop this room from getting colder

Some of us will learn
What none of us should know
Smoke will fill this room
There'll be nothing left to show

Stay awake with me
It's getting light outside
When time is still, 
For you it hurries
Stay awake with me
So I can see the sun
Rising up upon your shoulder
Stay awake with me
Take this picture
Move your face a little closer
Stay awake with me
Close the window
And stop this room from getting colder
",Unfamiliar Ceilings
Fightstar,"Re-write these words upon my grave
And look down on everything we've loved
Loose lips sink ships and leaders
For this you need to lead us all.

For every change that you've put down on me
I've re-read this stone a hundred times.

Would you stand over these shadows and embrace our history?

We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing
Take the world away from us but
We apologise for nothing.

If I could gather strength a final time
And dream up a war to end all wars
Race lists and mist of vengeance
I don't fear your movements anymore.

Lets celebrate this change in turning tides
This revolution won't be televised.

Would you stand over these shadows and embrace our history?

We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing
Take the world away from us but
We apologise for nothing.

Cut me out of all of this
Cut me out of all of this you say
Just cut me out of all of this
Cut me out of all of this you say.

Would you stand over these shadows and embrace our history?

We apologise for nothing
Take the world away from us but
We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing.

Floods Lyrics
You can't all pretend
That you don't know enough
Enough to make sense
All this will be gone
And you can sink beneath
The rapture we've spawned

What have we become

You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the most of this

Blood will bleed the blind
When the only thing diseased their lives
Let not the sun their lives
On the wrath of this inconvenient truth

What have we become

You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the most of this

Just smile like the idiots you are

You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the most of this",We Apologise for Nothing
Fightstar,"On and off
You told me to wake you up
When the hand reaches the six

I crash over, laying (laying)
My eyes on the road

Help me to hold on to all your foes,
They will be the last ones always

You and I are lost can't save this,
World if we could see the truth through the lies
But you and I will never be the same
Again

On and Off
The ropes in which I upheld
Two lines across your face
For every smile you gave
To me with love

Help me to hold on to all your foes,
They will be the last ones always

You and I are lost can't save this,
World if we could see the truth through the lies
But you and I will never be the same
Again

I beg myself to watch your face
And clear the sin of you away
For love the key will always be disguised

You and I are lost can't save this,
World if we could see the truth through the lies
But you and I will never be the same

Fightstar,"There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Fightstar,"If this is our last feast
Then I refuse to dine alone
So I let the food go cold

As you left this place
Without saying a word
And my shadow grabbed me
By the feet and grew taller than I am

Hold out your arms
Break me inside
Your embrace
Until they arrive

Hold out your arms
Break me inside
Your embrace
And I'll see you when the time comes

Lips are cracked with the bitter cold
As I walk through the crowds
As I stepped in the road
I was hit with the sound of the passenger screen

And all I could feel
Was the blood in my hands
Running down from my head
As the traffic told me to stop

Hold out your arms
Break me inside
Your embrace
Until they arrive

Hold out your arms
Break me inside
Your embrace
And I'll see you when

Don't waste your words
They could be your last
They could be your last
They could be your last

If I am the message

And covered up
Should we keep this open ending

I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry

Go on, go on
Just walk away
Go on, go on
Your choice is made

Go on, go on
And disappear
Go on, go on
Away from here

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you, without you

Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside

Come back, come back
Don't walk away
Come back, come back
Come back today

Come back, come back
What can't you see
Come back, come back
Come back to me

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you, without you

When you sing it's over

For the hearts you break, everytime you moan

Fightstar,"It is cold in here
I can hide behind my breath
Light up and breathe in too much

It goes cold with a gunshot

Drop the light in here
This is goodbye

With mechanical-like arms
And x-ray eyes
And ears to hear your needs

Give me chemical blood so I can
Run faster than the speed of
Light that shines to bleach the color
Of the silver of your honors

Give me your strength so I can
Go further and breathe under water with ease

I am a ghost in the shell
There's nothing left of me
We will always be,
In these machines

Give me chemical blood so I can
Run faster than the speed of
Light that shines to bleach the color
Of the silver of your honors

Give me your strength so I can
Go further and breathe under water with ease
I need a body that I can charge through the walls
Only I can control

You're all pigs in shit
You should just call your mothers out, they'd be so proud of you,
As you celebrate human suffering.

Should we hang them high up under the gallows?
Are we ever going to learn, are you ever going to value this life?

We are privileged, we are all obliged
Just go fuck yourself
I am your sword of Damocles
Get down on your knees, will you have mercy on us please.?

How did we all fall down?

I try to be a witness day by day
Sometimes, it's hard
With Christ's help I will spread the word

That you once knew
Pride is why you're holding back
Torn behind heart and mind

In this world far from home

All right, go and get your storybook
No, no, not one of those, a real story
A real story?
Yes! Tell me about when you were a boy
Well, then, I shall have to take you back with me
A long way in time

It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day
As I walked through the enchanted forest
I heard the sounds of horses and men at arms
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds
And when the forest did clear I was standing on a hill
Before me there was a great plane
Atoned the armies of the world,standing, waiting
I thought to myself, for whom or for what are they waiting?

Suddenly a gust of wind come up from the north
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle axe
From the east came a third, holding a spiked club
And finally, from the west a rider
Who wielded a great hammer of war, with them came their
Soldiers of death, followed by an army of immortals
They were few in number

But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them
That they would leave this day only in victory or death
And there was a great silence
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled the sky with darkness
Rain came and four winds blew with such anger
That I held fast to a tree
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air
Without warning, screaming their war cry they led the attack

Down to the battle they rode
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash
I could feel the groundshake, the earth drank much blood that day
Each of the four, was into himself a whirlwind of doom
When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead
There was much blood and gore
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battle field
Like brown leaves blown by the wind

And I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill
While below them the soldiers of death assembled
All those who would now swear allegiance to them
And the four spoke the words of the warriors prayer
Gods of war I call you, my sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor free from all false pride
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death if I should ever fail
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail,hail

And as I stood and looked on, I heard the armies of the world
Hail them without end, and their voices of victory
Carried long and far throughout the land

Well, That's it, did you like the story?
Yeah, it was great!
Oh, good, I'm glad, now off to bed with you
Grandfather?
Yes?
Who were those four men?
Who were they? They were the Metal Kings

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim

 Eu mesmo mentindo Devo argumentar
 Que isto é bossa nova Que isto é muito natural

Come take me 
To the place of your bereavement
Let me see 
The scars of your allegiance
Well it's good to see
That you're skeptical
That your mind ain't closed
And your heart is cold
Yeah yeah

I'm gonna make you wait
I'm gonna liberate
This dream ends now
I'm gonna fascinate
I'm gonna change your fate
This dream ends now

Come with me
If you want to see the real thing
Let me lead
You'll see what keeps you breathing
And it's good to see
When you look at me
And that I'm the one
To the tenth degree

Finbar Furey,"Oh, Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
With people here working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes, nor barley nor wheat
But there' gangs of them digging for gold in the streets
At least when I asked them that's what I was told
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I found there I might as well be
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea. 
I believe that when writin' a wish you expressed
As to how the fine ladies in London were dressed
Well, if you believe me, when asked to a ball
Faith, they don't wear no top to their dresses at all.
Oh, I've seen them myself and you could not in trath
Say if they were bound for a ball or a bath
Don't be startin' them fashions now, Mary Macree,
Where the mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea. 

I've seen England's king from the top of a bus
And I've never known him, but he means to know us.
And tho' by the Saxon we once were oppressed,
Still I cheered, God forgive me, I cheered with the rest.
And now that he's visited Erin's green shore
We'll be much better friends than we've been heretofore
When we've got all we want, we're as quiet as can be
Where the mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea. 

You remember young Peter O'Loughlin, of course
Well, now he is here at the head of the force
I met him today, I was crossing the Strand
And he stopped the whole street with a wave of his hand
And there we stood talkin' of days that are gone
While the whole population of London looked on
But for all these great powers he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea. 

There's beautiful girls here, oh, never you mind
With beautiful shapes nature never designed
And lovely complexions all roses and cream
But O'Loughlin remarked with regard to the same
That if at those roses you venture to sip
The colours might all come away on your lip
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waitin' for me
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.

What did I expect, did I see forever in you?

I never want it to hurt more than it should
I hope you're satisfied, I never could

Time to close my eyes, forget about this mess
And try to fix this tragic loss of innocence

When everything is dead?

I never want it to hurt more than it should

There with open arms

I'm gone?
Where do you run to
So far away?

I want you to know that
I miss you, I miss you so
I want you to know that
I miss you, I miss you so

I'm writing again
These letters to you aren't much I know
But I'm not sleeping and you're not here

Now I am stealing her body and taking it home.
There is always one more fault.

Run with me, you take the lead
I forget the world silently

You're sailing on, that's okay
I'll learn to swim someday

Stupid, there's no common ground
It's too late for apologies
It's too late for this mess you've made again

I've hit the ground and I'm running

You should be allowed but you were beat out

'Til your dreams hold mine
Just stay until we know we tried one more time

Can it stay here for us, for now?

Can it stay until we know ourselves?

I'm so far into your story I don't know why

When we lie between the lines

We'll find a line to follow
It's got to show real soon
Or we'll never each this high

We climb a little further
'Cause there's nothing we can't get around together
Further gets colder until nothing was all that I saw around

If I can hold onto this feeling this long
Maybe I can get you to hold me

At least you changed the world for me

I won't be sorry if you leave me girl
Cause I'm the world's biggest fan of clichés
I'll set you free then I'll love like I'm not
Hurting in the world's worst ways

And I don't have much more left to lose
I can't say for sure just where I'll end up

And my world's crashing in
And it starts to turn again

Who can you trust from hear, sweet flower, who can you trust?

Feriscono solo me

Non è facile per me ma sento che

Hanno reso un po' più dolci

So farlo senza di voi

So unreal? 

Breeze is cold, the taste of winter 
Long and sad just like a faithless death 
But my sun can make things better 
Shine over me, shine over me? 

[Chorus]
All the things that you do 
Bring to me something new 
A continuous surprise 
You have colored my life 
Like an uncommon ray 
You make the world so less gray 
And I'll never, 
Never let you go away 

You have taught me that all beauties live inside 
In a smile, in a red bug and in a rhyme 
For the small things now I wonder like a child 
Shine over me, shine over me? 

[Chorus]

Delicate and so fine 
Is your touch, ray of light 
Phantoms of my darkest life 
Are terrified by your brightness 
Don't go away, I need your rays 
Shine over me? 

[Chorus]

I'll never let you go my ray of light 
I'll never let you go my ray of light",Ray of Light
Finley,"Quasi blu metallici
Quasi come elettrici
Quegli occhi che
Ricordo anche se
Non li ho visti mai

Forse solo dentro ai miei
Sogni che forse dovrei
Spiegarti se
Non fosse che tu
Non ci crederai

Perché nemmeno io
Riesco a credere che un Dio
Si sia un po' distratto
Perdendo un angelo
Davanti a me

Ma ormai già che sei qui
Ma ormai già che è così
Non ritornare a casa
O almeno portami con te
Scegli me

Quasi blu metallici
Quasi come elettrici
Quegli occhi che
Ricordo e forse
Non rivedrò mai

Ma non volare via
Ti prego, cambia idea
Non ritornare a casa
O almeno portami con te
Scegli me

Tu, dal cielo un angelo
Ascolta il mio respiro
E scegli me

Mai, nemmeno un attimo
Ti pentirai se adesso
Scegli me

Stai sentendo il battito
Di un cuore che ti chiede
Scegli me

",Scegli Me
Finley,"Her chant, a hot desire 
She adds fuel to the fire 
By now I have no self possession 

Outside a pure attraction 
Inside a cruel intention 
She's worse than anybody else 

""Come to me"" 
I'm drowning, I'm drowning 
""Follow me"" 
I'm drowning, I'm drowning 

Hearing tiny voices inside my head 
Confusing words that I can't understand 
""I'll never let you go 
I'll never let you go away from me"" 
""I'll never let you go 
I'll never let you go away 
From these hypnotic chains"" 

Just like my pretty siren 
You tease me with your lips 
Your tongue repeats her lullaby 

""Come to me"" 
I'm drowning, I'm drowning 
""Follow me"" 
I'm drowning, I'm drowning 

Hearing tiny voices inside my head 
Confusing words that I can't understand 
""I'll never let you go 
I'll never let you go away from me"" 
""I'll never let you go 
I'll never let you go away 
From these hypnotic chains"" 

Maybe you are stronger than me now 
But the fairy tale you wrote is fading out 

You make me so angry now! 
( I'm getting off my chest ) 
You make me so angry now! 
( I'm getting off my chest )

Disperso tra le onde
Di un mare che non mi da pace

Non cercare di resistere
Ho già distrutto

Li hai spazzati via

Gente immersa nell'ipocrisia
Manca ossigeno nell'aria
Senza te

Come il sole di settembre
Quando ormai
L'estate se ne va
Sei tu l'ultima speranza
L'Unica x me, unica x me

Vivo solo di te
Di ogni gesto che fai
Di quegli attimi che
Tu soltanto mi dai
Ogni giorno di più
Sai convincermi che
Nulla avrebbe senso
Se non fossi qui
Con me

Mi hai insegnato che
Un sorriso illumina
Ogni istante grigio
Della nostra età
Non un'ora un giorno
Ma un' eternità
Ti vorrei con me
Ti vorrei con me

Vivo solo di te
Di ogni gesto che fai
Di quegli attimi che
Tu soltanto mi dai
Ogni giorno di più
Sai convincermi che
Nulla avrebbe senso
Se non fossi qui

Io non so che mi fai
Io per te morirei
Spettri di quei giorni bui
Spariscono col tuo sguardo
Stringimi e resta qui
Qui con me

Vivo solo di te
Del calore che dai
La tua luce per me
Non si spegnerà mai
Ogni giorno di più
Sai convincermi che
Nulla avrebbe senso
Se non fossi qui

Non posso
Restare senza di te
Un raggio di luce
Tu sei per me

Hoping to catch your reflection again
Missing all the real life action

Put the powder on and climb the slippery stairs
Inside a sleazy room with a bible for companion
Bleeding fingernail, you'll never know yourself

Finn Brothers,"At the shopping mall I'm surrounded by a parking lot
Walking down the aisle I was thinking about what I had lost
On a Sunday morning my hometown is feeling strange to me
In the stadium dark forces are gathering

Homesick, for the people that I live with
Homesick, for the spirit I'm missing
Homesick, for the country that I'm living in

First you make me hungry
Then you feed me something I don't want
There's no satisfaction for an aching heart but life goes on
And when I complain I get thrown out of the restaurant

Homesick, for the people that I live with
Homesick, for the spirit I'm missing
Homesick, for the country that I'm living in

Homesick, for the people that I live with

I'm the same as you 
In so many things

But to both of us 
That will never change 

And we're staring at 
Each other

A river

Any closer

Like I own the place

Finn Brothers,"I know that it's you behind
Everything that I do
And I wouldn't try to hide
Who I am from you

It's all me that you see
I was ready for another try
But I needed you to set me free
Must be the luckiest man alive

Man finds love in his life
He's the luckiest man alive
Someone true by his side
He's the luckiest man alive
Once you cut right through
His foolish pride
He's the luckiest man alive

I've never had the time before
Leaving things where they fell
I was going door to door
Always thinking I was somewhere else

You saw me and what I could be
And now I know what love is for
It's the only thing sets you free
Must be the luckiest man alive

Man finds love in his life
He's the luckiest man alive
Someone true by his side
He's the luckiest man alive
She cut right through
His foolish pride
He's the luckiest man alive

Feel the motion, it's an endless ocean
Rocking gently and moving deeply
Feels like always been knocked sideways
Over and over by the strength of your love

Man finds love
Man finds love in his eyes
He's the luckiest man alive
Someone true
Man finds love
He's the luckiest man alive

Finn Brothers,"It's a slow parade
Down a dusty road
We've learned to take abuse
From devils we don't know

People who have lost all heart
Look for someone else to blame
You just keep on walking
When they call you a dirty name

All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you

You shake it off
'Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
There's nothing wrong with you

The moment that we dread
It comes all too soon
Voices in your head
Still carry on the tune

Let the sound come in
From the world outside
You just keep on singing
When they tell you filthy lies

All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you

You shake it off
'Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
There's nothing wrong with you

Remember how it made you hurt
Even as you fight to go on
Turn it into something else
Turn it into something else

None of it sticks on you

You shake it off
'Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
No, you don't believe it

Finn Brothers,"Over these green hills, blue electric light
Always in my blood, forever in my eyes
Black window space a basket made of flax
Broken mirror view, let your eyes relax

Mist on my glass
Watch it all come to pass
Once again, we'll breathe in the view
It's part of me, part of you

Now my voice won't sing and my tears won't cry
Your disciple waits for any good advice
Our place in time, it's not set in stone
And we'll still be here where the cows come home

Mist on my glass
Watch it all come to pass
Once again, we'll breathe in the view
It's part of me, part of you

And it has to be clear, inside my head
And I'm still in a dream, in a dream that won't end
Once again, we'll breathe in the view
It's part of me, part of you

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday

(Hey!)
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live

Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me, empty like before

(Hey!)
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we run)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?

Fiona Apple,"I've been a bad, bad girl
I've been careless with a delicate man
And it's a sad, sad world
When a girl will break a boy just because she can

Don't you tell me to deny it
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins
I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true
And I just don't know where I can begin

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Heaven help me for the way I am
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done
I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
But I keep living this day like the next will never come

Oh help me but don't tell me to deny it
I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'till I'm good enough for him
I've got a lot to lose and I'm bettin' high so I'm begging you
Before it ends just tell me where to begin

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Let me know the way
Before there's hell to pay
Give me room to lay the law and let me go
I've got to make a play
To make my lover stay
So what would an angel say the devil wants to know

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

I'll know, I'll know

And you can use my skin
To bury your secrets in
And I will settle you down

But all the time all the time
I'll know I'll know

Baby-I can't help you out,
While she's still around
For the time being, 
I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don't make sense
All the time give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtains,
I'll wait by the backstage door

The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for a encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait

See myself something different
Though I try to talk sense to myself
But I just won't listen

Won't you go away
Turn yourself in
You're no good at confession
Before the image that you burned me in
Tries to teach you a lesson

What you did to me made me see myself somethin' awful
A voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled
It took me such a long time to get back up the first time you did it
I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems I've been outbidded

My peace and quiet was stolen from me
When I was looking with calm affection
You were searching out my imperfections

What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff

You came upon me like a hypnic jerk
When I was just about settled
And when it counts you recoil
With a cryptic word and leave a love belittled

Oh what a cold and common low way to go
When I was feeding on the need for you to know me
Devastated at the rate you fell below me

What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff

Fionn Regan,"The horses are asleep with heavy eyes that close.
In dreams they trace the path by which the river flows.
Let spirit now align with the estuary.
As nightfall's open mouth howls out to the sea.

It starts with a kick then, hips align vertically. 
Muscle and bone assemble.
The carriage of her arms breaks free.
I douse this bullrush with petrol from a can.
And into the forest with it lit I ran.
I'm a man. 
I'm a man. 
I'm a man, with a child's heart

The horses are asleep, the stable door will lock.
Count the hours you keep on a ballerina clock.
Let spirit now align the current of the breeze. 
As nightfall's open mouth howls out through the trees.

Guiding us out of the woods.
Lover, lover, lover you are,
Are a north star, burning.

She shifts her weight to the other foot,
Asks me how deep I'd like the cut,
Sharpening her words.

He kicks out the door wedge,
And walks her to the ledge,
Points out to the ocean.

I hear that you're living in, that house out by the lake.
Things that fall together, just as easily break.
I'm not looking back though.

Lover, lover, lover you are,
Guiding us out of the woods.
Lover, lover, lover you are,
Are a north star, burning.

Ah, ah
Ah, ah

We wrestle with the tide,
Till there was nowhere to hide,
Laid bare on the rocks.

Things came into focus sharp,
With the morning came a spark,
That lit the fuse for sorrow.

I hear that you're living in, that house out by the lake
Somewhere down the road, beside you I wish to wake,
I'm not looking back though.

Lover, lover, lover you are,
Guiding us out of the woods.
Lover, lover, lover, you are,
Are a north star, lover.

Lay your head, on the river bed.
The tears we shed, gonna burst the bank.

Guiding us out the woods.

Guiding us out of the woods.

Fionnuala Gill,"Midnights in winter, the glowing fire
Lights up your face in orange and gold
I see your sweet smile shine through the darkness
It's line is etched in my memory, so I'd know you by heart

Mornings in April, sharing our secrets
We'd walk until the morning was gone
We were like children, laughing for hours
The joy you gave me lives on and on 'cause I know you by heart

I still hear your voice on warm summer nights
Whispering like the wind

You left in autumn, the leaves were turning
I walked down roads of orange and gold
I saw your sweet smile, I heard your laughter
You're still beside me everyday 'cause I know you by heart

Fiordaliso,"Certo sarebbe bello
E lo sai che anch'io vorrei
Quando restiamo al buio
Nei tuoi occhi fuggirei

Come ci starei qui vicino a te
Cosa ti farei se restassi qui
Come ci starei vicino a te
Ma e' tardi e lo sai

E' un fuoco e tu lo sai
Il pensiero che mi dai
Ma il cuore che c'è in lui lo sai
E il mare che vorrei

Come ci starei

Facile e'facile
E poi, per quanto resterai
Facile e' facile
E dopo tu cosa dirai
Come ci starei

So che mi soffieresti aria
E che poi sospirerei
So che volerei
Come non ho fatto mai

Come ci starei
Facile e' facile
Come ci starei

Io conosco la mia vita e ho visto il mare
E ho visto l'amore da poterne parlare

Che e' già un ritorno
Amore senza rimpianto 
E senza confronto
Che conosci la tua vita 
Ma non hai visto il mare
E non hai l'amore per poterne parlare

In questa notte da soli 
Che non ci si puo' vedere
E non ci si puo' contare

E ho visto l'amore vicino da poterlo toccare

Fiorella Mannoia,"Sally cammina per la strada senza nemmeno, guardare per terra
Sally è una donna che non ha più voglia, di fare la guerra
Sally ha patito troppo,
Sally ha già visto che cosa, ti può crollare addosso!
Sally è già stata punita
Per ogni sua distrazione o debolezza
Per ogni candida carezza
Data per non sentire l'amarezza!

Senti che fuori piove
Senti che bel rumore.
Sally cammina per la strada sicura
Senza pensare a niente
Ormai guarda la gente con aria indifferente.
Sono lontani quei momenti
Quando uno sguardo provocava turbamenti
Quando la vita era più facile
E si potevano mangiare anche le fragole
Perché la vita è un brivido che vola via
È tutto un equilibrio sopra la follia
Sopra la follia!

Senti che fuori piove, senti che bel rumore.
Ma forse Sally è proprio questo il senso, il senso del tuo vagare
Forse davvero ci si deve sentire alla fine un po' male!
Forse alla fine di questa triste storia qualcuno troverà il coraggio
Per affrontare i sensi di colpa e cancellarli da questo viaggio
Per vivere davvero ogni momento
Con ogni suo turbamento e come se fosse l'ultimo!

Sally cammina per la strada leggera
Ormai è sera
Si accendono le luci dei lampioni
Tutta la gente corre a casa, corre davanti alle televisioni.

Ed un pensiero le passa per la testa
Forse la vita non è stata tutta persa
Forse qualcosa si è salvato
Forse davvero non è stato tutto sbagliato
Forse era giusto così
Eh forse, ma forse, ma sì

Cosa vuoi che ti dica
Senti che bel rumore.",Sally

all'improvviso senza accorgerti, la vivrai, ti sorprenderà. 
Ne abbiamo avute di occasioni 
perdendole; non rimpiangerle, non rimpiangerle mai.

Mi avveleni la mente 
Un filo azzurro di luce 

Scappa dalle serrande 
E cerco invano qualcosa 
Da inventare in mutande 
Un'automobile passa 
E una mosca vola bassa 
Mi ronza gira gira 
Ma sbaglio la mira 
Vorrei cercare qualche cosa 
Da fare fuori 
E camminare senza orgoglio 
Darsi a un rubacuori 
Ma io come Giuda 
So vendermi nuda

Attirarti nel bosco 
Attirarti nel bosco attirarti 
Voci di strada all'orecchio 
Tutto è poco eccitante

Ma scappero' via di qui 
Da questa casa galera 
Che mi fa prigioniera 
Con gli occhi chiusi 

A mille miglia per conto mio 
Odio la sveglia che mi sveglia

Ma io come Giuda 
So vendermi nuda 
Da sola sul letto

Che è forte come il caffe'

Oh no non voglio star qui 
E poi mi fermo 
Per guardarmi un istante

Sono tante 
Un ballo in cucina 
E sono ancora bambina 

Un pranzo da sposa

E questa voglia che non passa

i saxes, ipnotizzati dai movimenti di lei si spandevano
rumori di gomma e di vernice, da lui di cuoio

le luci saettavano sul volto pechinese della cassiera
che fumava al mentolo, altri sternutivano senza malizia
e la canzone andava elegante, l'orchestra era partita, decollava
i musicisti, un tutt'uno col soffitto e il pavimento,
solo il batterista nell'ombra guardava con sguardi cattivi

quei due danzavano bravi, una nuova cassiera sostituiva la prima,
questa qui aveva gli occhi da lupa e masticava caramelle alascane,

e questa luna che muore sulla mia testa di soldato 
e questo cielo che cambia colore, questo cammino segnato 
Ah se ti avessi guardato 

Però ho visto la Francia dalla neve al mare 
e sul piatto della bilancia la mia vita pesare 
e le colombe e i serpenti e gli sciocchi ed il rosso ed il nero 
e questo l'ho cantato con la voce che avevo 

Però ho visto il mio destino la mia stella di ragazza 
sanguinare e bagnarsi sotto la mia corazza 
e dicono che una notte abbia sentito una canzone 
una voce che mi chiamava e che diceva il mio nome",Giovanna d'Arco

Qualche giorno non mi sbaglio

Le colline, le vetrine 
La mia stanza da imbiancare 
Questa faccia che va bene già com'è. 
Guardo in faccia il sole 
Fino a lacrimare 
Fino a che... si vedrà 
Chi per primo abbassa gli occhi

Se si parla un po' d'amore

Qualcuno mi è solo sembrato

Fiorella Mannoia,"Non m'addormaento
Se non avevo certe favole fantastiche
E la mattina dopo
Trovavo il mondo ancora mio
Per poco
Non mi confondevo
Se non vi vedevo ancora pronti per discutere
E mi sembrava un gioco
Chiedere sorridendo poi
Datevi un bacio, un bacio, dai
E andavo via
Ma mi faceva compagnia
Ogni parola che sentivo pronunciare a casa mia
Avevo già tutte le mie curiosità
Ma non sapevo di dolori, poesie, difficoltà
Non avevo limiti
E parlavo agli angeli.

Non vi comprendevo
Se dicevate che domani
Sarei stata io
Quella che se ne andava
E intanto il mondo accanto a voi cambiava
Se vi giudicavo
Usavo il metro dell'amore e della logica
E intanto mi aspettava
La grande confusione che
La vita avrebbe fatto in me

C'è un giorno poi
Che non è tutto come vuoi
Tra le persone che non possono restare più con noi
E sento già
Crescere dentro un'ansietà
Per non sapere immaginare il peso della realtà
Ma non ci sono limiti
Per parlare agli angeli

Fiorella Mannoia,"Dicono che c'è un tempo per seminare
E uno che hai voglia ad aspettare
Un tempo sognato che viene di notte
E un altro di giorno teso
Come un lino a sventolare.
 
C'è un tempo negato e uno segreto
Un tempo distante che è roba degli altri
Un momento che era meglio partire
E quella volta che noi due era meglio parlarci.
 
C'è un tempo perfetto per fare silenzio
Guardare il passaggio del sole d'estate
E saper raccontare ai nostri bambini quando
È l'ora muta delle fate.
 
C'è un giorno che ci siamo perduti
Come smarrire un anello in un prato
E c'era tutto un programma futuro
Che non abbiamo avverato.
 
È tempo che sfugge, niente paura
Che prima o poi ci riprende
Perché c'è tempo, c'è tempo c'è tempo, c'è tempo
Per questo mare infinito di gente.
 
Dio, è proprio tanto che piove
E da un anno non torno
Da mezz'ora sono qui arruffato
Dentro una sala d'aspetto
Di un tram che non viene
Non essere gelosa di me
Della mia vita
Non essere gelosa di me
Non essere mai gelosa di me.
 
C'è un tempo d'aspetto come dicevo
Qualcosa di buono che verrà
Un attimo fotografato, dipinto, segnato
E quello dopo perduto via
Senza nemmeno voler sapere come sarebbe stata
La sua fotografia.
 
C'è un tempo bellissimo tutto sudato
Una stagione ribelle
L'istante in cui scocca l'unica freccia
Che arriva alla volta celeste
E trafigge le stelle
È un giorno che tutta la gente
Si tende la mano
È il medesimo istante per tutti
Che sarà benedetto, io credo
Da molto lontano
È il tempo che è finalmente
O quando ci si capisce
Un tempo in cui mi vedrai
Accanto a te nuovamente
Mano alla mano
Che buffi saremo
Se non ci avranno nemmeno
Avvisato.

Fiorella Mannoia,"Ho imparato a sognare,
Che non ero bambino
Che non ero neanche un'età
Quando un giorno di scuola
Mi durava una vita
E il mio mondo finiva un po là
Tra quel prete palloso
Che ci dava da fare
E il pallone che andava
Come fosse a motore
C'era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già

Ho imparato a sognare
E ho iniziato a sperare
Che chi c'ha avere avrà
Ho imparato a sognare
Quando un sogno è un cannone,
Che se sogni
Ne ammazzi metà

Quando inizi a capire
Che sei solo e in mutande
Quando inizi a capire
Che tutto è più grande
C' era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già

Tra una botta che prendo
E una botta che dò
Tra un amico che perdo
E un amico che avrò
Che se cado una volta
Una volta cadrò
E da terra, da lì m'alzerò
C'è che ormai che ho imparato a sognare non smetterò

Ho imparato a sognare,
Quando inizi a scoprire
Che ogni sogno
Ti porta più in là
Cavalcando aquiloni,
Oltre muri e confini
Ho imparato a sognare da là
Quando tutte le scuse,
Per giocare son buone
Quando tutta la vita
È una bella canzone
C'era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già

Fiorella Mannoia,"Il silenzio imbarazzato
Di chi sa di non tornare
La lasciò senza parole.
Della porta che si chiuse
Non sentì neanche il rumore
Tanto forte era il suono del suo rancore.
Per guardarsi nello specchio
Mise l'abito migliore
Perché fosse più elegante il suo dolore.
Da quello che le ha sputato addosso
Perché non ha detto
Perché non ha fatto
Ora si sente soffocare.
Quando si comincia a recriminare
È il momento in cui si sta per sparire.

Riposa
Che il sogno
Ti dona

Così pensò al loro primo incontro
Alla magia di quell'incanto
Alla sua gioia elementare
Alle grida di piacere
Soffocate dal cuscino
Quando un gesto primitivo
Si fa divino
E a quella esaltazione del presente
Di un amore che ancora non ti ha chiesto niente
Niente da sacrificare.
Poi del lasciarsi il solito rituale
Dove ogni uomo diventa così banale.

Come quando tu mi guardi e non rispondo
Come quando come sempre sempre aspetti
Come quando guardi solo i tuoi difetti

Le tue ragioni fanno male, 
Come sei brava tu a colpire
Quante parole sai trovare, mentre io non so che dire
Le tue parole sono mine, 
Le sento esplodere in cortile, 
Al posto delle margherite, ora 
Ci sono cariche esplosive
Due lunghe e romantiche vite divise
Da queste rime. 

Le tue labbra stanno male, lo so, 
Non hanno labbra da mangiare, 
Oh ma la fame d'amore la si può

Sì, che fanno male, fanno sanguinare, 
Ma non morire!

Fiorella Mannoia,"Ci penso da lontano da un altro mare un'altra casa che non sai 
La chiamano speranza ma a volte è un modo per dire illusione 
Ci penso da lontano e ogni volta è come avvicinarti un po' 
Per chi ha l' anima tagliata l'amore è sangue, futuro e coraggio 

A volte sogni di navigare su campi di grano 
E nei ritorni quella bellezza resta in una mano 
E adesso che non rispondi fa più rumore nel silenzio il tuo pensiero 
E tu da li mi sentirai se grido 
Io non ho paura 
Il tempo non ti aspetta 

Ferisce questa terra dolce e diffidente 
Ed ho imparato a comprendere l'indifferenza 
Che ti cammina accanto 
Ma le ho riconosciute in tanti occhi le mie stesse paure 
Ed aspettare è quel segreto che vorrei insegnarti 
Matura il frutto e il tuo dolore non farà più male e adesso alza lo sguardo 
Difendi con l'amore il tuo passato 
Ed io da qui ti sentirò vicino 
Io non ho paura 

E poi lasciarti da lontano rinunciare 
Anche ad amare come se l'amore fosse clandestino 
Fermare gli occhi un istante e poi sparare in mezzo al cielo il tuo destino 
Per ogni sogno calpestato ogni volta

Abbraccia questo vento e sentirai che il mio respiro è più sereno

Arriva Sonni Boi con I cavalli di legno
E la sua donna Fortuna
I denti di ferro e gli occhi neri puntati
Nel cielo per capirne I misteri.
È nato a Ferrara anzi l'hanno trovato su un muro
È pieno di segni e I muscoli
Corrono sulla sua pelle.

Sonni Boi ha disegnato sulle braccia
La mappa delle stelle.
Di notte va a caccia e con il cavallo
Raccoglie chi si è perduto
Anch'io quante volte da bambino ho chiesto aiuto
Quante volte da solo mi sono perduto
Quante volte ho pianto e sono caduto
Guardando le stelle ho chiesto di capire
Come entrare nel mondo dei grandi
Senza paura paura di morire
Come uno zingaro seduto su un muro
Gli occhi nel cielo puntati sul futuro

Dei suoi mille figli non ricorda un viso
Ne ha avuto uno per coltello
Ha fatto un figlio per ogni nemico ucciso.
Sonni Boi non è cattivo ha perfino sorriso guardando
Fortuna accarezzandole il viso.
Li ho visti abbracciarsi come bimbi nel parco della luna
Tutti e due con una valigia nella mano
Con l'aria di chi deve partire
E andare lontano oppure morire,
In silenzio, sparire piano piano

Sulle grandi ali colorate

Fire From the Gods,"Look what I’ve found, come get down
It’s that revolution sound
Call it second emancipation, break these chains and let me out
It’s not violence I’m on about, but riot boots still hit the ground
Lower the gun put down the whip
Take a step back hear me out
I am fanatic, employ guerilla tactics
Open up this lyrical automatic and put holes in your rhetoric
It’s archaic, kind of chaotic, almost barbaric
But yet you stand and you swear by it
And I’ve been readily, steadily waiting for a chance to resist
The devil is a liar, topple the empire
Blood sweat tears and desire
I put my heart into this
Never forget I’m a soldier
I will not be conquered

I can’t walk this road forever, and I can’t forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It’s destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it’s killing me

Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, equality and justice for all
Now you know you lying

You on that shotgun philosophy, celebrate the tragedy
Build an effigy high to the heavens to remind me and blind me
Turn the whole world into my enemy
Control my destiny and drain all my energy
It’s insane to me
Got the whole nation sedated and medicated
A testimony to the violence
Yet you still give me that ghetto education
Basically priming me to feed me to the prison industry
I see all of the cowards, the greed, the need to hold control over me
Break these chains, end the power
I’d rather you give back what you stole from me

I can’t walk this road forever, and I can’t forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It’s destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it’s killing me

Excuse me Mister officer, come out of my sector
No need to stress, no need for vex

Ah, ah, ey
Yo, excuse me your honor, fuck the drama
No apologies, I save that for my mama
Take my name off of the docket
Drop all these charges
All it took was a spark, all it took was a catalyst
Martin said it best, I live a life with no violence
So I speak up, no longer silent
I begin to see
My third eye is opening
And my resolve is strengthening
I yearn to be free

I can’t walk this road forever, and I can’t forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It’s destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it’s killing me

Excuse me Mister officer no need for war
Trying to drain my energy, but you can’t keep me down

Firefall,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

You and me my friend?
I see you've fallen down,
Turned around again.

Always stand by you.

But I don't get it,
Why do you do it?
But I don't get it,
Why do you do it?

Doing it all on your own.

Fireflight,"In the mirror is where I find you,
Longing to be free.
If only you could find truth,
Who you want to be.
When I look into your eyes,
Is it me you really see?
Or is it cloudy through your lies,
Can I still be free?

Open your eyes,
I see right through them.
Half-truths and lies,
Is all its ever been.
You justify,
But I'm tired of the truth.
That you don't think I know.
Sharp words find their way smooth,
Slippery off your tongue.

They never see it coming,
Your sword beneath your cloak.

To the hearts that you've broke.",Reflections

Want to be, want to be, want to be true.
Nothing left, nothing left, left to prove,
But show them who You are.

I live for You,
There's nothing You cannot do.
You lift me up high,
You spread my wings to touch the sky.
You are there, You are there, when I'm against the wall,
You can make the mighty, mighty, mighty fall.
You're the One, the One, the One who made it all,
I see you every where.

Jesus said it better and He didn't have to shout.
Maybe if you change it you can get your way.
Just rearrange it and you can get paid.

A little more money comes in every day.
Faith and five dollars goes a long way.
Look at your pockets filled up with gold
But what's in your heart is making you cold.

And it's God bless you.
Because it's what you want.
And all our dreams come true.
When you get what you want.

All that I see when you start to cry.
Is the rock on your finger and gleam in your eye.
Your sad story is making me sick.
So change the channel cause it's getting thick.

But you'll say anything as long as you're paid.
Look for their weakness you feed on their need

The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Than some pathetic, lame aesthetic stolling rone is famous for
Push the drawer closed, grab a firehose, point it at the door
Get it all wet, remember, forget what rock & roll is for
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you're fishing for a mission way beyond the door
First you dream, next you're scheming, searching through your drawer
For an oar for your trip bound for yet uncharted shores

Don't walk away
(Well) Don't leave and break my heart

Never too late to say we're sorry and try another way
I'm down on my knees, I need you baby
Don't walk away

Now we've both done things that we regret
We could learn to forgive and forget
We'll make it better, give it another try
Baby, don't give up, don't give in

Walkin' away won't solve anything
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do to keep you satisfied

Don't throw it all away

Can't get enough without your love; I'm helpless
I need so much without your touch; I'm helpless
I want you so, don't let me go; I'm helpless

We'd take our time and live our lives together day by day

With you I never wonder, You're the right one for me

I finally found the love of a lifetime
A love to last my whole life through
I finally found the love of a lifetime
Forever in my heart, I finally found the love of a lifetime

With every kiss our love is like brand-new
And every star up in the sky was made for me and you
Still we both know that the road is long
(But) We know that we will be together

[Chorus:]
Tryin' to make a livin', gotta pay the rent
(just) tryin' to make a livin', wonder where my money went
Never seem to get ahead, it's getting' easier to see
(just) tryin' to make a livin' and it's killing me

Times are getting tough seems I never make enough
Just doing what I can to stay alive
And I'd like to take a day off but I can't afford a layoff
Gotta keep this damn job to survive

Can't make ends meet I can't even save a dime
Feels like I spend my life working overtime

Firehouse,"One man is black, one man is white
One works by the light of the day and the other one works at night
They both live so differently but they are so much alike
They both want the very same thing just to have a better way of life

You know you can't take sides 'cause no one's wrong or right
So don't make up you mind take another look before you decide

[Chorus:]
'Cause there are two sides to every story
Two different ways of looking at exactly the same thing
Two sides to every story
So don't make up your mind 'til ya hear the story from me

One nation's weak, one nation's strong
Two people side by side but they just can't get along
All war's too big ya know, no war's too small
One wants just a little piece and the other one wants it all

You know you can't take sides 'cause no one's wrong or right
So don't make up you mind take another look before you decide

Don't make up you mind there are two sides you'll see
Oh so let me tell it to you straight you gotta open up your eyes
You'll see perspective's everything and you just might change your mind

Firehouse,"Brother please don't turn your back on me
I was once just like you but I've fallen through the cracks of society
Why can't anyone just lend a hand
Doesn't anybody care, doesn't someone understand
We should be ashamed because we lay the blame
Not on ourselves but on this day and age

[Chorus]
What's wrong with everybody
Why can't anybody get along
Well I think we've got a problem
We've got to help each other out or we'll never figure out
What's wrong with everybody

Five o'clock another traffic jam
All lanes merge to one and it seems like no one gives a damn
Why can't we just let each other in
But we cut each other off and we just keep on driving

We should be ashamed because we lay the blame
Not on ourselves but on this day and age

[Chorus]

Why can't everyone just live in peace
Well we've got to pull together and put an end to this insanity
Why can't everyone just lend a hand
Doesn't anybody care, doesn't someone give a damn

Firehouse,"So you think you've got it all figured out
Well you know you can't make it alone
Everybody needs somebody to help them out
And you know I could be that someone

And if you ever get lost on life's highway
Don't know where to go
There's just one thing that I want you to know

I am here for you, always here for you
When you need a shoulder to cry on
Someone to rely on, I am here for you

So you think that love is long overdue
Tired of looking for someone to care
Let me tell you now the choice is up to you
But you know I will always be there

I am here for you, always here for you
When you're needin' someone to hold you
Remember I told you
I am here for you
I am here for you 

So now you've got it all figured out
And you know you've found someone that cares
And if you ever need somebody to help you out
Well you know I will always be there

And I could never see, the two of us apart

1-I've built my world around you and I want you to know
I need you, like I've never needed anyone before

2-I live my life for you
I want to be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true
I live my life for you

I dedicated my life to you
You know that I would die for you
But our love would last forever
And I will always be with you
And there is nothing we can't do
As long as we're together

I just can't live without you, and I want you to know
I need you like I've never needed anyone before

Firehouse,"Seems I just can't do enough
I could never win your love
Why should I try
When you never share your feelings?
How could I be so naive? 
Is it so hard to believe
That you excel in emotional concealing?

No matter what I do 
I never measure up for you
But you just keep that smile on your face
No matter how much I try
You're never really satisfied
Until you run away and hide

In your perfect world
Where there's no one to blame
No one can hurt your feelings
And you don't feel no pain
Everybody loves you
And nobody gets burned
As long as you are living
In your perfect world

It seems like everyone gets screened
On your answering machine
Can't take the call
And let down your defenses
You can't let anybody see
Your real personality
Is it pride, or just your false pretenses?

Maybe a part of you has died
Because you keep it all inside
But still you wear that smile on your face
It seems no matter what I do
I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you

In your perfect world
Where nothing can go wrong
You're always in control
And we all get along
And everything is beautiful
No need for concern
As long as you are living
In your perfect world

Maybe a part of you has died
Because you keep it all inside
Is it hard to keep that smile on you face

I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you

For a woman who will treat her right

And everybody needs somebody
She could be with anybody
Doesn't matter if it's not another man

Because love don't care who you love
I said love don't care who you love
If you ain't hurting anybody
And if you feel it deep inside
Then love don't care who you love
Don't care who you love

Little girl, she's no sister, she is white
But she loves a brother
Takin' him home to meet her folks tonight
Mom and dad don't understand
We're all the same inside
They just don't realize
That love is always colorblind

And everybody needs somebody
You can be with anybody
It's not the color that makes the man

Because love don't care who you love
I said love don't care who you love
Don't let anybody tell you

Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road

There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey

I've found my heaven, right here with you
Believe in me, forever I believe in you

Remember everything that you've learned

When you roll the dice you'd better think twice
'Cause what you see ain't always what you get

You take the risk right from the start
'Cause love is a dangerous thing
It's like a loaded gun pointed straight at your heart
Love is a dangerous thing

She justifies adultery as a meaningless affair

Just like everybody I got a black book too

I can't hide from my emotions
Stop old dreams and crush my fears and turn away forever
I'll get by without you now so leave me alone
You won't be there tomorrow

I tried everything I could to hold onto that life
But now I see I realized I wasn't always right
I'll take the good and leave the bad and walk out of the door

But we were old enough to have some fun
And we`d laugh until it hurt and we were both in tears

We couldn`t go inside for a couple years more
So we`d send the older kids to sneak a couple of beers

And when I see you shake it makes me want to shout
Take it off
So take 'em down and hit the lights
Show me that you've got nothing to hide
I don't mean any disrespect you've got sex appeal
I just can't control the way you make me feel
It's time to strip your inhibitions and indulge my fantasies
To see you wearing nothing but a smile makes me scream
Take it off
Get naked from your head down to your toes
You look much better when you're not wearing any clothes
I want you to let it all hang out
And when I see you shake it makes me want to shout

They're only whistling in the dark 
 
So many ways the game could go 
Timer ticks out minutes left 
Until it's going to blow 
She may stumble, but she won't fall 
Waiting for the curtain call 
As history repeats in motion slow 
 
And though her repertoire is good 
It's just a faded valentine 
Between the hammer and the nails 
There lies unspoken compromise 
Then it strikes you 
Right between the eyes 
 
Cause when tomorrow's blown away 
Seems like tonight is here to stay 
So she just close her eyes and stumble forward

That she is whistling in the dark?",Whistling in the Dark

How long can men behave this way
The longest day has taken our loves
How long can wars remain

A day like others, until the bombs fell our way
My son and wife died and left our small hometown in flames

Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees that at all
They all say she's crazy

Lockin' rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing woman into life
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between
Will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-filled line of sanity
It's a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery
You touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push of the world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays alive

There's a cold, cold native heat
Struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her hair
Against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

You turned and said to me

And sedately I sat there
In my quiet mist of rage
How I wanted to tell you
But I was hushed by my shame

So when the waves come rolling in
Then I won't turn the tide
And in the line of fire
You'll set me aside
So go on Richard let go

And I can still remember
The laughter in a stranger's face
And the way you would tell me
To slow down my pace

See no living is that easy
No living is that fair
Of course I was going to lose you
Were you ever even there?

So when the waves come rolling in

I was laughing at something
At the airport terminal
At nine in the evening
I was sitting crying to you over the phone
Well passing the border from a state to another
Filled with people whom I couldn't help to relate to
And we stopped a while at a roadside restaurant
Where the waitress was sitting outside smoking in her car
She had that look of total fear in her eyes
And as we drove away from there she looked at me and
She smiled

Trying to find the ground

And my feet are in the sky
Well I'm nobody's baby
I'm everybody's girl
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world

And once you asked me well what's my biggest fear
That things would always remain so unclear
That one day I'd wake up all alone
With a big family and emptiness deep in my bones
That I would be so blinded, turn a deaf ear
And that my fake laugh would suddenly sound sincere

Now I wasn't born for anything
Wasn't born to say anything
Oh I'm just here now and soon I'll be gone

While I sleep they start dimming the lights

Long before I knew
What it meant to give everything up

I was a rolling stone
Rolling my way alone

But you couldn't wait
I couldn't promise you anything
If it was all a mistake
Then I guess we're both to blame

I could have been
So many things
But it would never be enough for you

I was the one
You counted on
But I was never the one for you
Now I know, I lost you a long time ago

Out of danger
In your arms, I was half awake, half asleep

Grab ahold to what I got
Regretting all that I'm not
I couldn't be the one who'd stand by your side

For something to bring me around and smile
'Cause that only sticks for a while
Then I'm back again

Oh, I'm a master pretender

I always knew that I was young
But with a head held high and a shotgun
I could fool almost anyone

I never expected to be struck
By the fatal hands of fortune or by sheer bad luck

By now we won't change
And memories just rearrange
And fall into place

First Call,"Oh, it chills me to the bone
To see this place that we call home
Once peaceful, perfect now invaded
A war zone being raided

The air is cold and the streets are hard
Life is spilled on the boulevard
And our hopelessness is growing stronger
How can we wait any longer?

Someday, you know
We're gonna leave it all behind us
Someday, oh, heaven's gonna find us
Someday, we'll be together
Oh, someday, someday

Beauty shouts on every hill
That our Lord is Lord
Even still the battle for this land remains
As Satan tires to stake His claim

This wounded earth may weep today
But our tears will soon be wiped away
And our faithfulness is growing stronger
Oh, I can't wait any longer

Someday, you know
We're gonna leave it all behind us
Someday, oh, heaven's gonna find us
Someday, we'll be together
Oh, someday, someday

For beyond clouds of darkness
I can see a host of angels to welcome me
I see You standing at the end of the road
Just waiting there, waiting there
To carry me home

I've been waiting for this moment now
I've been holding on, I've been holding out
Waiting for this day to come someday

I look to the left, I look to the right
Looking for the city lights someday

Because there is someone I can't tell
Who means the world to me

It hasn't been a whole night and a day

Putting obstacles around your sunken walls
In a home without a road
A song without a note of hope
I dare you to forget the things you know

There's little pieces of the road in everything you do
And though you think I'm out to hurt you
I never wanted to
Maybe if I wasn't older we'd still be rolling by
Maybe we would still be rolling

To relieve me of the things I have to do
If you want to, sing along
To save it all and make it so
You'll always have a way to make it me

Pretty paracetamol you soothe my aching brow,

They often fool the naked eye.

It's hard to read the writing on the label,
I force my eyes out sideways but I can't resist the strain,
And it don't help me, no it don't help me,

They often fool the naked eye.
I think I recognize a friendly face I've seen before,
I'm floating far too quickly to be sure,

Take this inner web of twisted memories and lies,
(There's no one there)
I'm fighting for a reason to go on.

From laughing or crying it don't mean that much to me

When you're staring at the writing on the wall
Condemned by the critics who want to tear me down
When it's just another lyric going for a song
We're low on life on the highway in search of coin
Picking up the pennies from the road
Guided by direction in the wake of stars
We were driven by a dream that's broken down
But the bandwagon's parked up in another town
We hope tomorrow its heading out our way
To get us out the tunnel where we've paid our dues
With friends we buried there beyond the lights
Raw meat for the balcony
Is that all I am, is that all I'm going to be?
Raw meat for the balcony,
Nobody's fool but mine, is that my destiny?
But if that bandwagon takes off for another town
And the suits that buy the wine don't like my song
Though I'm playing to empty tables
Till the curtain falls
I'll always find the strength to carry on
I'll always have the strength to carry on

At the time just a little white lie.
It was one of the first, but it hurt me the most,

That even the good guys must die.
There's no reasoning, no crimes, and I never knew why;
Even now it still makes me cry.

You stand so close, but you never understand it.
For all that we see is not what it seems; am I blind?
And you sit there and talk revolution,
But can you tell me just who's in command?
When you tell me the forces we are fighting
Then I'll gladly join and make plans.
But for now, only, our t-shirts cry freedom,
And our voices are gagged by our greed.
Our minds are harnessed by knowledge
By the hill and the will to succeed.
And if that's not what you believe,
Would you let me know I'm not standing alone;
That I'm not just a voice in the crowd.
If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little helping hand, just a little understanding.
Just a little understanding to the questions that I'm asking you.

Where nothing, here, is ever what it seems.
I'm scared to shout in case I draw attention from the powers
That preside over our minds and our lives.
When they find what I want is the deadliest weapon; that is truth;
Day by day it's getting louder,
And day by day it's getting stronger.
But when I can't scream no more, and I need reassurance,
I listen to the crowd.

No one ventures into the streets these days,
Except strangers and those like me, looking for work.
I noticed the smell when I got off the bus,
And traced it down to a canal that ran
Right through the heart of the city,
Like an open vein full of black rotten blood.
A mirror surface, broken only by the bubbles of gas
Escaping from the stagnating mess that lay on the bottom.
Fuelled by the chemicals and effluent of the city,
Which was fed, in turn, by the barges and the ships
That followed that line and created the waves across that
Surface to the dockside, where they unloaded their holds.
The swarms of people clambering over them.
I sat down in a cafe and I was holding my own,
And minding my own business,
And a voice spoke in my ears as if it recognized
That I was questioning the source of the smell.

Have another beer boy, take it with a pinch of snuff.
And my eyes were bedazzled, by the jewels in his silken cuff.
And a voice rolled out from an ashen cloud from behind a long cigar;
Son, you'll never need to smell the black canal.

It was as if he'd read my mind, as if he expected it,
And, as the afternoon was wasted, I became aware
I was becoming wrapped up in his world.
I became aware of the smell from the bouquet in his buttonhole.

It was taking me away from the canal,
And away from my questions.
I was aware that the perfumes were all around us;
And he sold me the city, well at least he tried to with all his stories.

All the silks out of China,
And all the satins out of Spain.
All the powders for your noses
Will keep the stench at bay.

You followed the rules, you gave it your lot,
But a younger man's just taken on your job.
We've all got long term contracts with the man upstairs,
But who's picking up the options on our souls?
When it's one life firm and the deal is up,
You bow down, bow down to the Emperor's song.
What do you do when its all too much?
When you're out of luck and out of touch,
And you can't relate to anything they say?
What you do when it gets too tough,
When you want to say that enough's enough?
You want to walk away and just throw in the towel.
Do you go with the grain, do you go with the tide?
Do you go with the crowd, do you go for the ride?
Do you hang on in until the bitter end?
There's a bandwagon leaving but it's not for me.
I've swallowed all the hooks and want no more.
But when the lights are dimmed and the curtain calls,
You bow down, bow down, to the Emperor's song.",Emperor's Song
Fish,"I was walking in the park dreaming of a spark
When I heard the sprinklers whisper
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns
Then I heard the children singing
They were running through the rainbows
They were singing a song for you
Well it seemed to be a song for you
The one I wanted to write for you, for you
Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green
When I am King, dilly dilly, you will be Queen
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love, IOU for your love
Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you

For your love",Lavender
Fish,"Waiting in my corner, waiting on the bell.
I was coming off the ropes, I was going to give them hell.
Now I'm waiting,
Waiting on the lyric, waiting on the song.
I know the muse is coming, I'm holding on.
I'm waiting,
Waiting on the chances, waiting on the breaks,
Waiting on an opportunity that I could take.
I'm still waiting.

And all the time I wonder why,
Just what or who the hell I am?
Where I'm at, where I'm from?
Where I'm going, where I belong?
Tell me where I'm coming from,
Because I'm waiting in the pipeline.
Waiting on a message, waiting on a sign.
I was waiting on my holy grail to shine.
Waiting with the crossword, waiting on reviews,
Waiting on something or someone to give me a clue.
I'm still waiting.

And all the time I wonder why,
Just what or who the hell I am?
Where I'm at, where I'm from?
Where I'm going, where I belong?
Why do you keep me waiting on?
Because I'm waiting in the pipeline.
If the carpet that I'm sitting on could fly,
If the ring that's on my finger was a sorcerer's charm,
If the cloak that I'm wearing could hide me away,
I could wait for forever and a day.
If the lady that I'm waiting on isn't mine,
Then the castles that I'm building are on shifting sands.
If the dream that I'm chasing isn't true,
Then the light at the end of the tunnel is just a wrecker's fire.
Waiting in the pipeline, waiting on the silence,
Waiting on the sound, waiting in the backstage,
Waiting on the crowd, waiting,
Waiting on the critic, waiting on the gong,
Waiting on the DJ to play my song.
Play my song, I'm waiting.
And all the time I wonder why,
Just what or who the hell I am?
Where I'm at, where I'm from?
Where I'm going, where I belong?
Tell me where I'm coming from,

My fingernails are bleeding from climbing up the wall
This time you really hurt me right down to the core
And I'm desperately trying to find a reason to forgive you for it all

In a trance I was held by the shadowplay
In the spell of the shadowplay
From Celtic illumination
I see the Celtic illumination
The Celtic

I never realized just how far we'd gone
I turned around and all that I saw was distance
Through an anger that burned every time
That someone mentioned your name
I should have noticed, should have read the signs
We could have talked it out if there was a problem
It wasn't obvious then
But then it isn't really obvious now

I could have been whatever you wanted me to be
If you gave me the chance

I'd thought it out, thought I had the answers
After all is said and done
The only thing I really know is your name

Let me in into the world of the shadowplay
I'll follow you to the shadowplay
Through Celtic illumination
Give me the Celtic illumination

Fish,"Listen to me,
Just hear me out.
If I could have your attention?
Just quietin' down for a voice in the crowd.
I get so confused and I don't understand.
I know you feel the same way you've always wanted to say,
But you don't get the chance.
Just a voice in the crowd.

I don't know the score anymore;
It's not clear anymore.
I can't tell right from wrong anymore;
I just don't understand.
I was sitting here thinking of exchanging a new world for old;
Like changing the channels on TV,
Or the dirt that we stand in, to gold.

When I was young
My father told me just bad guys die,
At the time just a little white lie.
It was one of the first but it hurt me the most,
And the truth stung like tears in my eyes;
That even the good guys must die.
There's no reasoning, no crimes, and I never knew why.
Even now, it still makes me cry.

If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little helping hand, just a little understanding.
Just some answers to the questions that surround me now.
If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right.
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you.
I keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors,
Where nothing here is ever what it seems.
You stand so close but you never understand it.
For all that we see is not all that it seems; am I blind?

And you sit there and talk revolution,
But can you tell me just who's in command?
When you tell me the forces we're fighting,
Then I`ll join you and gladly make plans,
But for now only our t-shirts cry freedom,
And our voices are gagged by our greed.
Our minds are harnessed by knowledge,
By the hill and the will to succeed,
And if that's not what you believe,
Would you just let me know
I'm not standing alone,
That I'm not just a voice in the crowd?

If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little helping hand, just a little understanding.
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you.
If there's somebody up there, just throw me down a line?
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right.
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you.
I'll keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors,
Where nothing is exactly how it seems.
You're reaching out, you're so close you can touch it,
But it all disappears when it's always so near.
But one day, we will find that we stand in the light.
Until then, I'll keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors.
Nothing here is ever what it seems.
I'm scared to shout, in case I draw attention from the powers
That preside over our minds and our lives,
When they find what I want is the deadliest weapon; that is truth.

Day by day it`s getting louder,
And day by day it`s getting stronger.
But when I can`t scream no more and I need reassurance,
I listen to the crowd.

And the hill - it stared back.",Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors

Hi, Doc
Hey Fish, what are you doin'?
If you don't mind we're gonna record this
Is that cool?

Oh, that's cooler'n hell
Hell yeah, 52's biggest dream man
You know his biggest dream was
Me and him go party with you

On the trail of torn out twisters
Two angels on a mission came
Dust devils danced before them
In the path of the hurricane

On the road to Oklahoma
Through the flatlands from L.A.
From the shadows in the valley
From a country where the lizards play

While they drove they kept the radio on
Why don't you sing along, sing along, sing along?

A man stands behind his words
These men are together with family
To defend their rights in another man's world

Okay, here's what happened

52 barred the door shut from the inside
A gunfight started on the front porch
52 shot back

You know they come into his home with it
So he's protecting himself
The guy inside the house blew his brains out

Yeah, they made it look like he killed himself
But no one believes he would
'Cause he's not that kind of man, that's all

I think, he wasn't afraid of death
You know, he believed in something to die for
That's what he did

Some say he had it coming
Others say he was sole to blame
But who says they've got the rights
If any at all to blow the brothers away

A man got a right to dream

Was they've come in and murdered him
For his bombs and his ammunition

Just like that Waco Texas
Or any of these other things
Over here in the United States

Anybody that's stockpiling firearms and ammunitions
Is a threat to the government
So the government wages war against us

They tortured him, he went out
But I'm sure he stood up
Like he was supposed to, you know?

They smashed all the rings
Shut on his fingers with a hammer
It was all an orchestrated plan, man

The more the closer I was getting to it to the truth
The more they got everybody looking at me
As being the guy that pulled the trigger

Fish,"The car finally burned out around three. The blue beacon
Of a silent patrol car threw new shadows into the street
Turning the window into a flickering monitor screen
I'd seen the kids torch the vehicle before I left, on a
Nightly surfing run to a cybersex site in Chile
It wasn't as if they were getting rid of prints, everyone
Knew it was them. They didn't give a shit. They just
Wanted to see the flames, to throw a bit of light on a
Situation. I looked up the hill at the spread of the estate
The streetlights glowed like campfires of an army on the
Eve of battle, or fireflies trapped in the canopy
Of an immense jungle
Jungle, young mental jungle
Here in the jungle, in the jungle
Where men don't cry, and husbands lie, and you never have
To justify a kickin'
When mates jump in to save your skin, if a chib is ever
Pulled out in a square go

Jungle ride, jungle ride, tell me when it's over
Jungle ride, jungle ride, tell me when it ends

Oh, here she comes 'round again, here she comes round again
Here she comes round again, here she comes, here she comes
The glazed eyes of porcelain clowns stare skywards, at clouds
Of goldfish, madly circling their own silent plastic worlds, high
Above the children who stuff ping pong balls like pills
In the mouths of slowly rotating heads
Intentions true as the arrow's flight wins a cuddly toy
To while away an evening. Outside this ring of light
He'll claim his prize, she'll sport lovebites just to
Prove to all he's been there

Jungle ride, jungle ride, tell me when it's over
Jungle ride, jungle ride, tell me when it ends

Oh, here she comes round again, here she comes round again
Here she comes round again, here she comes, here she comes
I crept along the edges of the parade, staying glued to the
Shadows where the dogs slept uneasily on their chains
Under the caravans
I followed the drums and the pulsing light, until I came across
A clearing in the centre, of which was the attraction
And then I saw her, an angel in a chariot, her hair
Trailing behind her like the tail of a comet and I knew
That she was mine. I knew that we were destined
To leave this place together. We didn't belong to this
Carnage, and the knowledge of escape was the only thing
Keeping me sane. But for now I could only watch and
Wait, for this was an arena I dare not enter
On the rim of the machine the animals had gathered
Big cats at a waterhole, waiting on the weak and wounded
To stagger into their territory, so they could exercise
Some violence and feed their starving reputations
No climb-down in this standoff with the world
They already know that they can never win the war
But in this battle they're gonna do some damage
The pack will follow the stragglers into the dawn

You hope that they burn the whole house around your ears
And they don't discover you hiding in the cellar

Because you've got nowhere to go

That something is gonna happen

And the limelight splutters to darkness in the death of a Zippo.
At the backstage door the last fan has long disappeared
With a plastic bag stuffed full of memories.
If only you'd signed them, if only to testify, if only to recognize that he existed.
That for a moment he stood there.
Side by side in the gutter on the hard cold shoulder of destiny.

You say never again this is the end and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Year after year you pretend it's for real and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Well happy birthday to me!

When you're the worm in the bottle.
You're the last one to leave and there's nowhere to go to.
And the minicab driver politely suggests you go home.
If you could only remember, just where that's at,
Just where you been, just where it went wrong.
You'll eventually find it.

You say never again this is the end and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Year after year you pretend it's for real and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Well happy birthday to me!

When you're down to the end line and they're writing you up and writing you off and it feels just like an obituary.
You feel it's all over. You want to drive on down to the beach
And just keep on swimming. But you're still treading water.

You say never again this is the end and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Year after year you pretend it's for real and it's all gonna change you're determined this time.
Well happy birthday to me!

 This is my address",The Pilgrim's Address
Fish,"She holds court, queen of all the mountains
Snow leopards hide amongst her hills,
The bong billows clouds up to the ceiling
Fresh stars day-glo in the night.

Mai-Tais at the bar, she only sees charlie at weekends,
The cocktail monkeys are climbing, a tower is chiming, faraway.
Micha is smiling back in Tiki 4
Back in Tiki 4.

One eye is all that is needed to be king of all he surveys,
Grandmaster, apprentice of architects
Design curves where others leave trails
It's freaking you out as you search for the lock on the door

Pillars of smoke are guiding you back to the floor
Back to Tiki 4
Tiki 4
Tiki 4

And the darkness zips up the city like a body bag
The good citizens are lying asleep in their beds dreaming of the day ahead
Meanwhile we're back in Tiki 4.
Tiki 4

Back in Tiki 4

Renee is curled up on the sofa
Judy scratches away at her scars
Loud lines that were only a whisper
Too weak for the angels to hear

But she's proud, she got the respect of her mother
She didn't waver, straight down the lines and out of sight
Judy woke up in Tiki 4
Back in Tiki 4

And the darkness zips up the city just like a body bag
The good citizens are lying asleep in their beds dreaming of the day ahead
Meanwhile we're back in Tiki 4.
Tiki 4

Back in Tiki 4
