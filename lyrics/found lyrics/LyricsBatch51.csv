Deborahe Glasgow,"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love har taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
The turn around and leave again

This love har taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love har taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love har taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore",This Love
Debra Ashley,"If you call out loud
Will it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
So give yourself
A chance

'cause you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And, little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You gotta know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground

Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself no matter what it's gon' take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith

gon' keep it brother
You got it
And when you think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of when you're all alone
And you can go by feel
'stead of circumstance
But the power's in beliving
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you only try

So keep the faith, ow
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

I told my brother how to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride
Go for what you want, don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner,
But you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it brother
You got it
I know that keepin' the faith
Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has
To make it right
Makes it
Makes it right

Keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground
Keep the faith
Baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Better stand up and act like you wanna do right
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday
Go for what you want and don't forget the faith
Look at yourself and what you're doin' right now
Stand back a minute just to check yourself out
Straighten out your life and how you're livin' each day
Get yourself together, 'cause you got to keep the faith
Uh, uh, uh

Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Lift up your mind
Before your mind gets blown
Some things in life you best just leave them alone
Go for what you want
Don't let it get in your way
You can make it happen
But ya got ta keep the faith

Gon' keep it brother
You got to keep the faith
Yeah keep the faith
Gon' keep it sister
You got to keep the faith now, now

I'll show my brotha
How to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner if you keep the faith

Straighten out yourself and get your mind on track
Dust off your butt and get your self-respect back
You've known me long enough to know that I don't play
Take it like you want it but you got to keep the faith
Gon'

Don't let nobody take you down
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And get your feet back on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

But till that day
I said you've got to keep the faith!",Keep the Faith
Debra B. Morton,"It's a long stretch of highway
From Tulsa to Tennessee
You know I had to do it my way
It may've got the best of me
Sometimes at midnight
I hear a voice
It echoes in my head
And says that I still have a choice

(Chorus)
I could get right
Get baptized
Tomorrow I could prob'ly have a pretty good life
But tonight I
Don't think I'll
Slow these horses down
There's a full moon
Hear the wolf howl
And one more drink'll put me on the ground
But tonight I've gone too far to turn around

Should have listened to my mama
Lord knows, that woman tried
Yeah, she saw this road a-comin'
And her fears were justified
I can't hide
I can't run
I can still see the smoke from the barrel of the gun
What's gone is gone
And what's done is done

(Repeat chorus)

Woooooah, is there a Heaven or a Hell?
Woooooah, only time will tell

There's a full moon
Hear the wolf howl
And one more drink'll put me on the ground
But tonight I've gone too far
Tonight I've gone too far
Tonight I've gone too far to turn around",Too Far to Turn Around
Debra Dean,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day

Debra Holly,"There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
The corn is as high as an elephants eye,
An' it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the cattle are standin' like statues,
All the cattle are standin' like statues,
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music

Debra Holly,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Debra Killings,"Sometimes, you won't
Just walk away
And leave it all

Then you hear a voice
Soft and low
Sis, don't you cry
'Cause I'll pull you through

You may not need no money
'Cause you've lived your life

Hold on, 'cause your help

Debra Mann,"A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

But all my friends whatever skies above

Debrae,"Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

You said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Debrah Kay,"There's a van out in the drive
It's time to divide everything up
We've taken down the bed
Where so many nights we made love
We've gone through everything
And given back the rings
We once cherished
You can take the things you want
And leave the things you don't
But as for me

I'll take the memories
You can have the rest
I know we had some bad times
But our good times were the best
There's so many keepsakes
After all we've been through
But I'll take the memories
If I can't have you

I don't know just what I'll do
I've been so used to loving you
Such a long time
Even though I'll try
There's no way that I'll get you off my mind
So while we're packing up our lives
And saying our goodbyes, I want to tell you
You can take the things you want
And leave the things you want
And leave the things you don't
But as for me

People getting ready for the news
Some are happy, some are sad

What the people need
Is a way to make 'em smile

Gotta get a message

Well I know, you know better

And we'll dance
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away
And if I'm feeling good to you
And you're feeling good to me
There ain't nothing we can't do or say
Feeling good, feeling fine

shattered glass bits of clothing and human deceit

Directionless rush, for close by, before
Species specific-motion
No change for equilibrium-stop!
Fetid, persistent stench of the race
Rushes in every slot
Sticking all together into a mass

I hate us!
You know what I mean? Fuck off!

Deceased,"It's midnight!!!
The sharpened clock, it tells the time, and yes,
It all stands still
The missing link, a thousand worlds,
What does this all reveal?
A given time, another plane, a place for all escape
As every night, without the light, I am possessed with hate
Unlock the haunted room and gaze into dreams
Alone with the dead, rebirth is near
A zombie stare comes over me, begin my rushing pulse
The dark invades my open mind, which leads me to convulse
My tortured soul, my every thought detached away from me
My quest to kill has been fulfilled, for death's my only need
Unlock the haunted room and gaze into dreams
Alone with the dead, rebirth of an ongoing fear
It's now the time to begin your fate, when darkness falls,
You will obey
The gift of evil has come to thee,
And as my servant chant with me.....
""It's midnight, a time of killing ghouls, an hour of bloodshed,
A world where evil rules""
Yes, midnight, the time for all death to rise, at midnight
I feel the urge to kill!!!
I call death's tune and create doom,
my heart is black, unpure
My soul flies free, as insanity has now been reborn
Through evil's door
I lunge at the corpse, I tear out the throat,
To drink the blood of death
To all mankind, I wish the Earth, a cemetery mess,
A nightmare of death, to never rest
The sharpened clock, it tells the time, and yes,
It all stands still
The missing link, a thousand worlds, what does this all reveal?
My tortured soul, my every thought detached away from me
And once again, as my slave, you must now repeat
""It's midnight, a time for killing ghouls, an hour of bloodshed
A world where evil rules""
As the clock strikes the hour, it's midnight forever",Midnight
Deceased,"Our mind manipulation was no strength for the deceased
The master plan defeasted by the laws of earth's beliefs
And in death's costume now I live a lonely, empty corpse
Existing matter left to wait infinity's demise
For all the greed my just reward
The reaper's prize the mask of death
It fits my face and grips my skull as exact as can be
A perfect mold symmetric cast forever locked to me
For all the greed my just reward
The reaper's prize the mask of death
A marching ghoul the sight of hell, hell!

This war was Armageddon the rising of the dead
As every breath of every life has vanished from the world
And here we stand the winning losers left to wander earth
The miles and miles of emptiness witnessed by no one
And as the story ends I'm still wishing for my dream
Of being dead, forgotten, no longer a machine!

There isn't pulse yet on I go somewhere in between
I cannot stop my time on earth or end my legacy
Thinking back to my past in truth I fell from grace
And for my sins I'm one of ""them"" and they are one of me
And as the story ends I'm still wishing for my dream
Of being dead, forgotten, no longer a machine!

For what mind created man and what did end his reign?
Just who created planet earth and who created me?
For I am only flesh and bone a seed of many seeds
A soulless victim on a chain a slave to what does lead
I'm hell's forever!
A marching ghoul the sight of hell
Hell!

March!, March!, March!, March! Forever walking the earth
March!, March!, March!, March! Wearing the mask of hell
March!, March!, March!, March! Forever walking the earth
March!, March!, March!, March!

""As forever becomes no closer and the world it does not change
I admit my failures a thousand times in hope of some relief
Inside my mind there are questions but around me only time
Time to think where I went wrong and all I've left behind
And yes I know I'm searching for peace, tranquility
For the truth it stands before me, death is my destiny!""",Destiny
Deceased,"A place full of futuristic insight with those who share a magical gift
Foreseeing into future fully aware of what has come
You see they predicted monsters from the ground to swallow man
Safely in their fortress they live as if there is life
There's no fear of the living dead
They know they'll live on in their ""new world""
There's telepathic scenes with crystal balls and tarot cards
A cult of fortune tellers with minds that see all mystery
They say that they've been waiting for my arrival to their world
It seems as though I'm gifted with the sight to see beyond
As they prepare their magic I prepare my mind
To break this hold that's hanging on to keep me from my kind
As we join hands and chant the chant the truth is now revealed
I feel their power I join their ranks a living breathing lord
And now I know there's a future hidden beyond this world
A new beginning a higher plain very few shall see
By invitation I've been accepted to build and start again
I've learned these monsters are really saints cleansing all the earth
The undead have their purpose to strengthen, rebuild the weak!
Within my mind I realize there's still life to see
As I vision it now I can understand the reasons for their acts
I can see our world I can see beyond
We're not afraid forever we are strong!
And now there are no worries for all our goals will be achieved
While the outside world awaits this sudden ""plague"" to fade and die
And as all time keeps moving bringing the end to a tired world
We just stand by ready for our crowning moment to come!
Now they're tearing at our walls and challenging our force
A mutiny of our monsters now at war with our lords
Destiny all destiny a monster for infinity
Destiny my destiny an eternity of death
How quickly we lose battle with creatures that don't die
From beyond the grave these new messiahs control what's left of life
Destiny! All destiny, a monster for infinity
Destiny! My destiny, an eternity of death

He soon became a travellin' man 
He's travelled from town to town
The path he took was good to him
Till he drank his liquor down

Then he woke up a body died
Realized what he had done
Remembered what is daddy said
'Bout the House of the Rising Sun

There is a house in New Orleans
It's called the Rising Sun

Declan,"I heard she sang a lullaby
I heard she sang it from her heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
And gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because her kiss belonged to me

How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't she catch my falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart

I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in may
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name
I wonder if she makes him smile
The way she used to smile at me
I hope he doesn't make her laugh
Because her laugh belongs to me

How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't she catch my falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wish our love apart
How could an angel break my heart, oo ooo oo

Declan,"When the last Eagle flies over the last crumbling mountain
And the last Lion roars at the last dusty fountain
In the shadow of the forest though she may be old and worn
They will stare unbelieving at the last Unicorn

When the first breath of Winter through the flowers is icing
And you look to the North and a pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn
In the distance hear the laughter of the last unicorn

I'm alive, I?m alive

When the last moon is cast over the last star of morning
And the future has passed without even a last desperate warning
Then look into the sky where through the clouds a path is torn
Look and see her how she sparkles, it's the last unicorn

Look out on a summer's day 
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul 

Shadows on the hills 
Sketch the trees and daffodils 
Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
In colors on the snowy linen land

And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen 
They did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now

Swirling clouds and violet haze 
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue 
Colours changing hue 
Morning fields of amber grain 
Weathered faces lined in pain 
Are soothed beneath the artists' loving hand 

Now I understand 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen 
They did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now 

For they could not love you 
But still your love was true 
And when no hope was left inside 
On that starry, starry night 
You took your life as lover?s often do 
But I could have told you Vincent 
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you 


Starry, starry night 
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on name less walls
With eyes that watch the world and can?t forget
Like the strangers that you've met 
All the ragged men in ragged clothes 
The silver thorn of bloody rose 
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 

Now I think I know 
What you tried to say to me 
How you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 

They would not listen 
They're not listening still

But the question got the better of his scientific mind,

Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine?
Someone like you and made them mine?

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then.
But just remember the alternatives for I remember when
I was lonely and unhappy, 
And my lips were cold as ice.
But you kissed me, and good heavens, 
Now I'm here in paradise, 
So if ever I'm not kissing you or looking in your eyes.
I won't be blind, and I won't cry.

Its crystalline lines untouched by doubt
So vivid, so deprived of hesitation

The demons in us all by fumes portrayed

The canvas hurting souls caught and weaved

Our eyes met on the double take
The room stood still and the music drowned
Like a B-movie show on the edge of town

He had those eyes you wanna follow to a back room dive
And some bullshit story had me mesmerized
He didn't hold the door but he let me in
I set my suitcase down in a house a sin

That boy was trouble, trouble enough for a girl like me
Trouble, but I was so caught up I could barely see
Trouble

Where the hobos lived in chevys
With monkeys on their backs
I thought he was a hippie with a cowboy's heart
But we were just a couple a junkies falling apart

That boy was trouble, trouble enough for a girl like me
Trouble, but I was so caught up I could barely see
Trouble

Ever think you couldn't sink lower than the basement
Floor
Come to find much worse
Was waiting underneath that old trap door
Never had the nerve to leave until I'd finally broken
Down
Packed what I had, and took the last bus out of town

He wrote me a letter from a prison cell
Said he'd heard I'd gotten married and was doing well
Said he'd found his religion in the depths of hell

So clear in my ear
Like it was today
Come down in time

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,

Dee Daniels,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

After it brought my lover near

Dee Daniels,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

I do not really know how
Like a shot in the dark went your hallowed ground
Had you taken too much
Keep him well out of touch 
And refused to let him go
I cannot see to your pain
I do not hear you complain
You are now but a dot in the pouring rain
You created this mess
Now he's bent to your stress
And it seems to suit you well

Two can be lonely
One last child
Blessed and unholy
In his eyes the storm's surely rising up

You cannot turn this around
Like a walk in the dark
You have weighed him down
I can't stand in your place

You never talk about it
You never scream about it

But there's one thing I know 
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me 
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me 

Raindrops keep falling on my head

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Tell me is love
Still a popular suggestion
Or merely an obsolete art?
Forgive me for asking
This simple question
I'm unfamiliar with this part

To murmur, ""I adore him!""
When it's shamefully obvious I do?
Does love embarrass him
Or does it bore him?

Have I missed the path?
Have I gone astray?

Is there really any danger
That love his now out moded?

With what have you replaced it?
What is your latest foibal?
Is Gin Rummy more exquisite?
Is skiing more enjoyable?
For heaven's sake what is it?

I can't believe
That love has lost its glamor
That passion is really passe
If gender is just a term in grammer
How can I ever find my way?
Since I'm a stranger here myself

How can he ignore my
Available condition?
Why these Victorian views?

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Jenny made her mind up when she was three
She herself was going to trim the Christmas tree
Christmas Eve she lit the candles, tossed the tapers
away
Little Jenny was an orphan on Christmas day

Poor Jenny, bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
She lost one dad and mother, a sister and a brother
But she would make up her mind

Jenny made her mind up when she was twelve
That into foreign languages she would delve
But at seventeen to Vassar, it was quite a blow
That in twenty-seven languages she couldn't say no
Poor Jenny, bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
To Jenny I'm beholden, her heart was big and golden
But she would make up her mind

Jenny made her mind up at twenty-two
To get herself a husband was the thing to do
She got herself all dolled up in her satins and furs
And she got herself a husband--but he wasn't hers

Poor Jenny, bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
Deserved a bed of roses, but history discloses
That she would make up her mind

Jenny made her mind up at fifty-one
She would write her memoirs before she was done
The very day her book was published, history relates
There were wives who shot their husbands in some
thirty-three states

Jenny made her mind up at seventy-five
She would live to be the oldest woman alive
But gin and rum and destiny play funny tricks
And poor Jenny kicked the bucket at seventy-six
Jenny points a moral with which you cannot quarrel
Makes a lot of common sense
Jenny and her saga prove that you're gaga
If you don't keep sitting on the fence

Jenny and her story point the way to glory
To all man and womankind

Don't make up your mind",The Saga of Jenny
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Too soon, too soon.

We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars big stars blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars big stars blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars [From Lost in the Stars]
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song [From Knickerbocker Holiday]
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.
Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [From One Touch of Venus]
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Et maintenant que vais-je faire?
De tout ce temps que sera ma vie
De tous ces gens qui m'indiffèrent
Maintenant que tu es partie

Toutes ces nuits, pourquoi, pour qui?
Et ce matin qui revient pour rien
Ce coeur qui bat, pour qui, pourquoi?
Qui bat trop fort, trop fort

Et maintenant que vais-je faire
Vers quel néant glissera ma vie?
Tu m'as laissé la terre entière
Mais la terre sans toi c'est petit

Vous, mes amis, soyez gentils
Vous savez bien que l'on n'y peut rien
Même Paris crève d'ennui
Toutes ses rues me tuent

Et maintenant que vais-je faire?
Je vais en rire pour ne plus pleurer
Je vais brûler des nuits entières
Au matin je te haïrai

Et puis un soir dans mon miroir
Je verrai bien la fin du chemin
Pas une fleur et pas de pleurs
Au moment de l'adieu

Je n'ai vraiment plus rien à faire
Je n'ai vraiment plus rien",Et Maintenant (What Now My Love)
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",Mon Homme (My Man)
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side",Ne Me Quitte Pas (If You Go Away)
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"My skin is black
My arms are long
My hair is woolly
My back is strong
Strong enough to take the pain
Inflicted again and again
What do they call me
My name is aunt sarah

My hair is long
Between two worlds
I do belong

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",No More [Bambo]
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A  Foggy Day
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues

You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me and love another,
You'll regret it all some day:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you

And no one else could come between.
But not you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you

So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.

Thats where my heartland will be
The deer on the hill in the first snows of winter
the gull in the sky flying free

I wandered away from the dark crowded city,
Leaving my old life behind,
And I came to a place where a ring of bright water,
Dazzled all cares from my mind.

So I live with the wonder of the sky and the sea
And I'll always remember who revealed them to me

But now you are gone with your whirlpools of laughter
Leading me down to the sea
But I'll always smile when a ring of bright water
Echoes your laughter to me.

Four sordid rooms in Chelsea

She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower
As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour.

The day she died the neighbors
Came to snicker:
""well, that's what comes
From to much pills and liquor.""

But when I saw her laid out like a queen
He was the happiest corpse.
I'd ever seen.

I think of Elsie to this very day.
I'd remember how'd she turn to me and say:
""What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play.
Life is a cabaret, old chump, 
Come to the cabaret.""

I made up my mind back in Chelsea, 
When I go, I'm going like Elsie.

Laughing just like no one cares.

Someone in my house, I declare
Playing cards, solitaire
Who was playing in my house?
Someone in my kitchen, munching out
Peanut butter, there's no doubt
Who was eating in my house?

Someone took a bath, Mr. Bubble
Middle name, must be trouble
Who was playing in my house?
On the porch, right outside,
Here I come, you better hide
Who was hiding inside?

Who was that, who was that?

Won't you keep your hand up, oh?
Don't never, don't never give up
Don't you give up, keep your hand up

No all star cast, no scripts, no budgets
In the soundtrack of my life
Just drugs and violence, sex and cryin'
In the soundtrack of my life

I'm like Halle in monsters ball, Jada in set it off
In the soundtrack of my life
No special effects just rep my set
In the soundtrack of my life
Lights, camera, action

Deems,"Hmm Huh Hoo hoo hey baby
I'm looking for you 
Drifting on a memory 
Ain't no place I'd rather be 
Than with you, loving you 
Day will make a way for night 
All we'll need is candlelight 
And a song soft and long, well 
Glad to be here alone 
With a lover unlike no other 
Safe to see a new horizon 
Slowly coming into view 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Lovely as a ray of sun 
That touches me when the morning comes 
Feels good to me, my love and me 
Smoother than a gentle breeze 
Flowing through my mind with ease 
Soft as can be well when you're loving me 
Love to be Riding the waves of your love 
Enchanted with your touch It seems to me 
We can sail together in and out of mystery 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Paradise I have within 
Can't feel insecure again 
You're the key and this I see 
Now and then I lose my way 
Using words to try and say 
What I feel yeah love is real 
Ooh I might as well 
Sign my name on a card 
Which could say it better 
Time will tell 
'Cause it seems that I've done 
Just about all that I can do do do 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you",For the Love of You
Deems,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Deems,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be",Go Tell It on the Mountain/Jingle Bells
Deems,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Deems,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry

Deep Blue Organ Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Well, I can't give it

Deep Blue Something,"Souls suffer the landscape 
In shrouds of dew, as ghosts. 
Their eternity is for searching 
But a certain dissension grows. 
I've seen them wander, 
Voices raised in prayer 
Consorting in whisper, 
They curse the ones not there. 

If you didn't want this and I didn't need it, 
Then how has this interest become an addiction? 
If you didn't want it, then why can't you do without? 

I know I'm not your first one, 
But I pray I'll be your last. 
I've never seen you cry before, 
But I know when I make you laugh. 
I know and you know, you've heard this all before 
These arms are for holding on. 
This heart won't stray from home. 

If you didn't want this and I didn't need it, 
Then how has this interest become an addiction? 
If you didn't want it, then why can't you do without?

Deep Blue Something,"If I woke up one morning with my memory gone
I'd pick out some clothes and I'd put 'em on
And I'd walk down the street, and find a cafe
And I'd order a Guinness, and I'd sit there all day

Then some kids would come in and start a fuss
About how great their weekend in New Orleans was
Then I'd look down and smile like their tale was my own
I'd be drowning in memory, and then I would know

How it used to be in summer, so many years ago
When we really didn't worry, or care to know
Where we would be, or how old we had grown
Then I'd open my eyes and I know I was

Home, where my friends are
Even when I'm not, I wish you were here

Then it would rain, like it sometimes does
And if we were bored, it wouldn't bother us
We'd just get in the car and drive through the night
And be lost in East Texas, but no one would mind

'Cause we'd find our way home like we always do
Funny how the time flies in our youth
But with darkness approaching, we will all grow close
In the place we'll call Heaven but for now, we'll just call it

Home, where my friends are
Even when I'm not, I wish you were here
I'll see you at home
",Home

""I think I would be better dead""

I thought I knew what she was feelin'


And I assisted in her suicide
Now that she's on the other side
I know what she was after

And I
I, I, I can wait
Inside
I, I, I can wait

A cold and wet November's day
We lowered her into a grave
I had never seen her look so brave
No worms consume her body

And I
I, I, I can wait
Inside
I, I, I can wait

All these things are in my hair and she says
She says that, ""I won't""

Deep Blue Something,"I've got the same Kandinsky prints that my brother got
With the same black frames, like he bought
In between them, on the wall is something my girlfriend calls Trashy
Brownie and the Boo man got that for me

On the wall facing us is black and white of all of us back in Brighton
I remember it like today, but the sun has made that fade
Still, I know you know where England is

And I know this ain't home
But now it sure feels like home
And I know this somewhere is really nowhere

I've got a black and white TV, but I don't really see
The need to burden it with cable
I got the sofa from the folks, and the table I just stole
With a neon Mickey's sign for no reason

And I know this ain't home

I would, I would take you there

Would you know everything

Just the here and now, that is how we learn to connect with respect
Connect with respect, we need to break it on down and connect with respect

This freedom you don't wanna let me own it, but like a donut fried in a vat
I keep popping back up, as tough as the day that you denied me like Jesus
Three times before dawn, the battle likes are drawn and verbal bombs are your demise
The lies you told yourself are caught in your breath,

Respect those who resurrect flowers from the melting snow
This is a rhyme about giving and living more than I'm taking
Escaping the hum-drum of the barrel of a gun that I never held
This is the voice of the book worm, this is the voice of the bookworm

Of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me

With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle
The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow
I'm king of a mule

Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said ""I beg
Your pardon king Yertle""
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
""Silence!"" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burpin'

Deep Forest,"Throwing sparks at my frozen angel
Gathering the words to coax the fire to start
Throwing sparks at my frozen angel
Words to melt the ice around your pretty heart 

Turn the ice to water, the water into flood
The flood becomes a river, a river of pure love
Love comes into delta, nourishing the sea
Sea goes out to ocean
Ocean endlessly 

Throwing sparks at my frozen angel
Gathering the words to coax the fire to start
Turn the ice to water, the water into flood
The flood becomes a river, a river of pure love
Love comes into delta, nourishing the sea
Sea goes out to ocean
Ocean endlessly 

The second before you walk into the room
I had no thoughts of love whatsoever
Love was not on my mind
Nothing but my life,
My life was all settled in,
It was just the way it needed to be
And I fell upon you
Like something out of the blue
It was out of the blue, I didn't know
I didn't see it coming
But it came upon me
And it held a hold on me
Took a hold on me
And I could not help but believe
I have faith in this thing
I have one chance in my life and I must take it
And I've got to give it to you and I will not let it go
I will not let it go
It's the only thing I can believe in.
Oh, I can believe in.",Yuki Song
Deep Purple,"There once was a woman
A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery

I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn

I want you I need you I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you I need you I gotta be near you
Ooh I got a strange kind of woman

She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better she said
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star

She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died

I want you I need you I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you I need you I gotta be near you
Ooh I had a strange kind of woman",Strange Kind of Woman [Single Edit]
Deep Purple,"Yea, read all about it tell me
Have you heard the news
Captain Bob, he don't pay no dues, ah
You know he's lookin' in my window
He's steppin' on my toes
Don't want the truth and it goes to show

I got a joker up my sleeve
I know what to believe
It ain't right just because
It's in black and white

Find yourself a hero
Treat him like a friend
You build him up and tear him down again
Tear him down again
It don't hold a candle, hold it to the light
Check it out, is it wrong or right

Well, is this the news of the world
It's just a pretty girl
She's all the news that's fit to print
In black and white

Inside information, taken down note by note
A silent footstep, that's all she wrote
Shit, that's all she wrote
You got no need to worry
The baby's gone to bed
Dreaming dirty dreams in black and white and red
Aah aah

Well, now I got nothing to fear
Is this the scoop of the year
Headlines on my bathroom wall
In black and white, hey

I got a joker up my sleeve
It's so hard to believe
It ain't right just because
It's in black and white

Deep Purple,"Vibrant flashes in my mind
Remind me of a foregone time
The blackened faces, broken romance
Blackened faces

My broken heart has bled
With memories of a love that's dead
Sometimes happy then sad
I need love, love help me

Passing by the grounds of time
Memories that are only mine
Looking for love, a brand new love
Looking for love

Dreams that are hard to see
Finding a new love for me
Someday she must come along
I need love, love help me

I need love to come home
Somewhere there must be one

Hoping someday for good news
Waiting for that girl to choose
Only hoping, all I can do
Only hoping

One day she must come along
A girl as pretty as a song
A woman just meant for me
I need love, love help me

Vibrant flashes in my mind

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

On the foaming beach of the ocean,
In the day of trouble, 
I shall be of more service to thee

Past castles white and fair
Past dreaming chessmen on their boards
With a fool's mate as a snare

I know this from meditation""

From pages two to six
Past minstrels in their boxes
To the waters of the Styx

How can I hear when you speak so silently?

Words in my head can I get the message through?
Sword in my hand can cut through the wood
Peace in my heart can soften the mood

What shall I do when they stand smiling at me?
Look at the floor and be oh, so cool
Oh, so cool?

How shall I know when to start singing my song?
What shall I do if they all go wrong?
What shall I do?

What shall I do when they stand laughing at me?
Walk through the door and be oh so cool?

How shall I know when to stop singing my song?

Deep Purple,"April is a cruel time
Even though the sun may shine
And world looks in the shade as it slowly comes away
Still falls the April rain
And the valley's filled with pain
And you can't tell me quite why
As I look up to the gray sky
Where it should be blue
Grey sky where I should see you
Ask why, why it should be so
I'll cry, say that I don't know

Baby once in a while I'll forget and I'll smile
But then the feeling comes again of an April without end
Of an April lonely as a girl
In the dark of my mind I can see all too fine
But there is nothing to be done when I just can't feel the sun
And the springtime's the season of the night

Grey sky where I should see you
Ask why, why it should be so
I'll cry, say that I don't know
I don't know",April

In the summer days we flew to the sun
On melting wings
But the seasons changed to fast
Leave us all behind

fills the night with their loving

Deep Purple,"Really hate the running really hate the game
Looking at them all I want to be unborn again
Their suit is getting tighter although they're getting thin
The flies are crawling on their face and trying to get in

People say that we're to blame I say
No no no it's just the game
Must we let them fool us no no no
Have we got our freedom no no no
Is it getting better no no no
Do we love each other no no no
Must we wait forever no no no no no

Heads are getting stronger bodies getting weak
Looking at them all it feels good to be a freak
Their hands are getting closer they're reaching out so far
The greenies gonna get them make them serve stars
Tell them how it is and they say
No no no we know it all
The washing's getting dirty the air is getting thin
It's all in such a mess that no one knows where to begin
They talk about creating but all they do is kill
They say we're gonna mend it but they never will
Poison in the rain but they say
No no no we ain't to blame",No No No
Deep Purple,"Maybe it's because I'm only starting
That I think it won't take too long
Maybe it's because I can see you laughing
That I think you've got it wrong

Maybe I could be like Robin Hood
Like and outlaw dressed all in green
Someone said, ""What's he gonna turn out like""
Someone else said, ""Never mind""

Well, I was big and bold and more than twice as old
As all the cats, I'd ever seen
I grew my hair and bought a suit
Of shiny white or was it cream
I shook and shivered danced and quivered
And stood on a mountain top

No one came from miles around and said
""Man, your music is really hot""

Well, I knew what they meant because I was a freak
Ah, my throat was tired and worn
My pretty face just looked out of place
As they poured on the scorn

I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king
He said, ""My boy, we'll have some crazy scenes""
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about
He must've been the king of queens

Well, I could write a million songs about the things I've done
But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung
There's a law for the rich and one for the poor
And there's another one for singers
It's die young and live much longer
Spend your money and sit and wonder

No one came for miles around
And said man your music is really funky

Well, I believe that I must tell the truth
And say things as they really are
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth
Could I ever be a star

Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'
Everyone's shouting out loud
It's only the glitter and shine that gets through
Where's my Robin Hood outfit

Well, I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye
No one even cared enough to say goodbye
The money's good and the time you have
Fun and games galore
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten
And wonder what you did it for

No one came from miles around
And said, ""Man, who's he?""",No One Came [Remix '96]

Selling filth from a corner shop
And knitting patterns to the high street queue
She paints roses, even makes them smell good
And then she draws titties on the khazy wall
Drowns kittens just to get a thrill
And writes sermons in the Sunday Chronicle

How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?

Mary told Johnny not to write such trash
Said it was a waste of public money
She made a fuss, they made apologies

We really didn't know you'd had it in you
How you did it we can only surmise

When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?

Is more honest than your clean-up mind

Dig your self a hole and jump in it

Deep Purple,"Roll me over slowly, I've been drinkin' all night
Help me make a move, I can't stand the light 
Wake me, shake me, don't slam the door 
I ain't been so bad, I just can't recall 
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame
Lyin' on the floor I can't remember her name 
I can't stay here
There's something wrong here 
What's goin' on here?

Went downtown, had a long way to go 
How I got there, well, I don't know 
Found myself sittin' in a west side bar
Tried to leave but I could not go far 
High class woman try'n to give me a line
Should have left early when I felt so fine 
I can't stay here
There's something wrong here 
What's goin' on here?

When they closed up the bar, you know, they left me for dead 
I can't remember a thing I said 
Must have called the police to take me away 
They said, ""Forty days"", now I've got to pay 
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame
Lyin' on the floor I can't remember my name 
I can't get together while they're messin' with me
Keep on lookin' round, tell me where can I be 
I can't stay here

In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you

Love is the word and it can be heard
If you are young the message can be sung

Let me hear you sing, 
Hallelujah

Oh, tell it to the man who's power is the sermon on the wall
Tell it to the man who says you can misjudge them all
Tell it 'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowd
Tell it on the field of war and hope you'll soon be justified

There is a better way of life and it's not so hard to find
If you live and let the people in your world speak it's mind

I am the pupil who sells his life for freedom
All over the world and it can be heard
If you are young the message can be sung

Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.

Had a friend once in a room,
had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
we found a reason for the things we had to do.

Everybody was crying 
- Thank you. 
Yeah, everything up here, please. And a bit more monitor if you got it. Ah?
-(...everything louder than everything else.)
- Yeah, can we have everything louder than everything else? Right. 
No one sees the things you do
Because I stand in front of you
But you drive me all the time
You put evil in my mind
I used to sing and say my prayers
Live my life without a care
Now I have become a fool
'Cause I listen to the mule
How can I change when my mind
Is a friend of a Lucifer hid in the ground
Just another slave for the mule

A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery 
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said, I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman, yes I have

But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
Saturday nights from now on, baby, you're my star 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you

Dancing girls, silly girls, all kinds of girls
And it was loud
Tuning up to madness in the back room
Candles burning
Present the Stinking Hippy and throw the
Naked thunder to the crowd
In the Hungry Daze

The long and lonely highway drags along
It's going nowhere
Sickness and disease and mad
Corruption
Something's going wrong
The mountain's getting cold and lonely
The trees are bare
We all came out to Montreux
But that's another song
You've heard it all before
In hungry daze

Along the Mountain Road to do some
Drinking
And now we're mobile again
Different girls, laughing girls, forever

And it's so loud
The crew have lost again
They are beaten men
The winning team united
Living for the crowd
These are the hungry daze",Hungry Daze

How much can I afford

I got no reason to be down at the station
I got no ticket, but I'm gonna take a fucking ride
Don't care where I go
I never seem to know
I never had a penny, but I never wondered why
Oh no, I never wondered why

If I'm hungry then I eat

I'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light
So let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed 

I take my woman to the palace dancing
I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine
So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe

Under command
We're ordered to die or take this land

So safe in their castle keeps
They turn away as a mother weeps

Under crimson skies
There's a sadness reflected in a soldier's eyes

When the angels come to stay
And all the silent whispers
Will be blown away

A pair of high heel shoes
Hanging on the wall

One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show

Someone is waiting behind
An unlocked door
Grey circles overhead empties
On the floor
The cracks in the walls have
Grown too long

I know, I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Oh, is aching with the dead of the night
Oh oh precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain

But you know you're standing still
I'm afraid of your shadow

Deep Purple,"She walked into the room
Her hand upon her hip
Said 'look out boy
I'll make your backbone slip'
She looked straight at me
The devil in her eye
I knew what I was getting but took it by surprise
No fooling, she really knocked the stuffing out of me
Some woman
A hard lovin' woman
She chewed me up and spat me out

Some woman
She's a hard lovin' woman

She didn't wear nothing
But a smile upon her face
Licking her lips but I had the taste
Her temperature was rising
I was coming to the boil
Her fires were burning
She was pouring on the oil
I do not jest, she really took me to the cleaners
Some woman
A hard lovin' woman
It felt just great when she pulled her 38s

Some woman
She's a hard lovin' woman

A hard lovin' woman

It started with a smile
It turned into a laugh
It ended with a scream
I said 'enough's enough'
Never heard a word
She wouldn't let go
A man's a man and every woman ought to know
And there I was
And she was dancing

Washing the sin from the street
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing ground
Just trying to make ends meet
Well I work every day to sweat out my dreams
Won't you show me that you understand
It's only my life, whatever that means
And you've got it all in your hands

I need someone to pull me through
Won't you take the pain from my head
Give me all your loving, the way you always do
Give me breakfast in bed

I feel like the good days are numbered
And my nights are getting too long
My hopes and my fears take their toll on the years
And my willpower's almost gone

A time of desperate need
Sometimes life don't make sense
Fighting the anger, jealousy and greed
One day I'll look back and wonder where it all went

I was on my way up and you were going down

Fire in the basement
Burn me up, scream and shout
There's fire in the basement
Only you can put it out

This strange sensation that I'm going through
Sweet infatuation when I get next to you

You know I'll hate to leave you girl but I'm so glad I came

I'll drag your lungs out through your nose
Space truckers free and high
Teamsters get you by and by
That should keep you on your toes

They got a gun at your head
But you ain't necessarily playing their game
They can't resist
A Gypsy's Kiss
All that's needed to drive them insane

John Wayne, the Alamo
Crazy Horse, Geronimo
I'll smoke a piece with you
Mind, body heart and soul
We got rock and roll
And there's nothing they can do

Hear the small voice of truth
Above the shouting despair of the crowd
What do you wish
A Gypsy's Kiss?
Gets you strong for crying out loud.",Gypsy's Kiss
Deep Purple,"Sweet Lucy was a dancer 
But none of us would chance her 
Because she was a Samurai 
She made electric shadows 
Beyond our fingertips 
And none of us could reach that high 
She came on like a teaser 
I had to touch and please her 
Enjoy a little paradise 
The log was in my pocket 
When Lucy met the Rocket
And she never knew the reason why 

I can't deny it 
With that smile on her face 
It's not the kill 
It's the thrill of the chase 

Feel it coming 
It's knocking at the door 
You know it's no good running 
It's not against the law 
The point of no return 
And now you know the score 
And now you're learning 
What's knockin' at your back door 

Sweet Nancy was so fancy 
To get into her pantry 
Had to be the aristocracy 
The members that she toyed with 
At her city club 
Were something in diplomacy 
So we put her on the hit list 
Of a common cunning linguist 
A master of many tongues 
And now she eases gently 
From her Austin to her Bentley 
Suddenly she feels so young",Knocking at Your Back Door

Deep Purple,"Oh the beggar on his cornerstone
Catches pity in his wrinkled hand
But the lover whose bird has flown
Catches nothing only grains of sand

All the children in the distant house
They have feelings only children know

Catches nothing only flakes of snow

The sensation is not new to you
It's something we all have known
You get it - it goes right through you
Yes it's something we all have known

And the bird it has flown
To a place on it's own
Somewhere all alone

Now the hermit in his lonely cave
Has himself to keep him company
But the lover whose bird has flown
He has heartaches same as you and me

But I learned how to roll along

Cos when you're old it ain't too good on your own""
Been so long, since you heard my song
Gonna pick up my guitar 'n' play
Felt so bad when I had to leave you

So I'm comin' home
To give you more than you bargained for 
Comin' home
No mistake, I'm gonna shiver 'n' shake

The thrill is gone, but it won't be for long
Cos you know I like to play how I feel
Now that we're all back together
Gonna shiver 'n' shake all night
I just gotta say, the music I play
Will sure 'nough make you feel alright

Tho' I learned how to rock in the cradle
An' rollin' came so easy to me
All the years I travelled the world
Made it so clear to see
It's been so long since you heard my song
Gonna pick up my guitar 'n' play
Felt so bad when I had to leave you
But I knew that I'd be back some day

I can see what's wrong with me
It's in my head

I can see what's gonna be
As I lie in my bed

Man is not my brotherhood
I am of the dead

I died as I lived as I loved and was born
On some distant hill

The reasons to hide were the reasons I cried
Fools pass laughing still

There can be bad blood in all I can see
It's in my brain

You don't know the pain I feel
As I must live again

Rocks and stones can't bruise my soul but
Tears will leave a stain

They smile to themselves as they lay down my head
On some distant hill

The blind and the child sweep a tear from their eye
Fools smile as they kill

I got my own way to go and now I want
To take your minds

I believe if you could see
The blood between the lines

I believe that you could be
A better kind

On some greener hill

With the wind on the bend and my back in my hand

Of shiny white or was it cream

Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak

He said my boy we'll have some crazy scenes
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about

And there's another one for sing

Drowns kittens just to get a thrill

Playing my guitar
I don't have to be where I don't want to be at all
Maybe I'll go far
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream
Ah, in a dream

Sitting in a landscape full of sighs
Dream away the day
Making up a tune about the blueness of the skies
This is where I'll stay
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream
Oh, in a dream

Sails across my mind
In between the images that drift along my tune

Because she was a Samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high

Enjoy a little paradise

When Lucy met the Rockett
And she never knew the reason why

To get into her pantry
Had to be the aristocracy

At her city club
Were something in diplomacy

A master of many tongues

I may be crazy
But I'm no stupid
I get along
I use my silver tongue

You know I can dream in any language
Flying on my magic bed
And I don't need to work my passage
All I do is use my head

I may be crazy
But I'm no stupid
Sometimes I ramble
Then I'm Lucid
I might seem lazy
But I'm hurting no-one
I get along
I use my silver tongue

But you don't know what's in my mind
You went too fast and now your sinking
Because you forgot to read the signs",Silver Tongue
Deep Purple,"Oh you're all looking up
With hearts of devotion
Through the dust and the heat lost to me
In a cloud of emotion
I have no motivation
To keep this breathless pace
I'm more inclined to stay here
In this breathing space

And the sun goes down
And the moon comes up

I never tried to walk the walk
Cause the steps are elusive
The membership is too costly
And exclusive
Hey, the more I've got
The more I stand to lose
So I'm gonna unpack my bags
And take off my shoes

And the sun goes down
And the moon comes up

Let me tell you there's no point knocking
At the big oak door
Can't you see that it's all full up

Won't somebody kiss me

I won't hold you down
You need a little space

Help me make a move, I can't stand the light

Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame
Lyin' on the floor I can't remember her name 
I can't stay here
There's something wrong here 
What's goin' on here?

Went downtown, had a long way to go 
How I got there, well, I don't know 
Found myself sittin' in a west side bar
Tried to leave but I could not go far 
High class woman try'n to give me a line
Should have left early when I felt so fine 
I can't stay here
There's something wrong here 
What's goin' on here?

When they closed up the bar, you know, they left me for dead 
I can't remember a thing I said 
Must have called the police to take me away 
They said, ""Forty days"", now I've got to pay 
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame
Lyin' on the floor I can't remember my name 
I can't get together while they're messin' with me

Hey you over there why don't you throw down your spear?
We all need some help right now
Where are we going from here?

What might have been we'll never know

The strangest thought occurred
I feel I ought to tell you
But it's clearly quite absurd

Wouldn't it be wonderful
If you could read my mind
Imagine all the stuff
That we could leave behind

How many words you waste
Before you're understood
Or simply sow some seeds
You'd do it if you could

Let me take a moment
Of your time
Inside you mind

I know what you're thinking
But I don't know what to say
The turmoil and the conflict
You don't have to feel that way

Look into my eyes
And feel my hand upon your heart
Holding us together
Not tearing us apart

To justify a crime
Compare it to an act of love

College cream, it always emerges
Be what you are I tell myself
And myself tells me we can't be anybody else

You always sleep with a smile on your face
Much as I want to put myself in your place
Not my business I've got dreams of my own
I try to recall but when I wake up it's gone

Don't let go of that image
You'll never see it again

Eyebrows raised was it something I said
A long hot night, it crept in like a thief
The engine stopped, the seat belt popped

Once of a dozen covered with stains
Blistered and stinking was all that remained
Cannibalized machines, mysterious bones
Unwanted contents of anonymous homes

So I got more pockets

I kinda went private
And then, aha
Such sweet seclusion
No more intrusion
Too much food on my plate
But there's guards at the gate
Such joy
I could almost die of it

Money talks to me
Lays it on the line
Gives me everything I want

Money goes to money
Yes it always returns
Finds its way back to the big house
Where it lives all alone
Wraith like silent partners
Operators of the system
Give words of quiet assurance
To an otherwise healthy victim

It's all coming back to me
I would swing in the trees
And I'd swim in the ocean
I used to show some emotion

I was not to blame
I feel no shame

Was there for the taking

That the uncontrolled appreciation of music
Was a danger to royalty

Looked like they'd get blown out of the water
They did of course eventually come ashore
As meek as mice or to be more accurate
As lambs to the slaughter

No time to think about it even once or twice
No second chances looking down the road
When there's the only way, only way to go

Oh it makes me wonder
What's going on inside my head
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under
Makes me forget the things I never said

I can't remember, I can't forget
Take it from me there's not a moment of regret
Since the day I learned to tie my shoes
I found it hard to spread the news

What's going on inside my head
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under
Makes me forget the things I never said

It's hard to swallow, it's hard to take
When I think about it now my knees begin to shake
Never came to me to mention at the time
Tell the truth it never crossed my mind

Oh it makes me wonder
What's going on inside my head
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under

Deep Purple,"Maybe it's because I'm only starting
That I think it won't take too long
Maybe it's because I can see you laughing
That I think you've got it wrong
Maybe I could be like Robin Hood
Like an outlaw dressed all in green
Someone said what's he gonna turn out like
And someone else said never mind
Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old
As all the cats I'd ever seen
I grew my hair and bought a suit
Of shiny white or was it cream
I shook and shivered danced and quivered
And stood on a mountain top
No one came from miles around and said
Man your music is really hot

Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak
My throat was tired and worn
My pretty face just looked out of place
As they poured on the scorn
I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king
He said my boy we'll have some crazy scenes
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about
He must've been the king of queens
Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done
But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung
There's a law for the rich and one for the poor
and there's another one for singers

It's die young and live much longer
Spend your money and sit and wonder
No one came for miles around
And said man your music is really funky

I believe that I must tell the truth
And say things as they really are
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth
Could I ever be a star
Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'
Everyone's shouting out loud
It's only the glitter and shine that gets through
Where's my Robin Hood outfit
Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye
No one ever cared enought to say goodbye
The money's good and the time you have
Fun and games galore
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten
And you wonder what you did it for
No one came from miles around
And said man who's he?",No One Came ['96 Remix]

Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place

No will but that’s like just emptied it

They've got the lot and god knows what they think that the deserve even more.
Psychopathic tendencies, they've got a lot of answer for.
Scratch my back and I'll stab Yours, no wonder it's a universal sickness.
Who are they, you well might ask, come with me and you can be my whitness.
It's a dirty business it's a crying shame.

He used to be cool with a glint in his eye but he lost it overnight
Spinning would change and things are rearranged and then Annie says to me
Nothing wrong with the way it was that's the way it's meant to be

Up the revolution we're all prepared to die
Up the revolution that was the battle cry

There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay

Annie was a die-hard rebel in the good old days of way back when
The cigarette was cool and all the kids in school could read and count to ten
Annie once said he had a few to bribe of that there was no doubt
He never could make us understand what the rebellion was all about

Up the revolution we're all prepared to die
Up the revolution that was the battle cry

There's gonna be Hell, yeah, Hell to pay
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay

Two-tone Annie drew up battle plans for making love not war
Everybody laughed at the fighting in the streets and behind the garden door
It came to nothing when it all went down and the band began to play

Deepspace 5,"When the moon shines at noontime, and the sun blazes at midnight
Dark and Night coincide, I stay inside and keep the lid tight
Catch side of the morning that passes by through my window
Another child is born, another dies, and still the wind blows
Spin slow, drawn into strong voice of reason
Standing there in soul thinking of summer ?
Just longin' for another season
For no particular Reason hear I stand-
Just rocked another show, just can't remember where I am
And my families far from here, but the stars are bright this evening
On this morning on this afternoon, just got here now I'm leaving
And I shall remember the marble just as clear as I do yesterday
Never dance with the Devil, 'cause I can't afford the hell to pay
When I blast through your speakers every time your pressing play
When I fish the phonograph so we could set the record straight
Dear god I pray-
Just let me show this world a better way
How you helped through to your heart and all the times you fade away
I get to, say these words and speak my piece to Catholic Crowds
Not certain if it's Day or Night but I know the time is NOW
And if we ever lose the purpose as a prelude to the sound
Lets just call it a Day, and burn my empires to the ground...

Ya, amazingly, Cask of Amanciatto
Cracks wide open and vibrates your bravado
So I escape, body-bagging, like I'm kinda like Monte Christo
World Tour, DL, Koffeshop, and I'm coming to your Bistro
We show bright when it comes to your ability
I'll be yellin' out homonyms 'cause I dwell in possibility
We gonna call it a Day, 'cause I know your feelin' me
Listener, Rapper, Popuri of Life- all synonyms of Cornucopia
I'm so glad you have a wife- In this wolf eat samurai world
You better grab your swords and saw your nads off
You'll get chopped off by the needle as it spins over to my rhyme, yo.
Rap Music guys have a self-title: artist to life
Please think twice before you say your things in the microphone
I might not be, but I take it seriously
When you really listen to the words, an your not just hearing me...

[Chorus]
Day and night
Wrong or right
Spill our guts with every breath on the mike
And hope you call it tight
If it's blind give it sight
If it's Dark make it Light
Some call it Music
Deepspace calls it Life

Workin' it out (out), placin' my feet to concrete
Hittin' the street with vengeance, steangence, so sweet
What bitter we consider every circle we pass
Probl'why the reason that I reason with class, so step fast
We pushed and finally pushed that was burnin' staying determined
And yearnin' 'cause the lessons we learnin' were life long (life long)
Its my song, I place to erase
And transpose all these average Joes
With weak flows-
Who knows not, -
The true livin' roles who ascended, blended
With the beat, compete, and apprehended
Today's feelin' all right, color all right
 Being blocked by the shotgun and pray every day and night
Now I've gone a full day without some wackness heard
The One's speakin' absurd-
Are finally heeding my word.   (ya right)
And now I'm left with nothing else to say
That be the Night that I Called it A Day (Called it a Day)

I'm gonna throw thoughts to a page
Let 'em fall where they please
Let 'em rise to the sky, rain down, on four seas
An ocean of possibilities that dwellin'
Yellin' at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon
A nocturnal being of love since the grown of time
Watch the sunrise with both my daughter's eyes
Permanent Shine, refine my reflection inside
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, and all glory given back to God

It was the Night that 24 turned into 12
Had to adjust my spiral off, from the top of the shelf
On the blank page, using the utensil of potential
I'm diggin' in my Brain so I could Rip the Instrumental
With 20 bars left, and I'm consistent from the intro
Lighting candle sticks, as the rain hits my window
Need to focus in, take the topic and let it flow
Got 8 down for the count and 16 to go
The Writer's blocks are stepping stones
Towards the metronome
I'm racing dead last
I'm head last
Placed on my prose
Nocturnal with my journal, a wordplay professor
The aggressor, resembling soda cans under pressure
I'm shakin' but not stirred, deterrent from my train of think
Now I'm aligned, readjusted to infuse the ink
I want to handcuff the hands of time
No great spirit here allotted for here's the sunshine...

[Chorus]

Bet I'm casting nets and dreads
The deep blue ways are wet?????
God's Silhouette, I want to palettes painted pink by suns and sets
BURNT from a long days work, but feelin' fine
Tip his cap and path the moon on his back, his day declines
Candlelight Switch as you slip into the evening
A courtesy to the sun, as it dips below the ceiling
Feeling sort of satellite, like the wind beneath my wings
Or the tightrope, or gravity keeps lunar kites on orbit strings
Man on the moonlight, dream before my time
Like the moon reflects the sun, I make the black begin to shine
Like the moon rewinds the waters, makes the ocean recline
I collapse your mind; I'm Syntax, but melancholy kind
Redefine the best, framed fresh in terms of holiness
Bless the mike, device, 'cause I get nice to keep the conscious
And I split tense mint's spit words like sentence fragments
Moon dust the must 'cause I ain't' in it for the cabbage
The incandescent presence spins, as I'm your present flame
But my name would flicker out my name syntax the wax and wane
For the name above names, I'm so glad that Christ came
The black bird bright the night, we called it a Day...

Shadows step on the one, on, under every tongue, run
Spoken sentence frags., spoken on shattered breaks
It's a black hole soul with my faith as I take

Break Minutes back with father time to coordinate seconds
I surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon

Villain threatened to sweat the syndrome of the wicked
Heading for your Auditory where the Listener would stick it

Fiction, we're steel, when it breaks from the construction
Crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption

Sunrays, like a score with notes my surfacing
Great mad at meteors or record the all heed

And when the, Sun Sets
Some one lets the mike down
We pipe down, unplug it and leave it hide down
But not before we retire the pen
'cause yo tomorrow we'll be back just to do it again

Uh, shackled and scarred
I still maintain my praise of dark days
A sullen world covered in pain
So from Dusk 'till Dawn, I represent his word

Deer Tick,"I am the guarded line
And you fill me in with whatever you like
I am just going through the motions
I need an old fashioned potion
There has gotta be some old recipe
'Cuz I gotta get drunk
I gotta forget about somethings
I lived in lies all my life

And I've been living here for a long, long time
And I know its been coming down a while now

I'm still hanging round and round
Sometimes it's a racket, but lately not a sound
In the bowels of history and time

I have learned to stay back and never shine
Now I feel stupid when I smile
For not a journey, a circus are our lives
I can't make up for everything I waste
And I know that I could never afford a taste
Of anything that your lovely hands make
It eats away before the soul brake

Just because it brings a smile to my face
Such a bad memory, you just can't erase

I'm kneeling, weeping
I will hold her dear
Oh, if your eyes water, you've got your favorite number to spin

And oh, what a crying shame, a crying shame

Murdered my throat, screaming bloody all night

Oh you should have seen the arches tumble
They're golden no more 
Now I'm smiling in my blood

I'm caught in a whirlwind
I'm going to heaven
I'm standing on trial and it's painted on canvas
An eternal testament to how we are so animalistic

And oh, what a crying shame, what a crying shame
What we became

When you're gone you're gone

Now can you smell the burning desire?

So please let me be lonely tonight
You know that I don't want to have to yell or fight
No I'm not the one to judge what's wrong and right

Deer Tick,"Elbows on the window sill
My head against the pane
You've seen so many grow and die
But you forgot most of their names

So I fire that arrow into the great big sky
And I hope that it never comes down
Unless you're coming with it
It's better with you around

I could drink myself to death tonight
Or I could stand and give a toast
To those who made it out alive
It's you I'll miss the most

But tonight I'll see my sweetheart
I've got a fifty dollar bill
But somewhere in her weak heart
She knows I never will

Oh love, it's hard to hide it
True love, it's hard to find it
Though I was once beside it
I've fallen far behind it

From a tiny room up on Smith Hill
It's easy to disappear
It's easier to run off hiding
Then say ""I don't want you here""
I can't stand to face the facts
It'd only leave you hurt
I don't care much for what you have to say
But I'd like to know what you heard

Deer Tick,"How can a man feel anything
When all he ever got was sympathy?
Take both your hands and put them round my neck
You're a fool for wanting everything
It couldn't be much fun being a millionaire to one
Cause a million's just a million of one thing
Cutting to the chase, I suppose there'll be a day
When all your tired hands will be put to shame
I've got a restless old woman standing by my side
She cannot wait for the finer things in life
She waited all this time so I suppose she has the right
But I drank away all the things I could provide
All of that aside I never meant to make her cry
But crying is just the baby inside
The ones that mess around that tend to fuss and bring us down
Tugging at your lips to make you frown
So my grandson will be living with a chip on his shoulder
And God don't listen to his prayers anymore
I hope he understands when he's a little bit older
That I always wished the best for him

I'm a brand new man watching her undo her blouse
I see my mama of a princess, though she herself was never a queen

Back when I was getting paid and I'm a lucky man
And then I got busy, and I'm messing up all my good things
I said. ""I'ma sweep her, oh, sweep her right off her feet.""
Now I'm sitting here afraid of my next move
I feel worlds apart from how she thinks I do
Sometimes baby, it feels like maybe I don't have any blood

Fixed on the living dead

sacando barriga en la puerta de los bares.
Un día más observan satisfechos
mientras con disimulo se pellizcan en los huevos.
En la calle, en el trabajo,
mirando a su entorno con cara de asco.
De vuelta de todo, pisando fuerte,
charlando a gritos con los amiguetes.
Atentos siempre al telediario
para interrumpirlo con sus comentarios.
Discutiendo por la quiniela
y a mi santa madre no la metas.
Lo paso de miedo los jueves con los compis de la mili.
Le pongo los cuernos a mi Maruja pero sólo con travestis.
Menudo Mercedes que voy a comprarme si me toca la lotería.
Que nadie me quite el cubatita al salir de la oficina.
¿Señores? Sí, señores.
Con ustedes: más señores.

Señores con traje,
señores de sport,
con gabardina,

Señores fondones,
señores fibrosos,
señores peludos,
señores graciosos.

Def Con Dos,"Buscando curro debajo de las piedras,
cansado de llamar a todas las puertas,
harto de citas con tipos casposos
que pasan de ti como de un leproso.
Y acudes a todos los anuncios,
rellenas formularios absurdos,
dejas tus datos, nadie te llama
y acumulas palmadas en la espalda.
Y en casa la misma charla:
""Vago, haragán"", grita la vieja,
""Ésto no es ningún balneario.
A ver si te ganas ya los garbanzos"".
Hasta que un día que estás en casa
mirando en la ventana a la gente que pasa,
te fijas, atentamente,
en las monjas guarras del convento de enfrente,
lo bien que viven, lo bien que se lo pasan
haciendo que hacen sin dar un palo al agua.
Y, ¡albricias!, se enciende la bombilla:
esta empresa no estaba en mi lista.
Qué torpe he sido, ahora caigo,
en la Iglesia nunca hay paro.
He visto la luz, ¡hip, hip, hurra!
Mi futuro está en ser un cura.
Ora pro nobis, ¡yeah!
Ora pro nobis, ¡yeah, yeah!
Y me chupo muchos años de seminario,
comiendo, durmiendo y rezando.
Me aprendo al dedillo los Santos Evangelios,
canto, medito y a veces me la pelo.
Hasta que me examinan y apruebo sacerdote,
me dan un alzacuello, un uniforme,
paga extra, un mes de vacaciones,
mi parroquia, mi cáliz y mis cuatro pobres.
Trabajando, trabajando para Dios.
Ahora las hostias las doy yo.
Y a currar como un loco para una gran empresa
multinacional que nunca quiebra.
Reparto bendiciones, desvirgo monaguillos,
sobo ancianas y me guardo los cepillos.
Un solo patrón, un solo sindicato,
director general: el Espíritu Santo.
Así que si no quieres seguir parado
aprende a ganarte la vida rezando.

Def Leppard,"On the first day of the first month in some distant year
The whole sky froze golden
Some said it was the aftermath of the radium bomb
While the others told of a final retribution
A terrible revenge of the Gods
But we understood the grand finale
Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before
So all that was left was

All the women were captured and chained
And national suicide was proclaimed
And new America fell to the ground
And all the children lay crippled lame

But all the nations came together
In fear of the thought of the end
No more would we fight in the streets
No courage had we to defend

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

A blinding light the sun had died a new moon took its place
Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman race
The city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend
A sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the end

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

(Too late) too late for love
Too late, too late, too late, too late

London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream stands before them all
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall

Too late, too late for love
Too late, too late, it's too late, too late

And there's a lady over there she's acting pretty cool

She always plays the fool

Danger (Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?

Oh he was locked inside a room without a door
His innocence he suffered for
In a world of black and white, they were wrong and he was right
Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true
He's going underground to track that danger down
Oh Billy, why you got that gun?

It could be your last mistake

Like a sheep in a lion's den

And the ghastly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall
Then a scream rang out like thunder, but the lightning was too late

When you're kneeling down to pray
And talking don't come easy now
When the words get in the way

Behind these private eyes
The truth would look so easy now
But I'm running out of lies

And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

I woke up and you were gone
Just one night without you
Is too long

Dying with or without you
Don't want to feel this way tomorrow

Everyday without you in my heart
Everyday I'm fallin' apart

Don't know what you got until it's gone

In your eyes like the skies
And the darkness will arise

It holds you in it's arms
And the light will never fade

And now I've seen enough to know
Though the truth can leave you cold
It can always lead you home
Back to the place where we belong
To the time when we were strong
When we could blow away the storm

In your eyes like the skies
And the darkness will arise

And the light will never fade

Confides and then defies, in case you?'re waiting.

And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible
I am invincible

You keep on moving
Running from your perfect past
Hiding in your broken dreams
Was never gonna last
A love looking for a sign
A shiver looking for a spine
Never let that feeling slip away

I am invincible
'Cause my love is here to stay
I am invincible
And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible
I am invincible

I am invincible
'Cause my love is here to stay
I am invincible
And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible
I am invincible",Invincible
Def Leppard,"Do you remember
When we used to dance?
Lighting up the universe
Living life for what it's worth
We took a chance

Do you remember
When we used to sing?
Shooting stars across the sky
A fire that would never die
It was everything

It was all that we wanted
And there was everything we'd need
We were gonna live forever
'Cause we believed

Do you remember
When we used to play?
We were right and we were wrong
Dancing to a different song every day
We were gonna live forever

Is this our last chance?
Is this our last try?
Is this our last dance
Before we turn around
And say goodbye?

Do you remember
When we used to dance?",Last Dance
