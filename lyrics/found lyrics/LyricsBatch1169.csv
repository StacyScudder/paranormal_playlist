Skrillex,"A silent heart ticking under the ground.
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found.
If you can hear me now why don't you recall.
I was the one who loved you after all.

A silent heart ticking under the ground.
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found.
If you can hear me now why don't you recall.
I was the who loved you after all.

A silent heart ticking under the ground.
Taking the weight of which has yet to be found.
If you can hear me now why don't you recall.
I was the one who cared after all.

A silent heart ticking under the ground.
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found.
If you can hear me now why don't you recall.

Skrillex,"To get a thousand miles from the earth
A rocket would need this much power

It would take far more than a human lifetime
But a space station might look something like this

To get a thousand miles from the earth

This much power
This much power
This much power

Yuh si we a bun dem up.
And load den we enta
Buss up di place, people all let off rockas

Check seh we a fren, dem mussy check seh we a star
All up na mi face, now get ready fi di war
Put bullet pon a punk a di mac-10 bizarre
Mad like a lion, now a time fi wi roar

To get a thousand miles from the earth
A rocket would need this much power
This much power, this much power, this much power

Play that song again, 'cause we were in love
Before, before the rain began
And if I cry-y, cover my ears

It was Emory 
Resurrected to Skull Duggery 
?Til I got caught the judge sentenced me 
Now check this to 7 years 6 months 14 hours 19 minutes and 3 seconds 
They couldn't stop me no matter how hard they would try 
You feel me it was do or die 
I didn't know if the Lord or devil was on my side 
Sometimes I had to look I (took a picture) 
So I took a trip to Texas got me a hit of heroin 
Niggaz rollies travels got me beyond 
>From the thought 
Do I have heart 
I ask myself these questions I have to start 
So I stay to myself cause I'm a forced to be reckoned with 
Living around all this bullshit in the darkness it's so hopeless 
But check do my life have a spritual meaning to I'm dead and gone

It's your nigga Skull Duggery.
Me and you together, we bout to tell em about the set up and the trap.
Feel me.

I'm the evolution of the Lord, the Lord made me in his own image
What, I'm gonna ball never fall
See, I'm tryin to elevate the mind rate
I'm a man, I'm tired of this shit, I'm tryin to get some ends in this situation that I'm in
Black women don't even know a black man
They gonna make it from am to am, cause we hustlin
Tryin to do it but the police they are bustin in
It's just a set up


It's a set up, a trap
That's why we act the way we act
They see us in Lexuses, Town houses, Benzes and Navs
Mama Mia, what you think of that

Naaah, they don't like that
Naaah, they don't like that

I'm all by myself tryin to raise my family
Knowing wasn't easy being both mommy and daddy
But I got down on my knees, and I prayed father please
Lift this weight up off my shoulders, whey them devils tryin to hold us down
Cause they want to playa haters crown since the beginning
Travel on gods earth with the intention of sinning
Spilling innocent blood and conquering all the land
But most of all trying to kill the black women and man
Separation keeps the household in disarray
That's been in effect since the days of slavery
Now all my sisters tryin to hold their head
And all my brothers locked down tryin to count their days
And all our babies wonderin around tryin to find their way
And everybodys gotta hustle cause we tryin to get paid
But for every cheddar knocked there's a road block
When it's goin stop, y'all we gotta keep fightin for the top
I want the pot of gold and the rainbow, I'm lettin my people know
Hold your ground firm through the setup don't let go

It's a set up, a trap

Mama Mia, what you think of that

Naaah, they don't like that
Naaah, they don't like that

Another black man strugglin, it's somethin strange or I'm wonderin
To me, how a black man can kill another black on these city streets
I imagine, how you do it, will you kill me
Feel me, I'm not scared, check it
Do you close your eyes when you scream
Do you hollar up the hallway, I'm comin nigga
It's somethin, I wonder how you play hard
Makin coke and heroin substance, yo God
Now check it, little girls see you smokin, the boys want to be you
Why you want to tell this shit to me, what you want to do
I see niggas like you every day
Fallin prey to your own way, it's just a setup

It's a set up, a trap

I have a testimony 
Skull I have a testimony 

[Skull Duggery] 
I must watch every rectangle triangle my front sides and back 
Niggas try to take me on a ride and leave me stranded black 
Leave me in spots where I can't fly jack 
Ain't that some shit how niggas come and fuck the game up quick 
I was there when G got popped uh dead in the neck 
Around the corner when Melvin got teked up in the chest 
I was up the block when my compadre Coolie Black got shot 
All up on Second and Clara Blocks now check it 
New change was burnin inside motherfuckers like hell 
The only precautionary measure was to take care of self 
And that's the only way you can survive in the game 
And enhance in the game but lord I really must say 
Everything has got a message and a meaning to it 
A purpose, if you don't believe then your day is coming 
Now I'm a tell you Lord, you've gotta overstand me 
Only thing I'm screamin see, uh

You can have my life instead of his, I'm serious 
The fear in me is I never felt this much pain in my body 
But you know what, I never drank that much bracardi, lovin his shorty 
Like she was mine and times I showed that baby the path 
And teach it, ain't no such thing just aim it when you blast 
Please be crazy bout your cash and learn to stash that last dollar

[Skull Duggery] 
In 1970 a hoodlum was born on this earth 
Didn't ask to come here but when I landed it sure did hurt 
It was a trip to see my life split in half 
>From the drug game on the street to the love I showed my mom and dad 
The pain run deep, ha, nigga can't you tell 
Look at the expression on my face, nigga it hurts like hell 
I have a testimony to tell, this life I will never forget 
Let me hit this life boy, rearrange my whole shit 
Look, I was riding up Third Street as usual 
I was gonna bust a left buck I'm on a cell but I left shampoo hotel 
Man it hurts me, scene it horrified me 
I seen a group of little kids having fun ya dig 
nobody botherin them see 
Until this chump drove up with his big shot gun 
And he shot a round of kids, I say boy 
what this nigga did (what this nigga did) 
And the little kid that he shot boy on the block, end his life 
And the kid's name was James ??? right, and that's my testimony 

[Mr. Serv-On] 
Now see in my life, it ain't never been what it's supposed to be 
Sometimes my tank dogs feel like they losing me 
Sometimes I just feel they don't understand me 
Cause in my life you never tell me life will bring so much harm 
I never thought to see my homie ??? die with needles in his arm 
And like my homie Derrell Fuller, he never got to see his twins born 
And by the way they couldn't see it because they bullets they took 
they couldn't take it 
And you couldn't tell me that these days in my life 
That I believe in the things that I saw 
Shit, I never knew I had this testimony

All I know is what we have is real
Words can't describe our love
That I'll say for sure
But if you can picture perfect
You can picture her

I could tell you that her heart is made of solid gold
That I'm a lucky man for having her to hold
Tell you that her touch could drive a man insane
But what's the use of talkin' 'bout something I can't explain

I can't tell you how she makes me feel
All I know is what we have is real
Words can't describe our love
That I'll say for sure
But if you can picture perfect

Every little thing she does makes me love her that much more
And every night when I come home I walk through heaven's door

Where we used to reside
Is slowly recalling
The things we discovered inside

Oh the crystal caves

We shed both our jackets
And I hammered brackets
From old metal chairs
To the walls, a crude set of stairs

To lead us down

And you tied a rope
To the steepening slope
A Jerry rigged harness
So we could descend in the dark

But the tide came in

And we found ourselves in the sea
Deep under water
We both found that we could still breathe
So we spent the day submerged

And we swam the evening away

The water was clear
Like the pure atmosphere
As we kicked and fluttered
Through caverns all cluttered with age

In the afterglow

We swim hand and hand
Over white satin sand
And you left a ribbon
To honor the pale gibbon moon

But that was years ago

And we never came up for air
Down there
We can go anywhere

The old world was dying
While we took our flying
Like peregrine falcons
Beneath the transparent blue waves

Far below the surf

And we spent the hours
With submarine flowers

That day in November

Felt alive again

And bring the spacecraft

His alcoholic father was too drunk to know or care
The rod not spared had spoiled this child - his only son and heir.
The city lights have pulled him southward - magnets in his mind
Where the streets are paved with gold and lady luck is kind.
""The boy only wants some attention - he's wasting our time
He'll never survive on his own - for he's no son of mine.""
There's thousands more just like him - seeking love they've never found
No hearth and home to call his own - our fox has run to ground.
His father taught him right from wrong (and beat him black and blue)
Caressed the boy with his clenched fist the only way he knew.
He never went to school that much 'cause he could not disguise
The weals and bruises on his legs - the rings around his eyes.
He only needed a family to help him to shine
All he has is a ticket to ride on the poverty line.
He stirs from his gin and tamazapam coma
To find while he slept someone has done him over
His things are all missing or strewn 'cross the floor
And he can't quite recall the events of the evening before.
As cars race by our young prince waits behind his cardboard shield
""OXFAM"" crown upon his head - his thumb a sword to wield
A shoddy-clad knight of the road - the quest is underway
Drawn by glowing street lights in the night - and smoke by day.

In this land where money talks we have little chance if any.
Bring the nation back to basics -
Lionize Dickensian dreams,
Hide a heart that's grey and cold behind an image squeaky-clean.

We're fighting to be free - driven by necessity,
She is the mother of invention.

Slaves three score years and ten,
Who never beg for divine intervention.

No-one dies in Cardboard City
Faces only fade away
Eat your pride and take their pity
Fight to live another day.

And did those feet in ancient times
Walk bare upon these lonely streets like mine?
Does God watch us from that penthouse high above
His children down below who live on air and love?
Wrapped in old headlines beneath this shop awning
I shiver in silence and wait for the morning.

No-one cries in Cardboard City
That would be a waste of tears
Eat your pride and take their pity
Like you have so many years.

Youth of our nation - A lost generation
Like lepers we march to the chimes of Big Ben.
Exiled and rejected by powers elected
Our cries from the gutter don't reach number ten.
Give us this day our daily bread
Before the headlines read ""bring out your dead.""
Chip-wrapper flowers are blown onto this cardboard grave
My spray paint epitaph upon the wall it says...
""Here lies the bones of some poor homeless vagrant
He died as he lived, in the shit on the pavement.""

No-one dies in Cardboard City
Faces only fade away
Eat your pride and take their pity
Fight to live another day.

No-one cries in Cardboard City
That would be a waste of tears
Eat your pride and take their pity
Like you have so many years.

And if I ever meet him then I think I'll have him stuffed
Look out of the window - see not one happy face

It's hard to even crawl
With your back up against the wall.
I find it hard to sleep at night
I feel that the worst is yet to come
Social helter-skelter
Ride the downward spiral has begun.
Are some people just born bad
Or is it how we all become?
Human termites driven mad
In the concrete mound of the rising slum.

The people who are dark fear the people who are fair
And hippies live in terror of the guys who have no hair
The saddest thing of all - what I really find grim
Is we haven't yet noticed what a mess we're all in.

It's hard to even crawl

Or is it how we all become?
Human termites driven mad
In the concrete mound of the rising slum.

The ""whether man"" says that the outlook's not great
A few outbreaks of murder with some isolated rape
I ask my doctor his advice, this is what he says,
""Get yourself some cancer boy, before you die of aids.""

Tell me do you like what you've found?
Are your thoughts like the earth spinning round?
Existence is pure pantomime
Why is life such a puzzle sometimes?

Trapped in a world I no longer feel part of
Each day is a thorn in my side
Though I've carried my cross - worn my heart on my sleeve
Still deep inside something has died.
If men have a sell-by-date I've just reached mine
Now we've come to the end of the line.
Why is life such a puzzle sometimes?

Well I just can't believe that it's happened again
Always knew that it would - just a matter of when
A lie was the last straw on this camels back
And just like Lot's wife I could never look back.
So maybe the reason I act so estranged
Is you still dream of him, it's you that has changed.

There since this building was made.
He's lurked in the shadows
From when its' foundations were laid.

From my ""double-helix"" he taunts me
His primal voice roars
It mocks my humanity
Turning the key in locked doors.

Sins of emission - an animal trapped in a civilised mind
Sins of emission - my formal facade for the deaf, dumb and blind.
Sins of emission - spilling my seed now the harvest is sown
Sins of emission - come feast on a banquet of blood, flesh and bone.

Though we try to deny
This primordial drive in us all
We will cease to exist
When we no longer heed nature's call.

I'm a puppet of lust and my instincts are pulling the strings
No, love's not an angel - it's merely a monkey with wings.

Sins of emission - enticing and thrilling
Sins of emission - the flesh is so willing
Sins of emission - down under my skin
Sins of emission - we're all ""in like Flynn.""

Temptation's the one thing we'll never resist
It flirts like a maiden that yearns to be kissed
Is throwing the cradle to hells raging fires
More sinful than nursing unacted desires?

Hold tightly the reins
Of your bestial instinct to breed
He's an unwelcome guest
In the ""house-trained"" existence you lead

How long can you muzzle this wild brute creation of yours?
You can't quarantine the primeval with walls, bars and doors.

Sins of emission - my formal facade for the deaf, dumb and blind.
Sins of emission - spilling my seed now the harvest is sown
Sins of emission - come feast on a banquet of blood, flesh and bone.

Ill mannered, foul mouthed, bad tempered and lazy
I stare at your world down the neck of a bottle
Every day is a death ride when I hold the throttle

To the drowning I am water
For your calm I am the storm
I'm the fiend who's with your daughter
In bed well before the dawn

Was I the cat that got the bird?
They'll put the blame on me
Everything was grand in wonderland
Till Charles Manson came to tea

Each moment's a game and I must play it to win
And if you cannot bear it then you'll just have to grin
All the world is a stage so I aim to upstage you

Kill me off but like ban quo I'll come back to plague you

All martyrs seek their cross and nails
The rebels grail his cause
So I'll just sign away my soul
And forget the buy out clause

Abhor, deplore, hate and despise me
I care not what you perceive
Fall unto your knees

With his best friends mack the knife
And the blue eyed boy who lives next door
He's a junkie Jesus Christ

Do you think I'll be sad 'cus you don't like me
Well, I consider it highly unlikely
Spill the milk but I won't cry
My eyes are watertight like my alibi

Yes, I'll love you then leave you for no apparent reason
My names are many my friends call me 'Legion'
The light that casts the shadows darker shades of black
That hide the drugged up mugger who will stab you in the back

I'm the one who was so bad he never got there in the first place

Skyclad,"I stare at fading visions now much fainter than before
Of the faces gathered round me and the clock upon my wall
My loved-ones stand in mourning but the china timepiece laughs
As it counts away the seconds (it knows all things must pass...)
From darkness into light
Still in my mind but out of sight
No longer held by space and time
I cross the fine dividing line...
That separates the dear departed from their final breath
The moment when my weary soul is born again in death
No longer flesh my carnal cage can keep me here no more
I leave my cell of shadows for a brighter room next door
I fracture the shell of this solitary hell
Embrace the unknown as my friend
Mortal barriers falling (the white light is calling)
This wheel of life spins without end
So up from the ashes a phoenix I rise
On a cord of fine silver my tired spirit flies
To a 'quickening' fetus (the new infant cries)
A bright spark ignites with each old flame that dies
The cycle continues - incarnate once more
I embark on a journey I've traveled before
I separate the dear departed from their final breath
The moment when your weary soul is born again in death
No longer flesh your carnal cage can keep you here no more
You leave your cell of shadows for a brighter room next door",A Room Next Door
Skyclad,"To whom it may concern (whoever that may be)
For I can think of no-one who has shown concern for me.
My last will and testament I now bequeath
To all those I trusted (to those who deceived me)

Though by hope deserted of this I am sure
That where I am going you'll hurt me no more.
While your plotting my downfall I'm planning my wake
Still you're trying to see how much more I can take

In this game that we're playing I know I can't win
And my dreams have all ended before they begin.
One for the wish that would never come true
Two for the kisses betraying a fool

Three for the life that was my bed of nails
For there's only one answer when all else fails.
I fear I have been here too long for my own good
Outstaying my welcome when all the time I should

Have heeded my heart when it said take your bow
But I'm sadder and wiser and listening now.
In this life that you're leading you're fooling yourself
If you think you are better than anyone else

So shed not your tears for me now pretty child
For when I was crying - remember, you smiled.
The knife that I'm holding was never as sharp
As the words from your cruel lips that punctured my heart

Tell me where was your friendship in my hour of need
When you stood and you laughed while watching me bleed?
One for the wish that would never come true
Two for the kisses betraying a fool

Three for the life that was my bed of nails
For there's only one answer when all else fails.
Don't talk to me of loneliness - don't speak to me of tears
For I have had enough of both to last a thousand years

""If music be the food of love"" then let a famine rage 
To starve my childish innocence before it comes of age.
One for the wish that would never come true
Two for the kisses betraying a fool

Three for the life that was my bed of nails
For there's only one answer when all else fails.
I beg you forgive me - I apologize
For wasting your time with such lengthy goodbyes

But as I depart - unto destiny kneel
I pray that one day you will know how I feel.
Goodbye.",When All Else Fails

No one has to ever know
What she doesn't know won't hurt her
As long as I don't let it show
And we'll keep it just between us

I'll be the way you told me keep it shy

Going crazy for a week
(Crazy for a week)
Your girlfriend's gonna freak
(She's gonna freak)

'Cause that the girl would do
It's so frustrating you know that you shouldn't be dating
No matter where I go or what I do
It sucks cause I wanna be with you you you you
Got a lame excuse to call you

Just to hear you on the phone
Talked a million miles an hour
Pretending we were all alone
And if only for a moment
It felt like you were really mine
But no one wants a cheater
Even if the boy is mine

Skye Sweetnam,"I saw my boyfriend hanging
with this girl that I hate
He didn't have to tell
why last night he was late
I can't believe what you tell me
Your lies have come undone
Now I'm living on the run
looking out for number one

I took a ride to the city
Had to get out of this place
I just can't stand the pity
When the tears fall down my face
I used to think it was over
But its only just begun
Now I'm living on the run
looking out for number one

One day you'll see me
but only when your dreaming
One day you'll say I was the one

I hitched a ride on a Greyhound
stashed away on a train
Bought a ticket for the subway
Playing guitar in the rain
I want to follow the rivers
to an island in the sun
Now I'm living on the run
looking out for number One

day you'll see me
but only when your dreaming
One day you'll say I was the one

Late at night start to fight
I just might think about him
Right now I'm feeling fine
I'm better off without him ya!

(One day you'll say I was the one)

One day you'll see me
but only when your dreaming
One day you'll say I was the one
I know that one day you'll see me
I'll haunt you when your dreaming
One day you'll say I was the one
I'm number one",Number One
Skye Sweetnam,"Once upon a time there was a girl
You wouldn't really call her typical
Had her own definition of cool
She lived in her own world
She had her own style, her own rules
She played along like it was usual
Nobody really even knew her name
To her life was one big game

She's got her head up in the clouds
Sharada Sharada
Don't know if she'll come down
Sharada Sharada
She can't get to bed

She's got that song stuck in her head

Dreaming all day, that's all she did
Ever since she was a little kid
All the teachers thought that she was slow
She was just dreaming 'bout her show
And when they told her she's delerious
She didn't care- she's just oblivious
She likes to make everyone curious
One day she's gonna be famous

Hard to know what to believe
Still I thought I tried for a while
Turning round and giving up is not my style
On my own on my own way

Bottled up is where my fears go, my fears go
I will never show my fear
They'll tear me up until my tears show, my tears show

You must try hard, don't give in
Keep it up and you win
Don't let them know they get to you
Put on a brave face and you'll get through
On your own, on your own way

Bottled up is where your fears go, your fears go
You will never show your fear
They'll tear you up until your tears show, your tears show

This journey of ours never ends
We will always pretend
Fighting not to let them win
And they're falling into our illusion

Tell me do you know
To me its dirt and blood and seed
That's how my garden grows

What is this pain inside
My veins they turn to frost
Is there an operation, please
And how much does it cost

This love is a scary love

If I had one day left to live
I'd lock the doors and windows
But keep you in
If I had one day left to live
I'd wrap myself around you
And breathe you in

What is love my love
Tell me why it burns
Like rage and fire inside of me
Yet causes no concern

I'm quite used to it
The ashes on my hands
At least I've felt the pain of love
But no one understands

This love is a scary love

If I had one day left to live
I'd lock the doors and windows
But keep you in
If I had one day left to live
I'd wrap myself around you
And breathe you in

This love is a scary love
Blackbirds in the place of doves
Clenched fist in a velvet glove
Like a train running over us
Like being nailed to a cross

Forging through the barrier to a
New dimension

Afraid to close your eyes
Afraid to fall asleep and to dream evil acts
To be betrayed again and again in
Grey-scale beyond the dreamers labyrinth

Turn around where you lie under
Supervision of emptiness
Perspiring and heavily breathing
Through screams inside

Hunted by your eternal enemies with the
Dawn as your heaven, your savior
All you fear is summarized into one nights
Torment of mental terror

I close your eyes, I make you disappear
Forlorn memories, At the border to insanity
I close your eyes

Distorted figures with forms from
You savage fantasy
Madness and sick surroundings create
Worlds that transform for every step you take

Waking up, disoriented and cold of sweat,
To a life to gain new experience from
Try to forget. To close your eyes for what
You have seen in dreams and then dream again",Awake

Never went to the drive in

When he finally put down his wrench

Leaning against the bench

She said ""James I have been waiting
For you to finish this car
It's taken you six years

On my hands and knees to make you see

Yes I've learnt my lesson there's no way I'm gonna roam
From the room above the laundromat on the dirty side of town
When the fridge is always full and the beers not watered down
Where they never lock their cars or punch each other heads
Spike your drinks with mandies or try to sell you reds
Where Clapton, Beck and Jimi are jamming in the sun
And the girls are very friendly I think I'll get me one
You know I've had a good time drinking my moselle

Seduced with just one look
The sun sets and the city lights up
The night flights burn the sky
As she reaches out for her sleeping man
She says with a smile

He might not recognize me anyhow

And my innocence is long gone

Ain't nothin' happenin' in this dirty old town
I need some excitement I gotta get down

We all gotta get up and go to work
Go home and cook the dinner

Since I've opened up that case
Plugged it in and gave the next door neighbours just a taste

And somewhere in the spotlight I think we came of age
But I learnt one simple lesson - No matter who you are
Maybe you can play that 1976 guitar

A black umbrella and a sad song in my head,
Buried your pictures that I loved the most,
‘Cause if you survived me I just didn’t wanna know,
So you can’t just come back now like a demon uninvited,
No you can’t just expect me to open my door to you because,

Should I throw my arms around you or kill you for real?
‘Cause I worked so hard to put the past to rest,

So you can’t just come back now like a demon uninvited,
No you can’t just expect me to open my door to you because,

I know I know I can sit and talk but I can’t make you listen,
You wish that I paid attention, I thought if I paid admissions,
To wherever, go however, it would paint the perfect picture,
You said ""no matter how much you f*cking make it doesn’t make a difference"",

And I’m im driving slow, driving slow, don’t let the piranha’s know

But you gon’ miss me when I’m gone,
Why we gotta wait that long?

I've burned my eyes on the summertime skies traveling a country mile
I drowned my pain in the winter rain and the sweetness of a smile
I've been possessed or maybe I'm blessed by dreams I can't define
But can't you see there's a light in me and I've got to make it shine

Oh, sweet Mary, Mary, don't you know
I may have come a long way but I've got a long way to go

I get through fire' I've been down to the wild just trying to find my name
I've soared as high as the wild birds fly but I still came down the same'
Now I may feel just a little more real but I'm still more lost than found
But when nighttime comes I still need someone to wrap my love around

Oh (oh), sweet Mary, (sweet, sweet) Mary, don't (Mary don't) you know (you know)
I may have come a long way but I've got a long way to go
Oh, sweet Mary, Mary, don't (Mary don't) you know (you know)

Skylark,"She's faced the hardest times,   you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world,   was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence,   in her ears

Let her cry,   for she's a lady
Let her dream,  for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower,   growing wild

And if by chance I should held her
Let me hold her for a time
But if allowed just oe possession
I would pick her from the garden,  to be mine

Be careful how you touch her,  for she'ss awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes,  you won't believe
The way she's always paying
For a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear and so she goes

Let her cry,  for she's a lady
Let her dream,  for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower,  growing wild",Wildflower

Skyzoo,"It's yours, the likes of which that you had never seen
Do it how you knew it, the influence never leaves
Your inhibition is kicking while they shooting up a scene
Come and do it to your pocket while they do it to their sleeve
Said to do what you believe, well we believe in more amounts
More around, more to find, more top cop, more to count
On it now, borderline mortified, stalling out
Take a leap of faith and lead the way into a smaller town
Town business like you found business when you brought it down
Borderline 'til a seven hundred forty-five brought around
And you 'round it forever whether you know it or stay away
You mount up together knowing you throwing a stray away
Thrown in a position to be lifted from a day away
Drumming like your heart beat, numb to what the song be
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

'Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists when it's clicking, you see that
Point out what you want and it's yours

Point out what you want and it's yours

It's yours, the likes of which that you already knew 'bout
Decisiveness is everything in shoot outs
The ills of the wills when the chill don't exist
And the risks become more than the rewards that they threw out
Paint the town mint green, the intrigue stays at the front
Same story illustrated from the jump, you know the wagers that they want
But retro's is a weekly occurrence
And I'm in mine now so my deterrence, is flourished
In irony, like either make a poem or make a zone
Become a flight and do what you wish you could do and make it home
'Til they teach you bout a throne and the leather that the seat on
Is from the same couch you got your feet on
Shit is more or less until the rest become a seance, you see on

Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

It's yours, the product of the environment you've confided in
Pressure bends knees like the side effects of Klonopin's
You deep inside the sea of the streets, look for leviathans
The beast pray on the weak, no repeats and no try agains
Silence, talk less and do more
No time to ask who is it
When knockers knock at your door
Put yourself in a position to listen
Or be a victim
Or another bad static of a tale in Baltimore
When summer falls, we spring into the winter
Recruit 'em at front and center
Move product with new beginners
So the package that we lend ya
Out of respect for ya father
Jell it all and have the money by tomorrow
Just do it how they taught ya
And everything will work if you believe that
Be careful, and watch for the feedback, you see that?

A lifestyle like no other how you want it
When you jumping out your covers then you cover what you're into
And pray to whoever you praise that you live through
Living for the light 'til the light becomes a signal
And signals to you as the one to empty a clip to
Then it turns round like the signals on the dial
And the lights hop up outta nowhere like they the cymbals
Cue 'em, and watch 'em get to moving like a heart rate
Looking for a dimmer, get to cooking all winter
And you looking more blizzard and this turns into a bar raid
Aight everybody, strip and get your your arms raised
Check day jumping, chest plate thumping
Freestyle to it, don't a neck brace want it
Soundtrack to the shooter, the soundtrack to it

This leisure needs to be civilized
Gotta have it, its already mine
Its already ours, its already ours

The smell of Rosé and a nickel plated glare
The bezè rotates while the middle make 'em stare
Heavy on the bass, let it kick away your fears
Heavy on the bass like the symbolism there
There like a cling on, fear like the ring on
That's left to the left of the fears that you swing on
Fall up outta pocket like the cymbal isn't there
Cue 'em, and let 'em find lane like the plug
And it u­turns to a pillow case and a rug
And the truth turns to the middle lane being plugged
And you dealing with the outskirts, spilling like a outburst
The doors shut and they forget to let you out first
The trap literally jumping and you stuck in
Being everything you saw when you wanted even more
And you think of how the lights wasn't bright enough at all
For the civilized leisure

They say sky your story don't ever change up
It never will, it's everything that I say it was
Forever will be centered on how we came up

Make the loyalty stay and let your name breathe

And you can hear pop on the daily 'til it's typical
Tying up the motives like my double entendres
Until my friends can tell you that I Lebron'ed them

As real as they told us to be when the lights get to us
Like do it right and them fluorescents might stick to us

Shout out to the left overs that left us those
Cheese grits like a remix how we stretching those
In ninth grade Pierre would keep his weapon close
I still treat breakfast the same, my friends still catch wreck with their aim
I'm still henny and coke, and speaking of
We was surrounded by it
And ducking all the jewels from the users on that diet
And we ain't have the heart to try it but saw the brave ones
And looked at that as a jewel on how they became one

By this race I've run
All that's left, is everything I want
And I'm slowly losing my time

Cause happiness comes from money
Happiness comes from money

Money makes us happy and, happiness is everything
And everything is now and, now is more than never and
There'll never be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so
If you can quote the prices of your happy then get at us yo
Get at us yo, learned it from right where you saw me posted at
Grew up holding on to it all unless there's hope attached
Cause me?, I don't hope for much, uh, if anything at all
They said your cue will depend on what you can bring along
So we was bringing everything that mattered to us most
It was money and it was cars and it was habits to keeping both
It was hundreds and it was scars and they just happened to be close
It was hunger getting involved so then it was back to being broke
And we just wanted a shot or 2, Melo on the follow through
Promised me it would open these doors the way that they promised you
So I just do, whatever it takes to fuck with it all
And enough to buy my way next to Jesus if I get lost, swag

And they say money makes the world go, money makes your girl go
Money turns some of its earners into something terrible
Ask yourself where did the person who was in the mirror go?
Why am I unrecognizable, so unbearable?
In the pursuit of paper, it was then I wasn't there with you
To do it over I'd have taken better care of you
It costs money for the birth, more for the burial
Purposely I'm saving up to purchase us a miracle
We want more but need less, desires and requests
I guess moving constantly at this rapid speed just
Effected my velocity, then the evil got to me
And strangely, it fucked around and changed my philosophy
I always heard it's not the quantity but it's the quality
In all honesty, past mistakes seem to follow me
Sometimes I feel like if my psychology will swallow me
So my apologies, what's my problem yo, it's gotta be the money

And we already had too much and so we was brushing it off us
In pictures in front of back drops til like 4 in the morning
In all of this Dapper Dan for all of your dapper adornment
Or its falling on the badge in the murder of pick a name
And my name fill the blank and I'm blanked and I drift away
And you kiss my cold cheeks, chicks crying like I was Cochise, would you stand up
And send me a slow speech?, because money makes us happy and, happiness is
Everything, and everything is now and, now is more than never and, there'll never
Be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so, if you can quote the prices of
Your happy then get at us yo

Dressed as opportunity, hand over the peep hole

Call it how it be but we'll never be with the belows
If we looking underneath then we looking up under seats
Now look up at your beliefs, and down at your wrist
Then you look up at what you need and blow it down on a flip
I'm just looking to get a key, the one for the door furthest
And the dream turned into short orders and tall murders
With a fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
Wishful in thinking where that ignorance can get you
Get us where we need and we'll call it even and leave

Skyzoo,"As I think of how to begin this, I already thought up the ending
And if the ending dictates the way the start of it’s written
Then I’m really rewinding what isn’t, get it?
Swear it gets harder to get it but when you got it
To get it again’s more innocent, it’s like product
Concealing the end is in a sense how lights got us
And sealing the win’s where it begins, it’s right by us
Labeled it type bias, to be one in the same
Or maybe they might buy us, to see one of us change
Or say that they might bye us, and leave us yet again
For a gain like pills on the banners of your screen
Know to handle the regime is the handle on the lead
And the hands do extend 'til a hand is outta reach
And the reach be the limbs that’ll balance out the means
And the means to it all will get a ski mask involved
And you winning or you swimming in a flood of the maroon type
Sheets by the dozen and you covered by a boom mic
Pardon, the most humble of an autograph
The threaded needles of desert eagles and honors raps
The high of thinking you can find more
The balance of the script when a shooter signs off
Ballerina fits like two inside four
All for the intrigue of a suicide door

Saw the doors lifting up
And then they never came down
I mean they rode around the block with the doors lifted up
Like they was flying off the ground
And then they told us that they call those suicide doors
They said they call those suicide doors
The break lights was 100 dollar bill green
And we was green for a suicide door

And as we take this to a further route
The steps move like its word of mouth
The steps move like if they was stepping with us when we further out
So step two becomes to work around
It gets lighter than a fly knit, tighter than a eye slit
Brighter than the writer you was bright enough to climb with
Complimenting you while biggin’ up me
Just brings us up to speed to the steps that we aligned with
Then it all ties in, tied up to keep down
Or cover up your eyes when it flies like you Dee Brown
The complexities of rubbing arms next to me
It all adds to these bags of longevity
It’s like, I’m Wayne Shorter with a ratchet fetish
Or, I’m Mendecees with a jazz collection
In other words, I covet what they covered
Like overflowing cupboards spilling gold medal dreams
And running to the cupboard like you’re gold medal breed
Or bred, and fed how that gold medal steam
Meanings all over, you can pick the one that suits you
Depending the tie the accessory could lose you

Black ice tangled til the loop is tied off

Skyzoo,"Uh, in my sweetest pursuit
Love is love but it never was easy to move
They tell me everything I love and I see what it do
They tell me everything I love but I need it from you
Uh, in my sweetest pursuit
Love is love but it never was easy to move
They tell me everything I love and I see what it do
They tell me everything I love but I need it from you

The more we run alone
The less we seem to move
The less we're on our own
The sweeter the pursuit

Good intentions at the root of it
Blaming us is only shaping us to keep pursuing it
Reaching for a dollar on a needle, get to looping it
Make enough to say you made enough when you was through with it
'Cause none of this is what they was pointing to when we saw them
But still in all we was committed to tryna see it
Like some of this is everything we have forever wanted
To get involved and to be living beyond reason, right?
Tryna keep it, and draw a tag on it
You know how we get it, right Duffle bags for it
The simplicity of banking on a victory
And putting your belief in a baton as the centerpiece
But it's one of those, and it's a ton of us
So when it comes to you it comes to every one of us
Treat it all the same and all of this will be different
To see what we became is to see what they all missing

In the spirit of tug of wars where love is lost
In the crossfire and something's drawn and dumping off
Half don't make it, the other half will duck and crawl
And turn Caine tryna save who remains
Raised as a JW and so the way I was laid
Is on a stake and not a cross, blood stains on the floor
Intuition will kick in and find a way to pry me off
I bring the stake wit me and keep it as memorabilia
Dealers is my audience, uniformed all of it
Made sense like as if I was there when they was offing it
Music for my friends, and due to my begins
I never shook the feeling of the mood that y'all was in
I never shook the feeling of the newest model Benz
But I stopped thinking that rappers and producers was my friends
'Cause its a wonderful world 'til they cutting out the odds
And it turns out loyalty just wasn't in their cards

My pursuit is on a pace of a shooter outta state
Where the heights are getting higher 'til they grew up outta place
And the lights are getting brighter so you shooting by the stakes
And your aiming get erratic tryna move em out the way
By the way, ain't a way that we can run this by ourselves
When we do it the pursuance turn the shooters outta shells
So treat it all the same and all of this will be different
To see what we became is to see what they all missing",Sweet Pursuit

Things I, should've told my friends
Thought we all saw it and, knew how this would end, yet again
Ending wasn't ever understood
Word to killing everything we could, and pray we're good

In love with living like a song of mine
But know that living off the love is only borderline
And the lines left to get across to get you more could get you lost
So they said to bring a cross like they was talking lines
Mapping out the most heinous of a way in
And you bottle your emotions like a weigh in
And waving at the thought of what they see in us, never really being us
Like we was saying hi but it was leaving us
The couple that believe in us is looking like the pair that we can stand on
And standing on your word is all that's left to put your hands on
My hands was on the wheel but we forgot to bring the cross
So all the lines that they was talking 'bout was more than what we thought
Pray to God that he forgive us and he fuck with us the long way
'Cause we just want the room screaming Stronjay, Stronjay
Word to all the Jacqueline's and all that we've attracted and
The fear that forgiveness ain't the only thing that matters and
It turns into the

And I'm perceived as sorta making it
Toast to all the imagery and all of the mistakes in it
Seeing is believing til you seen reciprocating it
Taught to hold the mirror up and never look away from it
And given what it means and everything that you can take from it
Holding out to try to find their place in it
And placing us with all the same motives but the motives got a way with us
Shame how they be lifting up away from us
And loyalty of standing with your day ones, banners with your A1's
Nike gloves rolling hand in hand with where you came from
Finger prints smeared, ambition in the air
Hands twitching and you drifting off the rhythm of despair
'Cause we grew up the same but I had a couple ringers
Like my pops ain't never leave and my moms did every scene
So the story we was shooting stayed similar indeed
But my ending might've shifted even more than we perceived
On a long list of

The kid who moms had two jobs while she was raising him
His pops got his hands dirty tryna make a way for him
Outside looking more alluring everyday to him

I'm looking too, I look at you like ""let me cook in that""
I'm cutting thru while you working to put your foot in that
I bust a move and serve you like ""where Brooklyn at?""
Right here baby, I'm right here baby
And your hand touching your stomach like ""you right there baby""
Believe it, sucker for curves and knowing the way to keep a curve
So you dressing up a plate is like the sweetest word
Sing a couple tunes, the aroma hit the room
Like if you was K. Michelle how you berserking with a spoon
Baby crazy at the stove top, oven door, dope spot
Snatching up a crown how you cut 'em off, close shop

If you can pull shrimp and grits, I'll be at your fingertips
Talking with your hands will have me listening for days
And tell your friends that all of my friends feel the same

A bowl of banana pudding is the dopest way to love me
You say I gave you the dopeness
I say I'm just whipping the way you whip at the stove and
Compliments in doses
Compliment the way that you was brought up by your mother
Like fuck it I never met her but I love her, tell her I love her
Telling you now how addicted we can both get
You strung off the long and me off of salmon croquettes
You be on your chopped, gourmet off whatever
Then you head to planet fitness and you shave it off your measurements
Calling it sweet potato pie the way you let me in
And even though I can't fit it all, there ain't a better fit

Double up throughout the day, double seasoning your style

And standing there's another little dream.
When you wake up in the mornin'
And you can't remember much about the night before.
A small reminder of the state you were in
Are all the tattered clothes across the floor.
And your head still keeps singin'
The phone still keeps ringin'
Remember just exactly where you've been.
'cause there ain't no doubt about it
There's no better things to see
Then what you've seen.

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory (Wham Bam Thank You Mam) [DVD]
Slade,"If this world were mine, I'd place at your feet
All that I own; you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
For with your love inside me, that would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
With wealth untold, you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me

And honey, you're my inspiration
I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me

And the sky would be blue
As long as you're lovin' me

With you here in my arms
Life is so wonderful

Give me pretty lovin', baby
Give me pretty lovin', honey
Keep on lovin' me
You know I need you, baby

Slaid Cleaves,"In the melting snows of Ontario
Where the wind'll make you shiver
It was the month of May up in Georgian Bay
Near the mouth of the Musquash River

Where the bears prowl and the coyotes howl
And you can hear the osprey scream
Back in '99 we were cutting pine
And sending it down the stream

Young Sandy Gray came to Go Home Bay
All the way from P.E.I.
Where the weather's rough and it makes you tough
No man's afraid to die

Sandy came a smilin', Thirty Thousand Islands
Was the place to claim his glory
Now Sandy's gone but his name lives on
This is Sandy's story

Young Sandy Gray lives on today
In the echoes of a mighty yell
Listen close and you'll hear a ghost
In this story that I tell, boys
This story that I tell

Now Sandy Gray was boss of the men who'd toss
The trees onto the shore
They'd come and go till they'd built a floe
100,000 logs or more

And he'd ride 'em down toward Severn Sound
To cut 'em up in the mills for timber
And the ships would haul spring summer and fall
Till the ice came in December

One Sabbath Day big Sandy Gray
Came into camp with a Peavey on his shoulder
With a thunder crack he dropped his axe
And the room got a little bit colder

Said, ""Come on all you, we got work to do
We gotta give 'er all we can give 'er
There's a jam of logs at the little jog
Near the mouth of the Musquash River""

With no time to pray on the Lord's day
They were hoping for God's forgiveness
But the jam was high in a troubled sky
And they set out about their business

They poked with poles and ran with the rolls
And tried to stay on their feet
Every trick they tried, one man cried
This logjam's got us beat!""

But Sandy Gray was not afraid
And he let out a mighty yell
""I'll be damned, we'll break this jam
Or it's breakfast in hell, boys
Breakfast in hell!""

Now every one of the men did the work of ten
And Sandy scrambled up to the top
He is working like a dog heaving 30 foot logs
And it looked like he'd never stop

They struggled on, these men so strong
Till the jam began to sway
Then they dove for cover to the banks of the river
All except for Sandy Gray

Now with thoughts of death they held their breath
As they saw their friend go down
They all knew in a second or two
He'd be crushed or frozen or drowned

They saw him fall and they heard him call
Just once and then it was over
Young Sandy Gray gave his life that day
Near the mouth of the Musquash River

But Sandy Gray was not afraid
And he let out a mighty yell
""I'll be damned, we'll break this jam
Or it's breakfast in hell, boys
Breakfast in hell!""

East of Giant's Tomb there's plenty of room
There's no fences and no walls
And if you listen close you'll hear a ghost
Down by Sandy Gray Falls

Through the tops of the trees you'll hear in the breeze
The echoes of a mighty yell
""I'll be damned, we'll break this jam
Or it's breakfast in hell""

And Sandy Gray lives on today
And he let out a mighty yell
""I'll be damned, we'll break this jam
Or it's breakfast in hell, boys
Breakfast in hell!""",Breakfast in Hell
Slaid Cleaves,"Sherry had a pawn shop band of gold
A sink full of dishes and a love grown cold
Along came a boy, pretty as the devil
She took his hand, the whole thing unravelled

There's no turnin' round, it's broke down

Billy took the ring, jammed it in his pocket
Drove down town and tried to hock it
Down at the bottom of Lake Ponchartrain
There's a love not carved inside a wedding ring

Broke down, cracked and shattered
Left in pieces like it never even mattered
Broke down, torn and frayed, ain't nothin' left you could give away
There's no turnin' round, it's broke down

Ain't no tellin where love goes
Maybe down where the black river flows
Won't be comin' back round, it's broke down

Baby in the back seat, and another on the way
Sherry thinks of Billy at the end of every day
Spends her nights waiting for real life to start
Listening to the sound of her double crossed heart

Broke down, cracked and shattered
Left in pieces like it never even mattered
There's no turnin' round, it's broke down

On the other side of town, two lovers lie still
Cigarette smokin' on a window sill
There's a picture locked up in an old suitcase
Billy closes his eyes but he still sees her face

Broke down, cracked and shattered
Left in pieces like it never even mattered
Broke down, torn and frayed, ain't nothin' left you could give away
There's no turnin' round, it's broke down, broke down

Was I the one who strayed

For these are the ghosts that run around in my heart

Slaid Cleaves,"There's an old dirt road, just off route nine
Fades into the lake, at the low water line
Sometimes I wander down that road alone
Remembering the town, that I once called home

I grew up in the valley, every neighbor a friend
Until the modern world started creeping in
One day came the lawyers, with cash in hand
They swore that our village would light up the land

The dusky waters move cold and slow
And the ghosts of a village still wander below
Homesteads of families and friends forever more
Haunting the valley below this sparkling shore

Surrounding the valley was a painted red line
Drawn by company men like marking a crime
A silent reminder that all inside it must go
Or be lost to the rising dead river's flow

Some folks too the money, started grinding gears
While the rest of us held out, twenty odd years
We watched our town, like a photograph fade
As the company came, to take it all away

They tore down the church, the schoolhouse burned
They dug up the graves, the wheels of progress turned
They got Dutchie's store, and Haven's pool hall
When the dozers rolled, it shattered us all

The dusky waters move cold and slow
And the ghosts of a village still wander below
Homesteads of families and friends forever more
Haunting the valley below this sparkling shore

Old May Savage stayed as long as she could
Her house on the hill towered over the flood
It rose up alone, in the dark of night
Its face on the water, the cold moonlight

I shake off the memories, on my lips a prayer
Thanks for the grace, and the beauty down there
And while the porch lights glow, all over the state
There's nothing but darkness, under the lake

The dusky waters move cold and slow
And the ghosts of a village still wander below
Homesteads of families and friends forever more
Haunting the valley below this sparkling shore

They haunt the valley below this sparkling shore

Stayin' out too many days at a time

I'm starin' down a dark tunnel and I can't see the light
Rats crawlin' everywhere, you know how they be at night
I got a gun in my hand, and I gotta squeeze it tight
I'm tryin' to get out of here, no one said it's easy right?
My stomach is queasy like, I got a fuckin' lump in my throat
More than a decade, I'm searchin' and I'm huntin' for hope
Soakin' in alcohol, smokin' usin' somethin' to cope
But how much water can you bail from your boat, 'fore it sinks?
My hijinks, made my eyes chink, pink from the lye stink
Pockets broke made want to rob things
Fuck this rap shit! My city's full of suicide kings
So from here on, this is now a do or die thing

I got a baby on the way, mad bills to pay
But I took too many God damn pills today
And I can't get out of this haze, out of my bed
Can't get these sick thoughts outta my head, I'm goin' crazy

I don't wanna talk shit, but this weed in my pocket

You can take a stab at me, and really get peeled maybe

I was always into drugs, just nobody caught me
I learned it from the best teachers, my family taught me
I got knocked went to trial, guess what that bought me?
The aura of invincibility, you can't stop me
My great grandfather was a doctor, his son was a doctor
Soon as I found pussy, I wanted to play doctor
In my middle school locker I had a bottle of vodka
Took a shot at lunchtime, sprayed my breath with Binaca
I'm no psycho, my sheet says I'm a sociopath
I enjoy prescription pills and blowin' that grass
What you callin' big cash, I would throw in the stash
That weed you saying's exotic I throw in the trash

I got nothin' to live for except a 40 cal slug
Waitin' up in the barrel I can take it in the mug

Slaine,"This is my life

I always knew I was different even back at six
They tied me to a pole with a rope and wrap my wrists
They punch me and kick me and slap me with sticks
In the ribs and the kids called my daddy a bitch
Said my father's a faggot, it aggravated my dealings
I didn't know no better but knew I hated the feeling
From laughing at me whenever they would crack jokes
On my way to the store to get a pack of smokes
For my Nana, Benson and Hedges 100 with a note from my grandmother

It's something she suffers from arthritis
Hands stuck together, drop down elbows
It looked like baseball, she called marshmallows
I could see the silhouettes of the past, hello
The days back when I had those rain tap windows
To peer through and just look at the world
I was just a boy, I never knew what would occur
Blur ahead to myself as a half-dead fiend
Fucked up in my head from what happened between
With my body on the floor I'm asleep from beans
My life flashed before me, I peeped the scenes

[Chorus]
Yeah, the ghosts talk to me in my head
They said I'm already dead
And I had so much blood to be shed
But I can't spill it no more
And I have died a thousand deaths
On the ground so out of breath
Yeah I've been down that flight of steps
But you can't kill me no more

It's a chain, we all grew up with the same dreams
But hit the potholes in the street and became fiends
Got in fistfights every night with the same team
Right around the time that ? came clean
I was hurt from my broken home and going crazy
Rolling up coke in bones and so I am maybe
One these troubled youth in this modern day America
Thank God I'm still alive, I gotta say it's Erica

Who's always by my side, that's why I love her forever
She knows my whole pain and all the stormy weather
That I been through, what I overcame and what it meant too
Other people looked at me like a freak with a pencil
I got enough rage for every page in my books
What I done I should be in a cage with the crooks
But I'm not, barely by the skin of my teeth
Maybe there's a reason, time for me to finish this beef

[Chorus]

It's the dawn of a new day and I've been given a platform
All the moments in my life, I got a rap for em
I gotta tell my story, bring it back for em
Either that or I could slip away and the crack's gone
You think I let it happen well that's wrong
Who would've ever thought I would be saved by a rap song?
I gotta capitalize cause I'm rapping with guys
That I idolized as a kid, I'm revitalized

Always looked at life through a writer's eyes
I learned this shit is hard, really man you either fight or die
So I'mma stand up and fight that fight
I'm going home broken bone and bloody tonight
You motherfuckers ever look and study your life
And see how fade and grayed they've made whatever you like
Cause I can feel it in my fucking gut when I write
This pain is sweet, I needed to be cut with this knife

Later they'll find his headless body in

Neurosis seeps like cement through the cracks in his disguise
In a dark bordello he cracked a mirror with his cries

In Hoboken the man said his
Case was lost
He was sent to the Orient
A double agent double crossed

He used to wear fedoras
Now he sports a fez
There's cabalistic innuendoes

Or is that a job you don't dare do?
Hey, my pretty flower, there's a letter for you

I know it's just another that you've written to yourself.

On the beat in all his parrot fashions.

Get in line keep in time with the Drum
Don't move your feet until the next beat comes -
One of the laws says pause between

Hey my pretty flower can you guess where I've been?
Can you guess at all?
Well I've been to your rooms and learned
You have all the mirrors turned against the wall.

On the beat in all his Parrot Fashions.

Testing nightly 'neath a sprightly summer moon

It can start with just a chance encounter - he doesn't know a single thing about her - a casual thread, but Lo! it led to love.
It takes too long to see what it takes two to love for it's soon to be.
And you could easily forget to get upset & set it free.
Sitting in a window at a table alone
Watching dancers circle to a saxophone - they get up to go, now they know it's love.
It couldn't be a nicer situation,
Setting off on a long Vacation - the passage is booked & they're both hooked on love.

My hero in wonderful clothes - passing me by,
Giving me the eye - he's my guy

From the start his message went
Straight to my heart & over my head -
It was heavy as lead -
I'd tell you what he said, but I swore
I'd keep it a secret.
There's something hypnotising
'bout the way he walks -
There's something supernatural
'bout the way he talks -
Coming from another world I know
He doesn't find it easy -
Keeps me up every night telling me
The same old story -
I told him it's alright no matter
What he does he never really bores me.
Strike a light!
He's making my daze into night -
Mercurial man, he does everything
He can
& my only plan
Is to keep his secret secret.

To leave our lives behind
Wife, child, credit cards
Get in the car, good-bye
Got stuff packed in the trunk
Pulled the plunger and closed our eyes
Whatever lane, left or right
It'll be the trip of our lives

Be the ball - Life is one big arcade
Be the ball - The aim is to be the game
Be the ball - The nest four minutes are a total surprise
Be the ball - Hell-bent, damn, we learn drive

Through the pits and valleys,
Through the tunnels in the maze
We don't know where we're going
But we got the Stones cranked
As fast as the orbit takes us
Is just how fast we'll play
Around the bumpers and
Down the drain
We're so out there, we feel no pain

Be the ball - Don't you try to set your sights
Be the ball - You'll never get it right
Be the ball - Gonna see the world tonight
Be the ball - Hell-bent, damn, we love to drive

We love to drive
Drive

Be the ball - The last four minutes we quite a ride
Be the ball - It's too late to change our minds
Seen it all - We are so amazingly high
Be the ball - Hell-bent, damnit, we love to drive

I hate everybody but you And it won't get better soon You rub me all the right ways baby You'll probably screw me too

When you were told you're too old To strip to pay the bills You moved in with your loser friends So you could take designer pills Take it how you want it Scream that you were framed Cause you beat My sister's looks and all But the sex is just the same

I hate everybody but you And it won't get better soon You rub me all the right ways baby You'll probably screw me too

Give it up, you still want more I'll fight you to the end, you still want more I put my heavy faith Into a karma sucker's safe Give it up Give it up

Pieces of the son-of-a-bitch Float around the crowd He wears his bad intentions like a cape or a shroud Then he blew his mind on Drano From his third story hotel room Yeah he missed the pool by inches So he won't be walkin' soon

They loved you
Now father don’t deny
You took them like a sacrifice
We finally know the truth about you

You’re unholy
So vile
How can you justify?
Oh my, how they loved you
Oh yeah

Slash,"Last night in paradise
I can feel it down in my bones
Left the good all behind
Now I die on the vine
Waiting for my redemption song
I am never safe
Just a walking bomb
In a midnight rage
Then I'm gone

I'm getting off this wicked stone
'Cause I can't say
And I can't deny
That all I want is lost
No I can't face
Another night on this wicked stone

I rolled and tumbled down
And I curse 'till the morning light
From the mountain I fell
To the depths of hell
I was distant and born to find

Once a rolling stone
Now a falling star
Was so close to home
Now so far

I'm getting off this wicked stone
'Cause I can't say
And I can't deny
That all I want is lost
No I can't face
Another night on this wicked stone

Now, you might say I'm good for nothing
And I might say that you are right yeah
Can I crawl away from this ball and chain?
It's got me tethered to a world of pain
I'm digging my own grave this time
On this wicked stone tonight

I'm getting off this wicked stone (I'm getting off, this wicked stone)
'Cause I can't stay (cannot stay)
And I cannot deny that all I want (all I want)
All I want is lost (it's gone forever)
No I can't face (cannot face yeah)

Stuck out of view
You had your time, but now your moment is all but gone

Oh it's gone

Lost in a daze, what have you done?
Diggin' a grave to be your own
You're soon to fade, but just too blind to let go

Or my beautiful disaster take me anywhere you choose

Don't fight it, ignite it

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
You may never be this good again

It's like a new religion speaking tongues
come see the light
Do not trip on inhibitions that will only waste my time
Let me tempt you with the evils of the flesh and so much more
Like a Babylon redeemer, like a pusher, like a whore

Just try it, you'll like it
I'll give you more

I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
You may never be this good again

It's so dark, I can't see
All the truth inside us
All I want is to feel something that's real before the end

Close the door
Turn the key
Do you like
What you see

Kill the lights
Oh come to me
Set it off tonight
Baby just like fire on gasoline

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge

Slaughter,"Want to tell ya a story that happened to me
There was this old man started chattin' with me
He sat by himself on the side of the road
A cowboy hat and them pointed toes
He said, hey son what do ya do
Ya better pay attention when I'm talkin' to you
I've been around here for a long, long time
Could have bought this land for damn near a dime
(Right over there past that gas station over there, see it)
So I headed on over, leaned against his truck
And ya better hear me out or you're shit outta luck
I've been through times that you wouldn't believe
It makes a man feel about a hundred and three
Again he asked, what do ya do
I can't imagine by lookin' at you
Boy, things have changed since way back when
I wish that I was back in my teens again
I said hey, I said hey, to what the old man said
So we hopped in his truck, went for a ride
He talked about things before I was alive
Ya know, that used to be a big mining town
My brother and I brought that mountain down
My oh my, look how they built over there
Have ya ever thought about cutting that hair
Ya never told me what do ya do
Tell me kid, are ya just passing through
You say hey, you say hey, from what the old man said
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to speak my piece
So, low and behold when all was told the only listening one was me
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to break on through
So, low and behold when all was told the stubburn one was he
So the moral of the story is ya gotta learn a lesson
Especially from a man who got a Smith and Wesson
Ya better learn with your ears and not with your eyes
Or you'll be dealt a big surprise

I've been around here for a long, long time
Could have bought this land for damn near a dime
(Right over there past that gas station over there, see it)
So I headed on over, leaned against his truck
And ya better hear me out or you're shit outta luck
I've been through times that you wouldn't believe
It makes a man feel about a hundred and three
Again he asked, what do ya do
I can't imagine by lookin' at you
Boy, things have changed since way back when
I wish that I was back in my teens again
I said hey, I said hey, to what the old man said
So we hopped in his truck, went for a ride
He talked about things before I was alive
Ya know, that used to be a big mining town
My brother and I brought that mountain down
My oh my, look how they built over there
Have ya ever thought about cutting that hair
Ya never told me what do ya do
Tell me kid, are ya just passing through
You say hey, you say hey, from what the old man said
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to speak my piece
So, low and behold when all was told the only listening one was me
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to break on through
So, low and behold when all was told the stubburn one was he
So the moral of the story is ya gotta learn a lesson
Especially from a man who got a Smith and Wesson
Ya better learn with your ears and not with your eyes
Or you'll be dealt a big surprise

(Slaughterhouse!) My real name, my rap shit
No made up nigga, I'm straight up, nigga
Still in the projects where I came up, nigga
On a scaffold doing ten sets of ten, getting my weight up nigga!
I'm no shooter, but my shooters'll have your brain exposed
But I'll shoot five in a second, homie, and break your nose
Talking past, I'm dead ass, I was living life fast with my pistol in the grass
Digging in my ass tryna finish up the last so I can sit it in a stash
Old E. sweat dripping from the bag
Milk crates sitting on the Ave.
While I'm looking left and right for them niggas with the badge
My mom's dishes really had crack on 'em
12 12's and I kept that shit packed for 'em, yeah they came back for 'em
I can paint it so vivid cause I really lived it
If rap fail, I stack bail, and show you how to get it!

I'm in the club, bottle in my hand doing my two step
While I got my gun in my pants call it the hammer dance
Uh, bitches dancing on a nigga when they feel the gun
I tell 'em we doing the hammer dance
Uh, two steppin' with my weapon on me
You good? I'm just checking, homie
Uh, fam-a-lam, you don't stand a chance
While I got this gun in my pants doing my hammer dance

In these LA times, I wake up on one
House slippers and coffee, I know the paper gon' come
I drop shit that make the gangstas go dumb
Keep a bad bitch naked like my waist with no gun
Uh, I'm for real, how are you?
Got street power, from the Watts Towers to Howard U
How would you become me? I don't do what you cowards do
Flip a thousand pounds of that sour diez' in a hour dude
I'm out my muh'fuckin' mind
Fuck a punchline, salute my muh'fuckin' grind
Ditching feds on the regular, they're trying to catch a predator
Not the Chris Hansen type, but the Danny Glover kind I'm a killer,
Everybody know I body your audio
When a shotty blow, say goodbye to your barrio, you maricon
You don't think that I'm about this
Ice grill, nigga, put your money where your mouth is

While I got this gun in my pants doing my hammer dance

My real name, my rap shit
Fuck with Chase, but the real bank is the mattress
Money ain't new to me, been getting G-stacks
Since Smoove B took his shawty back from rehab
Knife work with me, but the chrome is extra
Case I'm in the same taxi as the bone collector uh!
Y'all rappin' 'bout models, I get hounded by 'em
Not a killer at all, I'm just surrounded by 'em
Just a real nigga, straight from my mother's stomach
Ain't enough cloth for all of us to be cut from it
Not decided by who toast led
Cause all of us would be angels for Pujols' bread
Lot of hostility, hollering is killing me
Screaming ""Over my dead body,"" like it's not a possibility
On my Jers' bullshit, never mind me
But if it's ever problems, niggas know where to find me

Woo! Hello hip-hop, goodbye music

It's like a love-hate relationship
Ridin' in the Ferrari while takin' trips
Compared to beer takin' sips
Sittin somewhere in a Camaro with racin' strips
Either way you embrace it
Can't no amount of money or lady replace it
And after all this rhymin'
If I refer to you as a girl niggaz'd call this Common
I'm through as a fan
No disrespect to music, I'm talkin' to you as a man
How the FUCK is you flossin a Benz?
Listenin' to this nigga Rick Ross dissin' 'em
Jim Jones dissin' Jay
This rap shit done gone a different way (that's right)
I know my lawyers play the lies game
It's okay for Soulja Boy to say Nas' name
Nothin but Ludacris answers
The game backwards like dancers
Shootin' on the same dance floor you grew up and answer
To them shooters, now them shooters is dancin'
Fuck you too!
You corny so I gotta cut you loose
I looked in my book of rhymes, took the sign
I swear I heard a few of my nigga Crooked lines

I got these A&R's heart racin'
Got 'em in fear of me sonnin' they flagship artists for spittin' {?}
This is bar raisin
I'm raisin the bar so far tryin' to look at it's equivalent to star gazin
Think I'd rather be waterboardin', you feel me?
Than to listen to what y'all recordin, for real G
Hell naw, I will not support it
Rather switch places with the child mom's aborted, kill me
My skills be on point like a flyin' dart
Sometimes I feel like the messiah of a dyin' art
A whole 'nother animal, not the kind that departed on the giant ark
But a vulture with a lion heart
I eloquently breathe fire
I speak for the Eastsiders like I got a Long Beach speech writer
And I could teach riders how to do they thang
So they won't ruin the game for comin' off lame
We could be birds of a feather, what does it mean?
Think about it, that mean I put you under my wing
Or I'ma leave this hip-hop thing to all you wack dudes
Cut you loose (you're no good I have to) cut you loose
Call me a hater when I'm tellin' the truth, expect it
SoundScan is unveilin' the proof, respect it
Here's somethin' you could never dispute
The last time I spit a rhyme the roof fell in the booth, I wreck shit

Man I feel ruined inside
Somebody tell me what to do, I'm a guy
That loves music but I am truly through with the vibe
Sometimes I wish it was dead, rather than look this stupid alive (word)
I found out I been persuin' a lie
It's nothin' like, what I thought, man the proof's in the pie
Cause ain't no puddin' in the hood when niggaz shoot to survive
But what's my single? Ask dude in the suit and a tie
Who stole the whip? Man I'm losin' my drive
I 'member when singles used to have cuts on it
Nowadays the rewind button got mad dust on it
Can't bring it back if it's wack, when they come back then it's crack
I'm fiendin' for somethin' good so I can puff on it
Y'all don't even give me a buzz
I can't enjoy a glass of beer if it's really just suds
Nothin' there but the air in y'all heads
Man I'm fed dawg, I had it up to HERE (done!)
I'm cuttin' you loose, fuckin' abuse
I can't believe they in your talks when you discussin' the truth
These dudes suck and they bad liars
This is not what I expected when I was 11 steppin up in rap cyphers
(What's goin' on?) I thought you had to be mad nice
But apparently you could be trash as long as you look good and have ice
I ain't complainin', I'm just sayin' though
There's no reason a musician should wanna watch a television 
Instead of be listenin' to the radio
I'm cuttin' you loose

Look, I used to dream of just bein' wit'chu
Woulda probably gave whatever to be seen wit'chu
On the block on the scene wit'chu
And the most beautiful thing wit'chu
Is we shared the same passion and I could get cream wit'chu
Not a qualm, not a problem, not a single issue
Then we started arguin', havin' single issues
Somethin's off nowadays, you don't seem official
SO! {""You're no good I have to cut you loooooose""}
I see you with them other artists and it's sickenin'
E'rything's changed since we parted, you been different
Do whatever for bread boo when you started trickin'
For real though {""You're no good I have to cut you loooooose""}
How you could thug me?
If I can't be me when I'm wit'chu, tell me how could you love me?
(How you) Get so ugly, eat it, beat it, treat it better than niggaz
So you still be dyin' to fuck me, baby don't interrupt me!
Ain't complete tryin' to compete but you judge me
What you really think of me, you disgust me
I twelve-step my addict itch
So Method Man, you could have that bitch
But now she got neighbors against me, still her favorite MC
I just hit her hard and she got papers against me
It's cool; I get up wit'chu later if meant be
Just text them old heads, tell 'em mate with they memories

Where I'm from they don't hesitate the cannon that spits
Stand by the wrong man and watch your thoughts land on a fence!
I'm the voice of the gutter where your boys serve your mother
And the noise from a clucker puts your boy on a cover
We annoy undercovers cause they never put on
We from the hood, we don't snitch boy we weather the storm

I'm comin' with flash just to blast your face mask
Bullets flyin' faster than the NASA spacecraft
Get half your face smashed by the click-clack

Might injure, your nine endin' your life when it's the
Prime miniature time witness the prime
Innocent lives kissin' goodbye, picture the I, givin' a fuck!
The truth (walkin') just walked in the booth (talkin)
Too (often) I put a hot beat in a new (coffin)

You lookin' at the prime suspect, with enough stress

Obsessed with who I struck next so I set it for
Success when I spit cause the vic is my next metaphor
Self-destructive mixed with light lies
If, you lookin' for psychotic, I got it

And I observe while the whole world tries to act reserved
Need a Oscar, I'll put on an act that's superb

Try and run with our wave
But I'm cool with bein' Eddie Levert seein' my son on stage
Gun gon' blaze, act up in this joint
And I'ma be Nate Robinson and back up the point
Your run's over, run with us or get run over
I'm here to save this shit, and I brung soldiers

This is lyrical murder
Me and every track have a physical merger
When I stab it in the chest I'ma bit of a curver
So it bleeds to death, like the middle of a unfinished burger
Or sometimes I wrap my hand around his throat
Cause he think his kick is slick or his little snare is dope
Shoot the bass in the face but sometimes I carry a rope
To hang the piano keys when they hittin' every note
I'm what no beat's able to withstand
If you suffer from writer's block and your label got big plans
Listen to this fam
Slide a little dough out that budget, and hire the instrumental hitman

When I'm kickin them flows on that microphone
The illest nigga that's holdin' that microphone
I put my heart and my soul in that microphone
I put it down on that (microphone)
Turn up the motherfuckin' sound on that microphone

And if eatin' niggaz made you obese, I be The Blob!
Fuck props, nigga this a different conquest
Listen this hear me spittin' think it's a pissing contest
I'm in it for power, if cowards try to stop me
They better off usin' a fishin' pole to reel in the Lock Ness
Yes! I got a barrel that'll spot wussies
If you are what you eat, how come I'm not pussy?

You lil' niggaz better come off that microphone
I'm educated but I'm dumb on that microphone
Don't even bother, you'll be done on that microphone
I turn a father to a son on that microphone
I'm a revolver in the slum on that microphone
And tell his are's I don't need no microphone

Too many frogs go ribbit but never leave lillies
I get it poppin like a ineen milli{?}

None of you kids spit evenly
You body my verse is like a thick bitch leavin' me
Ha ha, too many fantasies and no fame
Too many claimin' insanity and they so sane
Less than wack Scooby Snack lack flow game
Rappers everything I do be that crack cocaine
Your career is doobie wraps, slap Joe name
In any one of them verses say hello to the hearses
Too many monkey see, monkey doers
I slaughter pigs on my tail like Punky Brewster

Niggaz know I get it in on that microphone
Y'all don't know where to begin on that microphone
I don't see how y'all could win on that microphone
A pioneer, I set trends on that microphone
Decide who you wan' be on that microphone
I see a bunch of lil' me's, micro clones
Too many 20 milligram Vic's I'm on
Killed the web, it don't matter what site you on
Save his mouth 'fore he's runnin' off
I tell 'em bridge or a tunnel, give a fuck how I come across
All these wanna be tough guys, son is soft
Gun go off, havin' like a good show, just spun 'em off
Treat old-timers like fags who drop the soap
They mic got Alzheimer's, forgot that they was dope
Too many dogs, not enough barkin' yet
Too many blueprints, not enough architects

Fuck record sales or who the machine markets best
I'm the last muh'fucker that y'all should test

Why you so scurred? I'm only a giant
I do it late night, call me Conan O'Brien
And the nose on my gun look like Pinocchio lyin'
Last king to Scotland sippin' good liquor
If you're Meagan Good, I'm Forest Would-dick-'er
Oscar winner, Oscar wiener
If you're flow's Aquafina, I'm Katrina
Uh, y'all say that your pockets are big
I'd rather say that I'm 'pac mixed with big
You're lookin' at a microphone rocker on vodka
That's why I be walkin' awkward, ya dig?

[Chorus]

(Joey!) look, forever had to warm him
Take him to the cleaners, plastic bag on him
I ain't like y'all, I don't like y'all
Put him in lyrical jail with suicide thoughts
Kick the chair hang him from his mic cord
What's the fight for? never back down
I'm on some bullshit, quick sippin jack now
Royce on Patron, crook got the chron'
Guess what I'm tryna say is leave them boys alone
How you got hope, had nothin' to prove
And had nothin' to lose and now we got both
Celebration bitches, now we got toast
But with no ratchets, Joell go 'head attack it, uh

Real nigga, rhyme spitter, hoe bagger
Boast swagger, flow dagger, hip-hop toe-tagger
No slacker, I could chill but I'd so rather
Eat a nigga cause he's sweeter than a glass of Goldschlager
Poor rappers, here on y'all won't matter
And I'm out braggin' every interview so you mo' matter
I'm the man in the booth
With (a few good men), and ""you can't handle the truth"" (no!)
And y'all could say I'm nice but I'm not
I'm mean, flow coke with ice in the pot
The fiends gon' go broke, they dyin to cop
My team is so dope you like it or not!

I'm tryin'a have a rich bitch like Paris Hilton
That like to get her ass smacked like Keri Hilson

[Chorus]",The One
Slaughterhouse,"(Ohh!) Yeah (let's go!)
I said once upon a time in a city that's mine
There was a nigga named Nickel that spit like Big in his prime
He got a fifty two box, original tick in the mind
Listenin to 'Pac and them drop with a prestigious design
My niggaz is dimes, my bitches is dimes
I came up behind Eminem in '99 and I took the baton
I been runnin' shit ever since then, slaughtered MC's
Sit and watchin 'my green grow, like I'm waterin' seeds
The problem with me is I'm the heart of the streets
Niggaz callin' for peace, they can't even call the police
If I ain't better than you I'm harder to beat
Probably cause I live by the art of for-keeps
I get indicted after my product's released
We a different form, a different centrifugal force
Every line is like grippin' on a stick shift in a Porsche
My niggaz asked for direction to go on this track
I said fuck a direction, spaz out! Get 'em up high!


And for them wack songs that you made
I want you to throw your pin, but hold the grenade
Explode to your grave, and go straight to hell 
When your soul is enflamed for the road that you paved
The role that played, in fuckin' up hip-hop
You owe so you paid, the fo'-fo' close to your brain
Closer than the close shave of a low fuckin' fade
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with J-O-E
With Nickel we gon' make more cheese
Heavy hitter, call me Joell David Ortiz (what up!)
I point a burner at the plaque on your teeth
On some leftover shit, it's a wrap on the beef
I'm one in a mil', comin' to kill
It's like you wanting a pill, my gun put your back on the streets
Spine on the concrete lookin' at the sun
Eyelids heavy, ""Why did Crooked have to come?
He was full of 'gnac and rum, like a bully actin' dumb""
Fully-automatic umm, that's Crooked havin fun
Listen, don't make a nigga find your dame
And make the dime give me brains 'til my mind is drained
Listen, don't make me grab a nine and aim
And how your dime did me, do yo' mind the same
But different, the West Coast king Crooked I
I'm a kamikaze pilot, I stay fly 'til I die, get 'em up high!

Here we go again, you know I'm him, Mr. Ortiz
Soon as I hold a pen I co-defend the sickest MC's (Slaughterhouse)
Pick a disease we got it, I vomit sniffle and sneeze
Lyrics squeeze, listen please, Lord help get rid of this fever
I'm like a hundred and fifity degrees
sixteen's used to be sweet, now they're a bit of a tease
A nigga need a infinite instrumental just to be pleased
Used to dream about livin' now I'm livin' my dreams
The bitches fiend, made my dick a machine
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I am just as fuckin' big as I seem
When I'm spittin' this mean, me and government intervene
A couple presidents, literally live in my jeans
I give 'em residence, they just let me pick anything
When I'm in the mall, they show me the latest kicks on the scene
And I get 'em all, I ball like the nigga I am
Niggaz hate, bitches (Cheer) like Norm, Cliff and Diane
I'm in a state, of mind that should be the fifty verse
I run radio, but I don't use them itty bitty words
I ain't shabby with the nouns, I ain't shitty with the verb
When I reach heaven I want the nigga Biggie to be like ""Word""
City slicker, New York delivery when I swerve
Hold that mic like the Statue of Liberty, I deserve
A shot at the title, 'Spitter of the Year'
E'ry year, let's be clear, put some fingers in the air
And hold 'em up high! [echoes]

Work on your half-court shot, I'm money from far
Get 'em mad, see a ape on your monkey bars
And that's rate, gettin' hate from the wannabe stars
And that's great, mean he feel it and know he numb
See that bullet comin' from around the corner 
Like a shot from Angelina Jolie's gun; think Joey the one
I'm a fake? Ain't your run-of-the-mill
I'm from where they kill you for one of your bills
For me it's fun, your man think we evenly skilled
He Mel Gibson, all that shit he believe, gon' get his son killed
Play with a match, fuck what you take it as
No good straight jacket, all I did break the match
They say he talk tough with his fake ass
Four pounds put me in another weight class
(Great Escape) the (Pad)
Took the jumpsuit off my naked ass and ate the mask
You diss me, you wanna be a great that fast?
Take a fully-automatic and spray at gas
Me? Body a whole shit with a verse probably atrocious
In your whole camp, nobody focused
They say you the 'Ultimate Warrior', I agree
You die and come BACK, won't nobody know it
Drive by, screamin' it's a new crew reppin'
Hangin out the window, like it's ""227""
Get 'em up high!

Get 'em up high, get 'em up high
Get 'em up high, get 'em up high
Get 'em up high, in the sky
Put 'em up high, put 'em up high
Put 'em up high, fingers in the sky
Put 'em up! Slaughterhouse, Slaughterhouse

Slaughterhouse,"Lord
Please continue to guide, direct, and protect my niggaz
From the world, and from themselves

[Chorus]
Lord can you please shine that light on your sons
They sent you a million prayers, you ain't answered near one
{""Ohh, it's a shame, baby baby""} It's a shame
I'm down on both knees, Father talk to 'em please
All you put 'em through is pain, but will it ever cease?
{""Ohh, it's a shame, baby baby""} What a shame

Yowwa! What up world? I'm Joell
Sixth floor, project door, broke bell
Only child, no brother, no sis
Moms runnin out the door to go sniff
My highwater pants don't fit
Afro growin all wild, no pic man
{""Ohh, it's a shame, baby baby""}
Is what my teacher said for class pics
My pops? I don't know where he at
He left one day, he said he'd be back
The stove keep me warm in the winter
I'm tired of Beefaroni for dinner
My grandmoms got a bad liver
I'm just watchin' her fade away
Man, I don't know what else to say
So at the end of every day I pray, I say

[Chorus]

What up world? I'm the shit
I'm headed to Hell in a hand-basket
I pop pills, abuse liquor and kill niggaz
When I die, God ain't gon' judge, he gon' deal with us
That's why them reckless quotes come with my drama
My pops while coke-infested, cum in my momma
{""Ohh, it's a shame, baby baby""}
I know, right?
For those nights that I was havin' them seizures
For those mornings that I was havin' trouble breathin'
C'mon listen; I was only a fo'-pound baby
So I grew up into grown and went fo'-pound crazy
Daddy was gangsta, mommy was passive
Boxin' gloves for Christmas, I needed classes
My daddy beat our ass, that's probably why we assassins
But he'll do anythang for me; Joey pray for me

[Chorus]

What up world? I'm a lost soul
Challengin' the devil standin' at the crossroads
I just shot a dirty snake with my .38
He shot me too, now I'm waitin' at the Pearly Gates
I seen the angel Gabriel and I came real
A lame tried to kill me, so I aim steel
{""Ohh, it's a shame, baby baby""}
Ask God is that somethin' that he can't feel
I had a six-shot popper and I brought it with me
I put his thinkin' cap somewhere he never thought it would be
I didn't son him, he's a daughter to me
Instead of hangin' with thugs he's slangin' drugs, shoulda got a college degree
But growin' up in the hood'll leave your mind baffled
We put haters in the past like time travel
That's my murder story, I'm past purgatory
I need prayer though, Joey put a word in for me

Tear drops in the pillow on my bed
Still trying to keep my head up
Know you'd rather see me dead
And the raindrops keep on falling
I said they keep on falling
And they keep on falling
I said they keep on falling

(Slaughterhouse yo)

I'm the product of when a nigga's mama gives up
Crying lying in the trash with the lid shut
Ain't got no family my mind is tender my
Daddy's invisible my Mom's is Brenda uh
If I survive I'm grow into what
Society considers trash the rope is to us
That means I'm hanging myself by living
The noose is getting murdered that or going to prison
My minds controlled before I learned mind control
What you call living life I call dying slow
I'm genetically predisposed
The reaper the only thing that can ease my soul freezing cold
Feeling like I was given life and if I take it at least I choose
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
Til then all I'm hearing is wind and rain drops

[Chorus]

(Cause this is my pain)
Dear auntie I still feel your timeless sorrow
Before you died it's like your body was mine to borrow
Like I jumped in your physical shell
While you was going through miserable hell saying goodbye to tomorrow
Everyday it make me sad, angry, mad how you were sent to heaven sacred path
Duct taped and gagged plus raped and stabbed body draped in blood what a faith to have
Such a pitiful end I'm popping Ritalin like they skittles cause
When I sleep I can feel it again and again and again it's difficult
Killing is the wickedest biblical sin I'm talking about momma's identical twin
I see your face when I look at her
Her reminder of how I've been in the cold
Since 14 years old
Swear to God I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
Til then all I'm hearing is wind and raindrops. (Rest in peace Chacha)

[Chorus]

Nah I ain't move bricks on the peter pan
No father around to teach me how to be a man
We was too high didn't know when we would land
Scraping coke on the weed til' niggas didn't see a plant
Alcoholic's child raise off of sugar water
Headed to you and just thought about how good he was brought up
Coulda woulda outta one track mind
They say man of many hats buys a hooker for a quarter
And now I'm writing a book and the hoods the author
Called the ""Obvious Poker Face The Look of Torture""
Teach you how to climb your way out that ditch then
Me all I need is this pen and thick skin
Being so bright could mean you lit then
Cause you start trying to figure out a figment
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
Til then all I hear is wind and rain drops

[Chorus]

(Check it out)
I'm still waiting on my did to get back
He went to the store in 84 and I ain't seen him after that
Another single mom public assisted the rent wasn't consistent
So they had us back and forth to court in the months of the blizzard (Freezing)
My sneakers leaned the rubber was missing
No one on ones they always jumped me no brothers and sisters to hold me down
Along with headphones plugged into a cheap Walkman that ate tapes
Gun shots and me sleep walking I hate weights
A whole lot of crying police chalking that fate tape
Ambulance never on time they like a day late
My cousin ain't had to vacate my best friend since age eight
Sometimes I can't hold them I kid you not
Eyes get swollen holding on that tissue box
Somebody get a mop
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
Til then all I'm hearing is wind and raindrops

Cause I deserve a Purple Heart

Typical Joe Budden shit, ridiculed and lovin' it
The hood know I'm the dude that governed it
Paved the way for my sons, laid down the cement for my semen
Ain't my fault y'all got stuck in it
Lately, it change like the weather, one minute they love me
Then they hate me; I'm through with shenanigans
I don't care if dudes ain't a fan of him
Can't checkmate a 8-figure nigga with the moves of a mannequin
Talkin' 'bout they wan' go somewhere to meet me
Man they just wan' go somewhere to meet me
Easy don't involve cops in it
Got the key to my city, how the FUCK you think you got locked in it?
Bitch!

twenty one Rugers
On the hip of twenty one goons, twenty one-gun salutin
Bloody funds is what murder money becomes
twenty one bodies on all twenty one guns
You from the D and you don't fuck with me, you lame
The streets and the internet fuck with me the same
So later for that punk shit
Cause nigga I'll smoke you, that's why they say I stay on that blunt shit
Niggaz'll spray you up before they wet your lady up
Then shoot the baby bassinet to shut your baby up
And I'm in line with the bread
I hold niggaz down doin time in the feds
Pharoahe talk to 'em

Properly greet a general
I'd have to take steps down to be on a pedestal
I am what the one-eight after the seven do
Give it my all but you want more, you lil' beggar you!
Mean it's terrible, I showed hip-hop anyone's edible
Never give somethin' that's not respectable
Never spit somethin that's not incredible
Never sold my soul for numbers left of the decimal
I done fucked up movements like cerebral palsy
You don't know me, don't pause me, I'll throw lead at you
Mean I earned e'ry stripe and you know it
When you see me put yo' hand on yo' head and push it forward

Before shots land on your head and push it forward
Eastside Long Beach, I'm only pushin' four words
I organize a street massacre
You haters know I broke bread with at least half of ya
Out of town, hundred pound weed trafficker
Got niggaz rockin' Long Beach fitteds in East Africa
I been stabbed, I been shot, a imperfect part
Like my Grape Street niggaz I got a Purple Heart
I kill your bitch at the beauty salon on Windham
They take a nap on your lawn on a Louis Vuitton pillow
Waitin' for you to run out and say somethin'
Come out your face frontin', dumb out and spray somethin'
Bloaw! So move now

Joe Budden is the pair of legs
He runs shit alongside I, the apparent head

Guess that's why I'm the torso
I pour sweat when I perform shows
What I record goes down as the best, but the vets won't let that torch go
Y'all could keep it, they got flashlights now
And flamethrowers, and I got one on my back right now
Remain focused, that's what I tell myself now and then
Don't want to go back to that block like when variation defends
Uh-oh, my stomach growls again, I ain't none of you cowards friends
Every human out of my sight before I count to ten
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
I'm hungry like I never ate
Set a table up with knives, forks and spoons, I'm 'bout to get a plate
All these sweet dummies looking me like a pepper steak
Means we never separate, we ain't married
Jab it every time I touch a pen, I sort of set a date
I'll devastate your career, look I'm a demonstrate
Let me get a good breath take before I regulate
(takes breath) okay, bye bye you guys, don't try to rhyme
Cause line for line
What I design is mine and mine
My joint's divine, meaning right behind
And thank god it shines all the light in mine

Buying too many size twenty skinny jeans

I'm pacquiao in the Philippines, illest thing niggas seen
You rappers dressing like you fittin to sing Billie Jean
I got to intervene, fuck you I'm a intervene
You loud talking, wouldn't kill a thing
Matter of fact, where's your head nigga? I got the guillotine
Fuck your Hollywood limousine and rented bling
I give you three red dots and I call it a triple beam
I'll put your pad on your property, fag
Properly rob you and hop in the jag
If you stopping the profit, the glock will be popping your body
You'll rock a colostomy bag
Shot in the abs, moms will be sad
Pops will be mad, doctor be glad
Possibly be stopping the plasma dropping
Clock running out and the outcome bad
Any one of you niggas fuck with my team
Pretty ass thing with the infrared beam
Sleep on that and get killed while you dream
Fuck a rap group slaughterhouse a machine
Slaughterhouse, a regime

My one goal's to astonish
Tell the President, VP, (you could) notify the congress
They say I'm arrogant, pompous, but I'm honest
I tell them keep an accomplice away from the accomplished
They still making threats on your highness
But I tell them where I be, they just ignore the compass
I think all your mans' play dough, I don't buy that movie, fandango
Fans they know that what you a soldier to a general
Baby steel, got it in a bag, airtight navy seal
Tell them little dudes I ain't mad at y'all
College kids like Asher Roth
Y'all just trying to put food on the table
While I'm a just come and try to snatch it off
If it ain't for me
Most young dudes would be angrily
But anxiously awaiting bankruptcy
Wonder what makes little motherfuckers think they the same as me
I'm synchronized you and your men should die
Learn certain shit you ain't meant to try
Got the ground covered with some niggas in disguise
Best bet is to attempt to fly
Shit's a game, you down, you in for life
Fuck y'all, I ain't got to generalize
Y'all enabled to write what the pen describes
So when he asked what I meant and why, I tell him

I fuck with nothing but gangstas

Or y'all falling off like the sag in my jeans

Relaxin' I'm clean, immaculate lean
Goin' my two steps, somethin' fat in between
Haters don't get mad at my dream
Opposites attract
I'm nice and the track is just mean

So I'ma fuck it up, flow ?

Them rumors you heard about me I refute those
The attribute of hoes
Don't affect my attitude at all
Die from what you told
Blood on your new clothes
'Cause even the biggest form a new bow

What they want, till glocks wit' em
Be in the box wit' em
Tryna box wit' em while they got the ox wit' em
Dot the eyes wit' em 
whole life's a rehearsal

Cars got the horse power of that old spice commercial
Silence when the vets speakin'
I'm jet skiing wit lesbians
You just seein', wanna just be him
In the casino, spendin' petti-cash
No worries I'm the same as what you met me as

Bitches sayin' go ahead wit' your sexy ass
Y'all can have my heart you can get it out this Plexiglas
Here's a message to the haters
I'll take money, power and fear, the respect'll come later

Slaughterhouse,"Joey, no rules, gun shots no prob
No jewels, niggas say I got robbed
I'm still wearin' my bling
And fuck first class, I fly standin' on Virgin America's wing
Nuts hang, knockin' down sky scrapers
Take a piss, make it rain, I'm the American dream
Make it rain I ain't Pacman Jones
Nigga, balls and my word, all a black man owns

If you in that man zone, how you figure to gain
Can't bowl a 300 in another niggas lane
Better aim, you dealin' with a 7 - 10 split

That's Long Beach cause we on some 710 shit

I been nice since 227 man shit
I am sick, and I'm never gettin' better that's it
Give me somethin' sharp to sever that prick
Like a group broke up I will dismember that click

I'm a veteran remember that shit
We some internet rappers
Then why you on our internet dicks
We'll be there when it's war callin'
Either we high or we fly or the floor fallin'
I'm a Tommy Gun, it ain't no best
The rap game like the St. Louis vs New York battle, nobody won
A bunch of fuckin' 2's, and 3's like zone defense

Please get at dude's Ortiz

Nah you beast 'em

Hold, stop, can't stop, thank pops
Hard headed, gotta hit a wall first like a bank shot
Get it clear, a coke head's a thin line between friend or foe
Won't let this shit disappear
This fiscal year, I'm a stay hot buzzin'
With dude's that help me shoot like A-rod cousin
Walk in my shoes and ya feet get callus
From Jersey City to Caesar's Palace
I speak with malice just to make sure the streets get salvaged
Real talk where would all of us be without it
Slaughterhouse no fear, too many dudes Tyson Chandler
Tried to leave their team and went nowhere

Like Tyson Chandler in the past niggas on some bullshit
Royce tell Preme I got a full clip
Niggas used to run when they saw Suge's face
Faster then Joey and Joell in a foot race
Now you ask me where the incident took place
Don't check the internet check hood space
You dealin' with some intelligent creatures
I don't touch guns I draw with telekinesis
No finger prints on Crooked's mag
I'm mixed with good and bad like the Goodfellas and Jesus
First Biggie and Jay made it
I'll leave a bandana at your murder and make it gang related
The bitch at the Shoney's told me homie

Ortiz I'm the one and only
Pick a spot, I pick apart you dudes who pick a part
This ain't a movie, I feel bad like lookin' at a pick of Pac
Niggas hearts gettin' sparked, every time I give an arc
To my wrist and it twists like a spliff when I'm sittin' in the park
Tall corny niggas ain't makin' a bigger mark
I boo drugs what I does got em runnin' to get a narc
You guppies unlucky you in a tank with a shark
Teeth crooked like my dog who just finished a vicious bark

Flick a dart through your top hat
Weak emcee's you cannot rap
Freak, where the drop at
Now ya mad at Tahiri cause ya ass ain't famous
Get it nigga, ya ass ain't famous
Quit talkin' about me cause ya ass ain't dangerous
They call me Hustler cause my mag game heinous
Show up to Detroit thinkin' everybody loves you
And I'm a come and show you that your ass ain't Raymond
Dumbin' every line, me fuckin' bitches is like the cops
After a murder they comin' everytime
Shell toes, and Wassan jacket, the contractor
Still pushin' elbows like a linebacker
And ya'll playin', my world wide bitches
On my world wide watch I call it the broad band

He said he tired of all the lyin', deceivin' and
Dickridin', the people providin' on every people when,

I do it, it's stupid, I bruise it like a bad pitch,
I lose it, my musics a movement and they just mad stiff,
I told 'em it's mathematical when this pad lift,
Point 'em out and I will subtract them, with an adlib,

See the fact is, I'm a bastard,
How can I not be macho man, I'm a savage,
In the past I was passive now I'm mad bitch,
I'm spazzin' you get them Adidas classic where your ass is,

Uh-uh, uh-uh, nickel ain't the one at all,
Snatch your vocal cords out and plug 'em in my wall,
You a knife in a gun fight, our shit is raw,
You're a square, you're silverware in a civil war,

The Slaughterhouse wolf pack riders is under the moon,
The reason you itchin' with your lighter under your spoon,

Pumped the ruger, moms called me con and loser,

Bet against it, probably can't recoup, out

Fuck a rapper, my clapper black as Muhammadiya,
Fuck you R&B bitches, shut up, you're not Aaliyah,

Smash on the gas, kick a bitch to the curb

Getting wild in the field with your spouse in brazil
On ounces and pills, how does it feel?
To count dollar bills that I found off skills
Check it out, jets fly private

I feel like I'm breathing
Light that spliff, now I don't even smoke cause it burn my throat but tonight I'm steaming
'Tron in my cup, holding mine up, toasting to the slut that I know I'm gon' fuck
In these five star sheets, put her right to sleep
Then kick the bitch out when I wake up
Even though baby girl got a large ol' ass
I remember praying that my car goes last
Now my car so fast that I don't think you'll understand it in a murcielago dash
When you ride through the dirt and you work til it hurt than you end up on marshall's staff
Hoping that your granny get to see you at the grammy's
Get a call from your family that your grandma passed
Then you know what you promised her
So that you stay hot as a, thermometer, dipped in lava
So proud to be part of a conglomerate, like this

My son didn't know who his pop was for years
Now it's less maury, god put it there as a test for me
Used to walk around with a vest at 40
Cops tryna mess hall me
Now babes with the 44f's adore me
I took the rock and a hard place and made the best orgy
Now the fans approach I get paranoid
Where I'm from tell me never let you're guard rest
But it's simple to disregard stress

First came on the scene, when Joell Ortiz first came on the scene
When Joe Budden first came on the scene, and one of the illest lyricist
In the game, when Royce Da 5'9 first came on the scene!

You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through you

Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight to the radio
If you trying to be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei die

I'm about that life so much I might go touch my rifles butt
And my dick just might go up
Nigga, that nostril on that rifle'll knock the snot right out you
Try me and I try out ya
The drum on the gun is Beta like Phi Alpha
But there ain't no frat niggas in the hood be calling me Tackleberry
And if he's iron, he will have him a easier time trying
To put on some pads and go in and try to tackle Barry
Then he go against this got damn G4 buying, Detroit lion
I'm about that life so much I might go golf
Trying to get me a hole-in-one to remind me of life when I go off
Homocidal thoughts, bodies outlined in chalk by the time it's dark
Dahmer signing his name on a dotted line with a bloody body part
I don't give a fuck if they wilding, I got a clip full of fucking Ray Allens
Selling that Sarah Palin, in broad day, a Letterman Fallon
When I shoot this iron, all you hear is hooping and hollin' like

My G, kill him and take his ID
I'm a renegade like E-M-I-N-E-M and Ja-Y-Z
Bitch it's karate, it's Mr. Miyagi mixed with Issey Miyake
Smell that chopper kicking when it's lifting ya body
Quick as Bugattis, then I'm hitting the Omni
With a chicken licking my dick in the lobby; this New Edition, I'm Bobby
Fast laner
I'm speaking the truth, put 3 in the coupe
I'ma wet your head like a leak in the roof
Then I'm leaving the booth for gas chamber
My granny calling me a rap singer
But she don't know I use my strap finger

Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to you
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through you
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight to the radio
If you trying to be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei die
Tonight

Look, this a whole nother ""Ether""
Hop out, black mask, low Caesar
Tell the goonies keep it low with the reefer
New bodies on old heaters
We ain't rapped too tight
Starving, they thought Jeffrey Dahmer had appetite
I'm detail, not derail
Don't lay your head if you shit by it
Got skeletons, but my shit private
I paved the way, y'all misguided
So try it, I'mma send a threat
Tie her up don't end her yet
Bullet go through your wife's eye now we know you ain't on the internet
In my head I see amateurs, can't retain a memory
All I'm left with is images
With that I'm putting emphasis
And in parentheses
Put he's hated by large percentages
And all my nemesis won't even let 'em on the premises
One shot, change him for life, he'll be belligerent
Even his text messages are gonna read like he's whispering
Bulletproofed the hoodie for Trayvon Martin
Then go to war with the cops, even they aren't pardoned

Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to you

You fuck with Jay-Z's bitch from back in the day
You might end up with reasonable doubt
You fuck with grimey bitches
Standing over you taking pictures
While you sleeping cause you passed out drunk after having a threesome
That will give you a reason, to trust no bitch
Quit rapping and just go get it cracking (in the kitchen)
Bout' to push that white instead of that music
Seems like simpler profit, cos nigga's gossiping like they world-stars

Can't tell y'all, if I did drugs or if they did me
Nah, we were just doing each other
We were side by side like everyday
Didn't care if we ruined each other
Back then it was so real, fully automatic it was overkill
I was on weed, I was on dust, might have tried coke when I was on pills
My pockets had rabbit ears, my mind gone, wasn't on bills
Whole family disappointed in me, can't imagine how that made my mom feel
Her one's missing, guns hidden, sorry Momma, your son's tripping
Got baggies scattered (in the kitchen)
Plus, you and Dad was' on the same road, y'all just left, made it right
If I didn't learn I'd do the same, pour some liquor, say goodnight
Now I'm on this music shit, trying to get this paper right
If not I'll be back (in the kitchen)

Let me get it now
On Twitter, they murder my mentions
Cause they heard I was served by a circle of henchmen
Laying in a dirty ditch that bullshit is further than fiction
Their personal mission's worse than snitching
To any person that listen, now I wanna' kill a hater
A middle finger by the 'fridgerator, flip a bird in the kitchen
Cuz DJ Vlad, he was glad, bullets went into me
Just to get traffic for his site, should've did him like MMG
But instead I called up Sway and we cleared that up on MTV
And now I'm back (in the kitchen) but should I be
Cause I heard that Slaughterhouse, is about to cop that Shady deal
But I'm out here chasing that paper still
Push Kush, Coke and crazy pills

No decent kicks cause mom kept enough of that snow to ski in her purse
No father, Jux passed me my first gun, revolver
With the serial carved up, Real showed me my first jump, I'm a barber
Shaving the crack, after weighing the crack
An then placing the crack in 12 12's
I ain't play with the crack, I was making up stacks
All day I just sat (in the kitchen), bringing it back
Now I'm tryna do my thing with this rap
Hope this works, trying to flip words so my homies
Ain't gotta flip birds On the curb

Presents, The Way It began
""Let's see now
First thing I can remember is an evening years back
The four of us was together even then
And from that time on, nothing was ever gonna be quite the same again
Yeah, especially us""

G-G-God given, I'm killin' this bomb bidniz
I'm calling rap that because I put my time in it
I-I don't mind being ready to die as long as this is at an arena
And we did it and my momma seen it
This is my arm swinging and my alarm ringing
Fighting against time but writing is on
Singing the light on my wall or just look how the mighty have fallen
You fell for it, say bye to them, say hi to Ryan mature
I can't (lose) 'cause God won't let me (lose)
Bet against me you can go (lose)
Anybody can tell you (nah) nah
I knew the cats knew I was down so I fell back
Hit the ground, landed on my feet vertical, fell back too, so you can (lose)
I will never lay down and (lose), I was definitely about to (lose)
Then Eminem came like (“nah”) “nah”
This shit is entertaining, listen to the shit they saying
Venom is spraying which is why all I know is
I'm on a all time ultimate high inspired by all time low

How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up

In these days life is short, shots'a try to end you
And this game is like a sport, comp'll try to pen you
I leave the stage on life support when I rock a venue
If you ain't got a knife and fork you're probably on the menu
If I ain't make history before I left
It will be like using my last important breath before my death for snorting meth
More or less, I'm, Jordan-esque, I ignore the refs
I son you like you morphed into a Orphan yes
Nah, I never (lose) yeah, you said I would (lose)
My destiny said (nah), homie you went against me
Foolish as Judas, nigga you're lost
Now I'm feeling like Black Jesus, wrong nigga to cross won't (lose)
If I refuse to (lose) the fact that I used to (lose) is making me say (“nah”)
This is how we attacking it, four rappers who passionate
Took the idea of a group and re-imagined it without planning it
Now the whole planet has to admit that's the shit

How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up

Anybody I'll invite into a crazy party
Have some fun, blocking the sun with the Shady Army
These women they feeling like skin, baby, they be on me
My flow water for sure, I'm a great tsunami
I'm with my awesome clique on another touring trip
From front of the stage all the way back to the door it's thick
Like secretly filming a mob, we recording hits
What a fucking lifestyle, maybe that's why I'm on my dick
(Lose) Man, I ain't about to (lose) I don't know how to (lose)
You beating the yaowa (nah) Mr. Ortiz I got you
Can't find a reason not to, my ink, take 'em to church
Guess you could call it pentecostal, man Eminem told me (lose) yourself
So how can I (lose) focus, you roaches
In combat so war? (nah), but if y'all need me to make it clear
For those slightly impaired
Like a flat in a snowstorm with no gas we ain't going nowhere
We the sixty minute group, this year finna be our year!

How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up
How quick are you gonna get up

A mixture of showman and skill, imposing my will
A visionary, want me with my back to the ground, I ain't with the missionary
Walk in my shoes and reap all of that gain
Along with every invisible woe that accompanies fame
Louis Vuitton frames cover the scars that go with stardom
Got enemies that I birthed these bars is for both pardon
So I taught me to steal plate, they threatening me from behind a condom
But you can't scream, fuck me! Then feel safe you just (lose)
Some people are praying I (lose), I thought I was set up to (lose)
Then Slaughterhouse came like (nah) nah
So I live by a real simple philosophy
If you stay grounded watch God keep giving you reasons not to be, can't (lose)
It's not in my plan to (lose), if I still happen to (lose)
Is that even possible (nah), keep that out of my reach
Still I'm praying the shit get manifested
Let the flow stage dive and hope for the fans to catch it
If you ever persevered you should understand the message

Slaughterhouse,"I remember it like it just happened
I could've sworn it was a dream
But in reality it hit me like a nightmare
Or at least that's how it seemed
I just got a grip on our relationship
We was ironing things out, started picking up steam
And when we didn't need it is when it all got heated
And we both said some things that we probably didn't mean
Then God intervened, guess more was at stake
Thought we left nothing over, He put more on the plate
She came home from the doctor with news I've been wanting
Says family was incoming, she's pregnant, twins coming
But that's gotta be a lie
She sighed, couldn't stop the tears coming from her eyes
That birth control she on, for them it's suicide
As long as it's still inside, two of them wouldn't survive
Hard turn from memorable to cynical
Picturing clothes for what would've been identical
Similar outfits, similar names
My deceased kids' ultrasound in a frame
So I'm deprived of my chance to be a better dad
Staring at my twins that I never had
I shed a tear, looking up in the sky
Even though y'all just got here, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife

My biological sperm donor, didn't wanna be a daddy
So he hopped in his Caddy and turned corners on us
Turned on us out the clear blue
His last memory of his son is seeing me through his rearview
I still love him yo, but I love his brother more
My uncle showed me love no one could know
Young and poor with a tougher road
To suffer hunger was nothing but Unc' would hold
Us down, help moms lift the motherload
I got grown and
I used to wonder what it would be like to speak to pops as a grown man
He provided that feeling, told me to take my career into my own hands
He was there when I had no fans
My cellphone rings, and after I answer
A voice says ""Your uncle's been diagnosed with cancer""
Worst news in my life
Him and chemo going 12 rounds with a disease and they both losing the fight
I'm rushing up to Cedars-Sinai
Praying for a miracle, I don't wanna see my idol die
Before he did, the look in his eyes
Said ""Even though you just got here, goodbye""

Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife

I'll see you again in the afterlife
Someday in heaven we will reunite
The flesh disappears but the soul survives
Till next time, my friend, farewell, goodbye

I walked in your daughter's house, knowing that you gone
But still looking out the corner of my eye, hoping you on the couch
That call felt like I was beef that had got shot up
Ironic, I was on tour with Tech N9ne and Slaughterhouse
D tried to talk to me, Crystal rubbed my back, as they was pouring out
I caught the next thing soaring out
Now I'm in the air, in the midwest somewhere
They said turbulence was severe, I don't know what they talking bout
I ain't feel a bump, body numb, mind drifting
I'm sniffling, asthma acting up, I'm whistling
I'm wishing my mother's face looked so much different
I'm kissing my son, my aunt pacing in the kitchen
My vision blurry, still I saw your face clear
What a loss, this time I did more than waste beer
Michelle's strong, she held on, we got all the way there
Then we walked in, she fell on the floor, this ain't fair
You was the voice when I considered them thoughts that ain't clear
Hey granny, I was fifth row at the Grammy's
An award they ain't hand me, but I sat behind Will
And right in front of Wayne, and got seen by the family
I miss the early morning convos, believe me
Regis on the TV, and the best baked ziti
But you had an all white affair, grandpa's all fly
Even though you been got there, goodbye

Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't

Please grant me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreaming, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm coming off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want

I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be
Mayhem, sickness, murder, horror
These are the kind of words that describe my aura
G Rap, Ras Kass, Kurupt
Redman I am cut from that cloth
Write a rhyme about me, you a dead man
Cool J, I'm Bad video
Learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
While they smoked and drank
Symphony, D.O.C. inspired me to write what
Would eventually put me on airplanes like B.o.B
Canibus, Wu-Tang, you know our history but hats off
When we rap this Jack Frost we outline the track chalk
Thank God for the one-two cadence
Thank God for the lunchroom tables
I'm trying to be the sickest nigga, dead or alive

Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

When I was a little boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snapping pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
It started off wack
But in the words of a ten year old, my shit was getting phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowing how the booth would feel, what's ADAT's and two inch reel
How you ad-lib? What's a punch? I ain't a boxer
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike you made a monster
Now everyday's a game of Contra, I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm telling you
Cause anyone can get dusted as long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggas sounding, damn
Weak head, ya'll suck bad, fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna to be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life, so wipe your feet before you step in

The same time being as real as can be

Yo, in my house, the lights out
No utilities in the facilities
Feeling my life's 'bout, to wipe out
These feelings I'm feeling be killing me
I pull the mic out, can't strike out
Cause if winning is really my enemy
I pull a nine out, blow my mind out
Is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die
Get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just passes by
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could clock checks
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is rough
I start feeling like shit's sour
The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers
For ten hours, so send cowards
The message from Crooked I
Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa

In our, house we spit like Sig Sauers
The way I feel now I could spit for six hours
Straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, 
If you can hear this sound inside my head sounds like a fucking drive-by
That's what the inside of my mind's like
Looking back on my career, even hindsight, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad well I got-ta go mad
Nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags
That bother me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does
Even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was
Someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you
Couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back
What you gonna go back, to working a regular job?
Fuck that, I'm gonna go hard grab on my, gonads
Tell them fuck themselves
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell
But I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, gangrene when I'm, angry then I'm
Hulk Smash, so much passion but no compassion
If eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassing
Alright now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stamping Yelawolf
Get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world it's like Clash Of The Titans
I released the cracker it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done
None shall ever fuck with this squadron
So come on in, at your own risk

My bank account, it don’t look bad
I got house gang, hood swag
I'm a Crook that'll Jump Off with five 9's or a good jab
Hell yeah, I could brag, dude ain't never switch
Whether the booth or on the strip I kept a Mac in my book bag
You mad little nigga cause I'm holding the belt
Do some ad-libs nigga, get over yourself
I’m here for the duration, you’re here to reputation

Though it took some time but we finally made it
Now can you truly say that you made it? Your Way

As a poster child for Photoshop my whole image was wrong
Straight out a movie, took a pill and all my limits were gone
Now you mention the best and you gotta argue, son
Clothes I used to borrow some now it's name brand drawls
Just so my dick can see how far I've come
Changing the topic to women they know me to keep mine in labels
That's how they drape judging of shapes I should keep mine in stables
They left him for dead, took him to watch me resurrect, that shit's pathetic
Shouldered the blame it's a shame it took hindsight to give me credit
I got kitchens in the masters, the fish tank is a wall
I got couches in the closets, my estate is confused
We say that blatantly for the fools that missed with a blessing that steal
There’s no other outcome when you question my will

Get over yourselves, fucker

We made it, we made it, we made it
But we did it our way, our way, our way
Though it took some time but we finally made it
Now can you truly say that you made it? Your Way

They say I’d never make it, never make it
My rhyme scheme is a crime scene, dog I yellow tape it
For lyrical murder, I’m on the verge of my next merger
Had to crawl before I walk so after I ex Gerber
I took it a step further
I took over the web servers
I took over the west word to these fresh words
And rode the wave of web surfers
A circus- that’s what this industry makes me think about
Cause selling out's a shortcut integrity's the scenic route
But you have never seen a crew or better team
While you forever sleep we’re doing everything you fuckers dream about
Sucker Slaughterhouse is what they scream and shout
Not the crowd, I mean your bitch now

So can you rescue me, from me

I was losing my mind like I was trying to lose it
Using my time for using, abusing my grind
This is my own honest view of who I am behind this, music
Ryan the whole bottle of patron Connoisseur
At a point in time I thought I blew it, doing crime
I would've washed a pill down with a shot of my own spinal fluid
And my momma knew it, she saw especially right through it
That I wasn't protected because peer pressure be like (do it)
But I couldn't fight through it, the beef started
The streets caught up, at least we didn't get involved in deceased orders
It's Slaughterhouse, cause Shady, me, Porter
Sat down and made peace over Porterhouse and Pies porter

Some stupid bitch done turned my girl against me
Should've tattooed the earth on my arm feel like the world's against me
Soon as I paraded, here come the rain falling the name calling
From the cuz I never met with his hand out like I'm straight balling
Feel like I knocked the 8 ball in
Every time I shoot a move I literally can't call it
Am I afraid of success? Let me think on it
I just got nervous, let me drink on it
Think I just answered yes but not on purpose

I pass the church and through the Son, Father, and Holy Spirit
But I'm only near it, man I need the pastor's service
I'm drowning cause I'm so tired of treading
So Lord when you get a second please

So can you rescue me
Because my ship is sinking
And I'm drowning at sea
So can you rescue me, from me
Can you rescue me?

I wake up and my shirt is leaking, covered in sweat
I'm dreaming of being murdered when I'm sleeping
Picture a person beefing, with himself
And it's even, worse when I'm drinking
It hurts when I'm thinking, me versus my personal demons
I'm reaching for my nine
If I point it at myself will it help to quiet the demons screaming in my mind?
And if I go, to the other side
Just tell my mother it was her prayers that kept her young'un thugging son alive
Plus my daughters and my butterfly, tell my son that I, love him
Tell my nieces and nephews their uncle tried
To take this music to the fucking peak
But I'm still a drug dealer as we fucking speak, that's fucking weak

Behind the tours and fanfare, hospitals and cat scans
Shoulder, when they call him bipolar, happiest mad man
Don't know my story, my struggle, the demons that I combat
Or how I'm starin' at them waiting for eye contact, beyond that
I got a soul mate that's naive, so the thought of me is prison to her
Baby momma that's crazy and a ten year old that listen's to her
My fam and friends think I'm the bank
And the way they keep coming back you think I'd got thanked
To you it's a dream, to me it's labor, these aren't monsters, these my neighbors
And we watch each others back, I guess its favor for a favor
Sometimes they even save me, when my wrist is to that razor

Its more than just a way of life
I've re-invented the way
I relate to this complacent world

Rapes my eyes
Screams never silence the pain
Death is like an old friend

I am you vice so real, so real
Desires of the scars of new flesh
Bathe in you blood excites/incites

The ritualistic lacerations
Inhumanities profane, insane
Inflicted since the dawn of time
Make your peace with God â?? goodbye

And embrace the pain that burns inside you
All of life decays
Rapes my eyes
Screams never silence the pain

Death is like an old friend
I can't wait to watch you die
I can't wait
Come step inside my hate you know there's nothing to it

Step inside my pain you'll never make it through it
Redefine your life in sado-paradise
Necessary cleansing of the mind's eye
Love and agony electric ecstasy

Can't get enough euphoric serenity
Stains won't fade away forever scarstruck
They never fade away forever scarstruck
Drown in my hate you know, you know

Hungry for the smell of Death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred

So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Holy water empty threat, the holy cross has no effect
I piss on any object of virtue, crucifix and rosaries
A world of insecurities, keep waiting for your soul to be rescued
You'll see no bright tomorrow, a promise of more sorrow

You call him the messiah, I see a reckless fashion based on metal slavery

You are the tainted, I am the pure, you are the sickness
I am the cure, a toxic threat of your non sense, I feed
I'll be the one to bring Christ to his knees, crucify then ridiculed again
A target for all time, until the end

Is our guilt erased by the pain that we've endured?

Hey look it's time to pledge allegiance
I love my dirty Uncle Sam
Our country's marching to the beat now
And we must learn to step in time

Where is the questioning? Where is the protest song?
Since when is skepticism un-American?
Dissent's not treason but they talk like it's the same
Those who disagree are afraid to show their face

Let's break out our old machines now
It sure is good to see them run again
Oh gentlemen start your engines
And we know where we got the oil from

Are you feeling alright now?
Paint myself all red, white and blue
Are you singing let's fight now?
Innocent People die, uh oh
There are reasons to unite
Is this why we unite?
If you hate this time
Remember we are the time!

Show you love your country, go out and spend some cash
Red, white, blue hot pants doing it for Uncle Sam
Flex our muscles show them we're stronger than the rest
Raise your hands up baby, are you sure that we're the best?

Once you get inside you'll never get out
We'll die together before the flames go out

Build it up just to tear it down
There's nothing left but ashes of doubt

Have the neighbors over and they'll sing along
Lowering the coffin on a love gone wrong

Where her only job was never to grow old

In the wind that blows

A promise fulfilled or not
Just hang on until the summer, it's hot)

And hope we're not washed away
By deceit or tragedy
And Joan of Arc rules northeast
Where the poor and the hipsters meet
The grid that divides us all
The river makes final call
Out at the edge of town
Where airfield runs water down
Coyote crosses old tracks
And hops on the Light-Rail Max

And if you wanna be a friend of mine
Cross the river to the east side
Find me on the eve of suicide
Tell me the city is no place to hide

She passed a club with music so loud
She wondered what it would be like
To stay out with a co-ed all night

Are making me feel queasy
Can't get my heart rate down

Two missionaries come with conversion kits
You'll be the one sewing cotton through their lips
We wear out the sun you'll be the one
Lying on the roof wearing factor 41

I'm not afraid of you you're very nice
In fact you've got it all you're very tall
I'm totally impressed can't get my heart rate down

I'm not afraid of you you're very nice
In fact you've got it all but I'm bored
Of being sycophantic
So get your knickers down",Factor 41
Sleeper,"Monday morning, fiction on the tube then sorting out the daily mail
Nasty habit, read the horoscope then pick the skin around her nails
Are shiny, made for making love or kissing indiscreetly 
At the weekend, miss the drink that leaves you feeling peaky

Tuesday lunchtime, itchy in a suit all dressed up for the pantomime
How d'you know though, when you're getting on or when you're getting back in
Line up, strung up, listen to the sound of someone else's funfair
Always racing, they'll catch you when you thought you'd just got somewhere

There's nothing you can do 
I'll make it up to you
You're feeling just like them
Tonight we'll find a different world or sign a different treaty
Love makes you forgetful so completely

You're always looking read about the lives that loiter in non fiction
While you're waiting someone stole the courage of your conviction",Feeling Peaky
Sleeper,"Rides his bike on a tarmac causeway
Makes him ten feet tall and drives him anywhere
Dreams of rockets and home-run heroes
Takes the brakes off on the big hills for a dare
Oh when its dark here
There's a voice that will always call you in
But you don't care
You still sleep without thinking
Best of luck Mr Gorsky all the world's waiting for you
There's a clock on the wall
And it ticks when you're small
Counting for you
Good luck Mr Gorsky all the worlds waiting for you
There's a plaque on the wall
That your wife won at school
Cleans it for you
Making holes in the tall white fences
And a hundred curtains flicker as you pass
Think that man must be ninety-seven
Built a telescope he focused on the stars
Models in boxes never look like the pictures on the front
But that's okay
They still fly on elastic",Good Luck Mr. Gorsky
Sleeper,"She's a movie star arrangement
Got a touch of Bergman to her face
She wears suits and buys him flowers
Smokes his cigarettes and bakes him cakes
He says uh oh I love you
But I'm not sure I trust you
You seem strange to me
She's got green eyes and she's lovely
Reminds me of the 'it' girl with her lips
Got an automatic license
Reads all Dostoyevsky's household tips
He says uh oh I love you
But I'm not sure I trust you
You seem strange to me
How come everyone suspects her
Attach her to a lie detector
Watch a thousand housewives fizz and burn
And every time she answers yes
The needles on his polygraph test
Just go round in circles like his brain
She's got long hair but she's ugly
Got a touch of Einstein to her brain
She wears fat clothes but she's cunning
People say she's easy all the same
He says uh oh I love you
But I'm not sure I trust you
You seem strange to me
It took a thousand cliches just to scold her
Took a man from Stepford and a tape recorder
Got his ego broken, so crestfallen
You made a start, you made us laugh
Stop it. You're a grown man baby
It's just that your head's no good",Lie Detector
Sleeper,"So I'll admit that it all started as a scam
'Cause every girl wanted you and a year round tan
We know you're old but you're kind
You're rich and your heart is dicky
Yes I knew that you wanted me
And he said

Hey love how are you fixed
We'll meet at ten past now it's quarter to six
We'll spend the whole night making love on the sofa
It may sound funny but he wasn't supposed to

And then we both settled down to our favourite meal
D'you fancy veal parmesan and a case of warm Chianti
Pass my bag I picked up that bra you fancied
Yes I knew that you wanted me

Oh we knew it couldn't last
And we should have left it long before
One great year and one for luck
And like all good things you soon wanted more
You were always so polite
I think I loved you

And I said

Hey love I'm making it easy on us
I'll leave and a few of our dreams turn to dust
All night making love on your sofa
And it may sound funny but he wasn't supposed to
Summer '92 I remember it clearly
When he choked on the olive in his dry martini
There was dismay from friends he was close to
And it may sound funny but it wasn't supposed to be",Nice Guy Eddie
Sleeper,"We step through London
The streets holding on to us
We'll stand where the river bends
I hope we fall in

So this time maybe
Lets take a photograph
We'll burn all the negatives
I hope we fall in

Its never gonna be this good so just climb in
How long till reason makes us small again?
And it feels just like we just got started

Its still you 
Taking me under
We turn to be scared
Then decide that we don't care
Wear ourselves out on the way down

Its still you 
And the moment you left me you said I was cheap 
You were the sale of the century
Grease ourselves up on the way down

And now I touch you
I don't know where you begin
Sometimes you're a piece of me
I hope we fall in

Its never gonna be this good so just climb in
How long till reason makes us small again
It feels just like we just got started

Its still you 
Taking me under
We turn to be scared
Then decide that we don't care
Wear ourselves out on the way down

Its still you
And the moment you left me you said I was cheap 
You were the sale of the century
Grease ourselves up on the way down

Its been too long, so it could just be something ate
It feels just like we just got started..

Its still you 
Taking me under
We turn to be scared
Then decide that we don't care
Wear ourselves out on the way down

Its still you
And the moment you left me you said I was cheap 
You were the sale of the century
Grease ourselves up on the way down",Sale of the Century
