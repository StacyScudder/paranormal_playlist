Ratt,"Bombs away
Down in the city
Somewhere
You're a cruel survivor
A little bit goes a long way
So they say

You always want what you can't have

Like love
I'm the one
Well don't you bite the hand that feeds you
If you want
What I got
Well don't you bite the hand that feeds you

Stealin' hearts
And all your cheap talk
Like Hell
I wouldn't put it past you
But sooner or later you'll pay
That's okay

You always want what you can't get

Like love
It ain't funny
Well don't you bite the hand that feeds you
You want money
I'll tell you honey
Well don't you bite the hand that feeds you

I'm a man with a strange appetite
And I'll be takin' you home tonight
If you can take the bed out of my head
But you can't take away the fun
So many times I still wonder why
You tried to keep me in line, yeah

You can take the bed out of my head
But you can't take away the fun

Cause that's love
I'm the one
Don't you bite the hand that feeds you
If you want, baby
What I've got
Well don't you bite the hand that feeds you

If you want (You want)
What I got (I got)
Well don't you bite the hand that feeds you
Like love (Like love)
I'm the one (I'm the one)
Well don't you bite the hand that feeds you

Bite me
Oh yeah

And I don't want to hear what's for sale
Just move on baby
Time has got you by the tail
Your tail

You don't know what you got till it's already gone
And now this gone as you can get
I try to reason with you but there's no reason at all

Dead ringer of a woman

You think I'm like a truck
Even I ain't gonna walk on glass
Well no chance
I try to love ya baby
But sometimes you're just a pain in the ass

The problem with you is that I can't get through
And all this proves is I can get
I take you up north and then you want to go south
You're just leaving another bad taste in my mouth

Not some little girl
Who had to grow up
In daddy's big world
I want a woman

Not the teacher's pet
Who tried to grow up
But hasn't made it quite yet
I want a woman
Who makes me feel like nobody can

New kid in town
Got fancy clothes
Old T-Bird car, baby

Steel guitars run across his back""

Check him out on his good side

Heard he came from Memphis
Somewhere down south
Started hangin' with the blues crowd
That's how he got that crazy sound
What is all this talkin' goin' round?

Out all night, keeps me up 'til dawn""

You know you can't have fire without the flame
Can't keep the fortune without the pain

You don't live it up or never live it down

Quicker than a heart attack
I've had to crawl, lie
I would've killed for a meal
I've had to beg, borrow, steal
I was beat, had to cheat 
Sold my ass on the street
But baby I'm back, on my feet

All or nothing, get outta my way
Give me what I want or get outta my face
I want it all or nothing, I want it today
Give me what I need or I'll blow you away

So if you see me on the street
You better look away
'Cause I'll spit right in your eye
And if you think I'm foolin' 
I got news for you
You'll be out there walkin' in dead man's shoes
I've been up, down
Kissin' the ground
I've had to climb my way to the top

I ain't ever goin' back to that fucked up scene

Like a knife through your heart tears you apart

O un amor que lo engañó
¡Vacío ya de amar why de llorar tanta traición!

Si yo tuviera el corazón, el mismo que di
Si yo supiera como ayer querer sin presentir
Es posible que a tus ojos que me gritan su cariño
Los cerrara con mis besos
Sin pensar que eran como esos otros ojos
Los perversos los que hundieron mi vivir

Si yo tuviera el corazón el mismo que perdí
Si olvidara a la que ayer
Lo destrozó why pudiera amarte
Me abrazaría a tu ilusión para llorar tu amor

See him Monday, but by Monday I'll be floating in the Hudson with

Just the simple stuff. 
Keep a tender distance 
So we'll both be free. 
That's the way it ought to be. 
I'm ready! 

Marry me a little, 
Body, heart, and soul. 
Passionate as hell 
But always in control. 
Want me first and foremost, 
Keep me company. 
That's the way it ought to be. 
I'm ready! 
I'm ready now! 

Oh, how gently we'll talk, 
Oh, how softly we'll tread. 
All the stings, 
The ugly things 
We'll keep unsaid. 
We'll build a cocoon 
Of love and respect. 
You promise whatever you like, 
I'll never collect. 
Right? 
Okay, then. 
I'm ready. 
I'm ready now. 
Someone-- 

I'm ready!

Raúl Garello,"Cuando la suerte que es grela
Fayando y fayando
Te largue parao
Cuando estés bien en la vía
Sin rumbo, desesperao

Cuando no tengas ni fe
Ni yerba de ayer
Secándose al sol

Cuando rajes los tamangos
Buscando ese mango
Que te haga morfar

La indiferencia del mundo
Que es sordo y es mudo
Recién sentirás

Verás que todo es mentira
Verás que nada es amor
Que al mundo nada le importa
Yira, yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda
Ni una mano, ni un favor

Cuando estén secas las pilas
De todos los timbres que vos apretás
Buscando un pecho fraterno
Para morir abrazao

Cuando te dejen tirao
Después de cinchar
Lo mismo que a mí

Cuando manyés que a tu lado
Se prueban la ropa
Que vas a dejar

Te acordarás de este otario
Que un día, cansado
Se puso a ladrar

Verás que todo es mentira
Verás que nada es amor
Que al mundo nada le importa
Yira, yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda
Ni una mano, ni un favor

Aunque te quiebres la vida
Yira, yira
Ya verás que en la vida todo es mentira
No sufras siempre vente yira yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Yira, yira
Te criticaran, te adularan y te enviaran
No hagas caso lo que digan

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Yira, yira
De arriba abajo te miran
Hay que gente engreída y atrevida

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Yira, yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda
Ni una mano, ni un favor

Raul Jaurena,"Lastima bandoneón, mi corazón
Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva
Ya sé, no me digas tenes razón

Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris

Raul Malo,"We've been meeting this way for a while
Always keeping our hearts in denial
But the rules of the game are as such
There are some things you never should rush
With the way that you're looking tonight
It was only a matter of time
Before I got so overwhelmed
And I just could not help myself

I said I love you I didn't mean to
But the moonlight just gave me away
Now that I said it try to forget it
And pretend it was all a mistake
I'll keep trying though I'm denying
This feeling that I know is true
Stumbling and falling and still after all I keep falling in love with you

What's the point of this masquerade
After all of our cards have been played
Now there's nothing for me left to hide
I hope I have fate on my side
Either way I've got nothing to lose
Surrender is all I can do
And if you should be mine in the end
I'll remember it all happened when

I said I love you I didn't mean to
But the moonlight just gave me away
Now that I said it try to forget it
And pretend it was all a mistake
I'll keep trying though I'm denying

Was I with you right there in the room
Did it happen overnight or a little at a time?
Was it something I did or didn't do?
And now
You're staring back at me
Still you never see that

I see you
Never see me
Never hear and never believe me
And every night I see you losing me

Why does love get so complicated?
Why do feelings have to change?
Can't they last forever
Do they fade away with time
Or does it always have to end this way
Tell me why
If love is really blind
When I close my eyes do

I see you
Never see me
Never hear and never believe me
And every night I see you losing me

Yeah, I see you

Raul Malo,"Do you fear this man's invention that they call atomic power?
Are we all in great confusion, do we know the time or hour
When a terrible explosion may ring down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction blotting out the works of man

[Chorus]
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your Savior in the end?
Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?

There is one way to escape and be prepared to meet the Lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus, He will be your shield and sword
He will surely stand beside and you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety and eternal peace and rest

[Chorus]

There's an army who can conquer all the enemy's great bands
It's a regiment of Christians guided by the Savior's hand
When the mushroom of destruction falls and all it's fury great
God will surely save His children from this awful, awful fate

Then I would not have found you 
Angel flying too close to the ground 
I patched up your broken wing and hung around for a while 
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down 
I knew someday that you would fly away 

For love's the greatest healer to be found 
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember 
Angel flying too close to the ground 

Fly on fly on past, the speed of sound 
I'd rather see you up than see you down

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

The rest of my life.

It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter it's a marsh, in winter it's a marsh
In winter it's a marshmallow world

Raul Malo,"If I should live in the past would you think less of me
There's a chance those memories will last for an eternity
I just keep waiting, perhaps even hating to find you gone
How could something so right turn out so wrong?

I still remember the nights in the warm summer breeze
And the words of love we confessed that came out with ease
There was nary a lie, there were tears barely cried, maybe one or two
Now I spend all my time crying for you

This crying for you never ends if tomorrow it happens again
It's not that I'm helpless, I just can't help crying for you
It's sad that we've falling apart, tears pouring down in the dark
I know it's all over but I just keep crying for you

I just keep waiting perhaps even hating to find you gone
How could something so right turn out so wrong?

I know it's all over but I just keep crying for you",Crying for You
Raul Malo,"Well, well, hello again, tell me where you've been
It's been a while oh honey, my old friend
You've been there for me, faithful as you can be
You're the one I count on in the end

I wish it weren't so but that's how it seems to go
One night you're making memories then that's all you are

Raul Malo,"All in the love is fair, the same way everywhere
It simply has no rules
I never took the time or paid it any mind
It didn't matter who win or lose

Ever since I met you things have changed
Cloudy skies have brighter days
Even fate has turned my way
I know that I would be a fool not to bet it all on you
And let the chips fall where they may

And now I'm the lucky one, I'll always be the lucky one
As long as you are close to me
Like a gambling man who always holds a winning hand
Losing's just a thought I can't conceive

The worlds a better place, one look at you is all it takes
And I surrender willingly
And now I'm the lucky one, I'll always be the lucky one
Since I have you close to me

Lovers take their vows, many times I've wondered how
Say those words so easily
Did that happiness hide their loneliness
With the things I couldn't see

I may never understand what would make a man
Think he found the one he needs
But I don't question why, I just believe
That I found a love that's meant to be

Now I'm the lucky one, I'll always be the lucky one
As long as you are close to me

Raul Seixas,"'Tá rebocado meu compadre
Como os donos do mundo piraram
Eles já são carrascos e vítimas
Do próprio mecanismo que criaram

O monstro SIST é retado
E tá doido pra transar comigo
E sempre que você dorme de touca
Ele fatura em cima do inimigo

A arapuca está armada
E não adianta de fora protestar
Quando se quer entrar
Num buraco de rato
De rato você tem que transar

Buliram muito com o planeta
E o planeta como um cachorro eu vejo
Se ele já não aguenta mais as pulgas
Se livra delas num sacolejo

Hoje a gente já nem sabe
De que lado estão certos cabeludos
Tipo estereotipado
Se é da direita ou dá traseira
Não se sabe mais lá de que lado

Eu que sou vivo pra cachorro
No que eu estou longe eu 'to perto
Se eu não estiver com Deus, meu filho
Eu estou sempre aqui com o olho aberto

A civilização se tornou complicada
Que ficou tão frágil como um computador
Que se uma criança descobrir
O calcanhar de Aquiles
Com um só palito pára o motor

Tem gente que passa a vida inteira
Travando a inútil luta com os galhos
Sem saber que é lá no tronco
Que está o coringa do baralho

Quando eu compus fiz Ouro de Tolo
Uns imbecis me chamaram de profeta do apocalipse
Mas eles só vão entender o que eu falei
No esperado dia do eclipse

A única linha que eu conheça
É a linha de empinar uma bandeira

Eu já passei por todas as religiões
Filosofias, políticas e lutas
Aos onze anos de idade eu já desconfiava
Da verdade absoluta

Raul Seixas e Raulzito
Sempre foram o mesmo homem
Mas pra aprender o jogo dos ratos

Raul Seixas,"Eu nunca cometo pequenos erros
Enquanto eu posso causar terremoto
E das tempestades já não tenho medo
Acordo mais cedo

Eu nunca me animo de ir ao trabalho
Eu sou o coringa de todo baralho
Sou carta marcada em jogo roubado
A morte ao meu lado

Eu sou o moleque maravilhoso
Num certo sentido o mais perigoso
Moleque da rua, moleque do mundo, moleque do espaço

Quebrando vidraças do velho Ricardo
Nesta vizinhança sou filho bastardo
Com o meu bodoque sempre no pescoço
Eu exijo meu, eu exijo meu, eu exijo meu osso

Raul Seixas,"Assim como
Todas as portas são diferentes
Aparentemente
Todos os caminhos são diferentes
Mas vão dar todos no mesmo lugar
Sim
O caminho do fogo é a água
Assim como
O caminho do barco é o porto
O caminho do sangue é o chicote
Assim como
O caminho de reto é o torto
O caminho do risco é o sucesso
Assim como
O caminho do acaso é a sorte
O caminho da dor é o amigo
O caminho da vida é a morte",Caminho II
Raul Seixas,"Você me pergunta
Aonde eu quero chegar
Se há tantos caminhos na vida
E pouca esperança no ar
E até a gaivota que voa
Já tem seu caminho no ar
O caminho do fogo é a água
O caminho do barco é o porto
O do sangue é o chicote
O caminho do reto é o torto
O caminho do bruxo é a nuvem
O da nuvem é o espaço
O da luz é o túnel
O caminho da fera é o laço
O caminho da mão é o punhal
O do santo é o deserto
O do carro é o sinal
O do errado é o certo
O caminho do verde é o cinzento
O do amor é o destino
O do cesto é o cento
O caminho do velho é o menino
O da água é a sede
O caminho do frio é o inverno
O do peixe é a rede
O do pio é o inferno
O caminho do risco é o sucesso
O do acaso é a sorte
O da dor é o amigo
O caminho da vida é a morte!

Raul Seixas,"Entra pelas portas do fundo
Do Oceano Atlântico um cara
De baleia, terno e gravata
Seu nome é Peixuxa
É amigo dos peixes
É gente e respira debaixo do mar
Mar, mar, mar
Ma, ma, ma, ma, mas sempre com um charuto na boca
Vai andando debaixo d'água
Vai até o mediterrâneo
Pois tem um encontro com hora marcada
Com a lua cheia para um lindo jantar
Tem gente estranha por debaixo do mundo
Tal qual Peixuxa, baixo, gordo, salgado
Tem gente estranha trabalhando nos fundo
Que não é peixe mas não morre afogado
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Ele é cordial com os peixes
Dá bom-dia quando é de dia
Boa-noite quando é de noite
E se não é de dia e se não é noite
Peixuxa, amavelmente, da maresia
Seu Peixuxa antigamente
Foi chamado de Deus dos mares
'Inda guarda em casa um tridente
E quando eu olho
O mar com petróleo
Eu rezo a Peixuxa que ele fisgue essa gente",Peixuxa (O Amiguinho Dos Peixes)
Raul Seixas,"You were born at the ending
As the curtain came down
I can see you're confused girl but it's all right
It's only the chimes
Announcing a new time

You see now
Boats are cruising the deserts
Oceans cracked by the heat
People drowning in raindrops
But it's all right
It's not a defeat
Stand on your own feet

Right now the sun doesn't shine
He's loaded on wine
Though I can laugh in the storm
Because I was born

When the sun used to
Shine in June",Sunseed
Raul Seixas,"Tudo quanto é velho eles botam pr'eu ouvir
E tanta coisa nova jogam fora sem curtir
Eu não nego que a poesia dos cinquenta é bonita
Mas todo o sentimento dos setenta onde é que fica?

Eu vou fazer o que eu gosto
Eu vou
Dos cinquenta bonita-ta
Mas os setenta onde é que ele está?
Por isso a nostalgia eu tô curtindo sem querer
Porque está faltando alguma coisa acontecer
Mamãe já ouve Beatles
Papai já deslumbrou
Com meu cabelo grande
Eu fiquei contra o que eu já sou

Eu vou fazer o que eu gosto
É mãe com os Beatles e o pai falô
Logo então eu fiquei contra o que eu já sou
O rock hoje em dia já mudou, virou outra coisa
É por isso que eu corto o cabelo

Na curva do futuro muito carro capotou
Talvez por causa disso é que a estrada ali parou
Porém, atrás da curva
Perigosa eu sei que existe
Alguma coisa nova
Mais vibrante e menos triste

Eu vou fazer o que eu gosto
Atrás da curva do perigo existe
Alguma coisa bem mais nova e menos triste",A Verdade Sobre a Nostalgia
Raul Seixas,"No lixo dos quintais
Na mesa do café
No amor dos carnavais
Na mão, no pé, oh
Tu estás, tu estás
No tapa e no perdão
No ódio e na oração

Teu nome é Yemanjah (Yemanjah)
E é Virgem Maria
É Glória e é Cecília
Na noite fria
Oh, minha mãe
Minha filha tu és qualquer mulher
Mulher em qualquer dia

Bastou o teu olhar (Teu olhar)
Pra me calar a voz
De onde está você
Rogai por nós
Ooh, ooh!
Minha mãe, minha mãe
Me ensina a segurar
A barra de te amar

Não estou cantando só
Cantamos todos nós
Mas cada um nasceu
Com a sua voz,
Ooooh, Ooooh!
Pra dizer, pra falar
De forma diferente
O que todo mundo sente

Segure a minha mão
Quando ela fraquejar
E não deixe a solidão
Me assustar
Ooooh, Ooooh!

Minha mãe, nossa mãe
E mata minha fome
Nas letras do teu nome
Ooooh, Ooooh!

E mata minha fome

Raul Seixas,"Nada tão belo como uma criança dormindo
Nem tão profundo como dormir sem sonhar
Nem tão antigo como o sonho dos teus olhos
Nem tão distante como a hora de acordar

Dorme enquanto teu pai faz músicas
Que é a forma dele rezar
Todos os sonhos na realidade
São verdades, se eu puder cantar

Você chora quando tem fome
Mas vem logo uma mamadeira
Amanhã se você chorar
Vai chorar tua vida inteira

Fiz meu rumo por essa terra
Entre o fogo que o amor consome
Eu lutei mas perdi a guerra
Eu só posso te dar meu nome",Cantiga de Ninar
Raul Seixas,"Eu sei que determinada rua que eu já passei
Não tornará a ouvir o som dos meus passos
Tem uma revista que eu guardo há muitos anos
E que nunca mais eu vou abrir.
Cada vez que eu me despeço de uma pessoa
Pode ser que essa pessoa esteja me vendo pela última vez
A morte, surda, caminha ao meu lado
E eu não sei em que esquina ela vai me beijar

Com que rosto ela virá?
Será que ela vai deixar eu acabar o que eu tenho que fazer?
Ou será que ela vai me pegar no meio do copo de uísque?
Na música que eu deixei para compor amanhã?
Será que ela vai esperar eu apagar o cigarro no cinzeiro?
Virá antes de eu encontrar a mulher, a mulher que me foi destinada,
E que está em algum lugar me esperando
Embora eu ainda não a conheça?

Vou te encontrar vestida de cetim
Pois em qualquer lugar esperas só por mim
E no teu beijo provar o gosto estranho
Que eu quero e não desejo, mas tenho que encontrar
Vem, mas demore a chegar
Eu te detesto e amo morte, morte, morte
Que talvez seja o segredo desta vida
Morte, morte, morte que talvez seja o segredo desta vida

Qual será a forma da minha morte?
Uma das tantas coisas que eu não escolhi na vida
Existem tantas
Um acidente de carro
O coração que se recusa abater no próximo minuto
A anestesia mal aplicada
A vida mal vivida, a ferida mal curada, a dor já envelhecida
O câncer já espalhado e ainda escondido, ou até, quem sabe
Um escorregão idiota, num dia de sol, a cabeça no meio-fio

Oh morte, tu que és tão forte
Que matas o gato, o rato e o homem
Vista-se com a tua mais bela roupa quando vieres me buscar
Que meu corpo seja cremado e que minhas cinzas alimentem a erva
E que a erva alimente outro homem como eu
Porque eu continuarei neste homem
Nos meus filhos, na palavra rude
Que eu disse para alguém que não gostava
E até no uísque que eu não terminei de beber aquela noite

Vou te encontrar vestida de cetim,
Pois em qualquer lugar esperas só por mim
E no teu beijo provar o gosto estranho que eu quero e não desejo
Mas tenho que encontrar
Vem, mas demore a chegar
Eu te detesto e amo morte, morte, morte
Que talvez seja o segredo desta vida
Morte, morte, morte que talvez seja o segredo desta vida",Canto Para Minha Morte
Raul Seixas,"Hoje é o dia da saudade
Hoje é feriado
É o dia da saudade

Hoje eu vou beber para celebrar
O aniversário do seu Gaspar
Deve ter festa em algum lugar

Hoje não tem aula pra garotada
Velhas de varizes na calçada

Raul Seixas,"O que que você quer ser quando você crescer?
Aguma coisa importante
Um cara muito brilhante
Quando você crescer
Não adianta, perguntas não valem nada
É sempre a mesma jogada
Um emprego e uma namorada
Quando você crescer
E cada vez é mais difícil de vencer
Pra quem nasceu pra perder
Pra quem não é importante
É bem melhor
Sonhar, do que conseguir
Ficar em vez de partir
Melhor uma esposa ao invés de uma amante
Uma casinha, um carro à prestação
Saber de cor a lição, que no
Que no bar não se cospe no chão, nego
Quando você crescer
Alguns amigos da mesma repartição
Durante o fim-de-semana
Se vai mais tarde pra cama
Quando você crescer
E no subúrbio, com flores na sua janela
Você sorri para ela
E dando um beijo lhe diz
Felicidade
É uma casa pequenina
E amar uma menina
E não ligar pro que se diz
Belo casal que paga as contas direito
Bem comportado no leito
Mesmo que doa no peito
Sim
Quando você crescer
E o futebol te faz pensar que no jogo
Você é muito importante
Pois o gol é o seu grande instante
Quando você crescer
Um cafézinho mostrando o filho pra vó
Sentindo o apoio dos pais
Achando que não está, só
Quando você crescer
Quando você crescer
Quando você crescer",Quando Boce Crescer

Raul Seixas,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

E eu sem saber se devia ou não tocar
Se era estrangeira, mãe, esposa ou outra besteira
Que eu inventei de aprontar

O hoje é apenas um furo no futuro
Por onde o passado começa a jorrar
E eu aqui isolado onde nada é perdoado
Vi o fim chamando o princípio pra poderem se encontrar

Fui levado na marra, pois enfermeiro quando agarra
É que nem ordem de prisão
A ambulância me esperava, e aí o que rolava, internamento e injeção

E lá em Serra Pelada, ouro no meio do nada
Dor de barriga desgraçada resolveu me atacar
O show estava começando e eu no escuro me apertando
E autografando sem parar

Muitas mulheres eu amei e com tantas me casei

Nem todo bem que conquistei, nem todo mal que eu causei

Raul Seixas,"Quando eu morri em Dezembro
De mil novecentos e setenta e dois
Esperava ressuscitar e juntar os pedaços

Da minha cabeça
Um tempo depois um psiquiatra disse
Que eu forçasse a barra
E me esforçasse pra voltar à vida
E eu parei de tomar ácido lisérgico
E fiquei quieto lambendo minha própria ferida
Sem saber se era crime ou castigo

E se havia outro cordão no meu umbigo
Pra de novo arrebentar
Pois eu fui puxado à ferro
Arrancado do útero materno
E apanhei pra poder chorar
Quando eu morri suando frio
Vi Jimi Hendrix tocando nuvens distorcidas
Eu nem consegui falar
E depois por um momento
O céu virou fragmento do inferno
Em que eu tive que entrar
Eu sentia tanto medo, só queria dormir cedo

Pra noite passar depressa
E não poder me agarrar
Noites de garras de aço
Me cortavam em mil pedaços
E no outro dia eu tinha que me remendar
E se a vida pede a morte
Talvez seja muita sorte eu ainda estar aqui
E a cada beijo do desejo
Eu me entorpeço e me esqueço
De tudo que eu ainda não entendi",Qundo Eu Morri

Raul Seixas,"It brings me sadness just remembering getting home
From a tiring day of work, she would hold me very tight
And kiss me tenderly
We sat while, and she'd tell me all the news
How she took the kids to school and she found them at the zoo
Throwing peanuts to the bears

Oh, this remembrance keeps reflecting on my mind:
When the days ran calm and fine
And I had her by my side
Swearing love eternally

But, hey! How could I know
Love was to go after all this time?
Hey! How could I see
She would leave me after all this time?

Little by little our sky was getting darker
Our dreams were running farther
Our smiles becoming harder, in the distance of us two
Our loving glaces very rarely they were meeting
We were always, always fleeing
From a love we felt was ending, still we never said a word

But, hey! How could I know
Love was to go after all this time?
Hey! How could I see
She would leave me after this time?

Then one fine morning with a torn and acking heart
We decided we should part, for it was late ro restart
A love that never was
I still can picture you were standing at the railing
Saw your taxi that was waiting
Held a tear when you were waving your very last good-bye
The kids were with me as your taxi drove away
I had nothing more to say
So I put them all to sleep",How Could I Know?

Ficar entre nós dois

Irá gostar de todas
Porque todas são iguais

Como podes ficar presa
Que nem santa num altar

Que é a beleza de deitar",A Maçã
Raul Seixas,"É pena
Que você pensa que eu sou escravo
Dizendo que eu sou seu marido
E não posso partir
Como as pedras imóveis na praia
Eu fico ao teu lado, sem saber
Dos amores que a vida me trouxe
E eu não pude viver

Eu perdi o meu medo
Meu medo, meu medo da chuva
Pois a chuva voltando pra terra
Traz coisas do ar
Aprendi o segredo
O segredo, o segredo da vida
Vendo as pedras que choram sozinhas
No mesmo lugar

Eu não posso entender
Tanta gente aceitando a mentira
De que os sonhos desfazem
Aquilo que o padre falou
Porque quando eu jurei
Meu amor eu traí a mim mesmo
Hoje eu sei que ninguém neste mundo
É feliz tendo amado uma vez
Uma vez

Eu perdi o meu medo
Meu medo, meu medo da chuva
Pois a chuva voltando pra terra
Traz coisas do ar
Aprendi o segredo
O segredo, o segredo da vida

Vendo as pedras que choram sozinhas
No mesmo lugar
Vendo as pedras que sonham
Sozinhas no mesmo lugar",Medo da Chuva

Ainda hoje me comove
Me causando imensa dor, dor!

Eu me lembro
Do dia em que você entrou num bode
Quebrou minha vitrola e minha coleção
De Pink Floyd

Eu sei que eu não vou ficar aqui sozinho
Pois eu sei que existe um careta
Um careta em meu caminho, ah

Nada me interessa nesse instante
Nem o Flávio Cavalcanti
Que ao teu lado eu curtia na TV, na TV

Nessa sala hoje eu peço arrego
Não tenho paz, nem tenho sossego
Hoje eu vivo somente a sofrer! A sofrer!

E até! Até o filme que eu vejo em cartaz
Conta nossa história e por isso
E por isso eu sofro muito mais

Eu sei que dia a dia aumenta o meu desejo
E não tem Pepsi-Cola que sacie
A delícia dos teus beijos, ah

Quando eu me declarava você ria
E no auge da minha agonia
Eu citava Shakespeare

Não posso sentir cheiro de lasanha
Me lembro logo das casas da banha
Onde íamos nos divertir, divertir!

Mas hoje o meu Samsui Garrard Gradiente
Só toca mesmo embalo quente
Pra lembrar do teu calor
Então eu vou ter com a moçada lá do Pier
Mas pra eles é careta se alguém
Se alguém fala de amor, ah!

Na Faculdade de Agronomia
Numa aula de energia
Bem em frente ao professor
Eu tive um chilique desgraçado
Eu vi você surgindo ao meu lado
No caderno do colega Nestor, Nestor!

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for

Numa cama que eu não gosto só porque você mandou

Não tenho pressa, tenho muita paciência
Na esquina da falência

Olha o meu charme, minha túnica, meu terno
Eu sou o anjo do inferno que chegou pra lhe buscar
Eu vim de longe, vim d´uma metamorfose
Numa nuvem de poeira que pintou pra lhe pegar

Mas se assusta com o que eu faço, isso eu já posso ver
E foi com isso justamente que eu vi
Maravilhoso, eu aprendi que eu sou mais forte que você

Kitnet de um quarto que eu comprei a prestação
Pela caixa federal, au, au, au
Eu não sou cachorro não (não, não, não)!
Eu liquidei a prestação do paletó, do meu sapato, da camisa
Que eu comprei pra domingar com o meu amor
Lá no cristo redentor, ela gostou (oh!) e mergulhou (oh!)
E o fim de mês vem outra vez!

Eu procurei fumar cigarro Hollywood
Que a televisão me diz que é o cigarro do sucesso

Tô terminando a prestação do meu buraco, do
Meu lugar no cemitério pra não me preocupar
De não mais ter onde morrer
Ainda bem que no mês que vem
Posso morrer, já tenho o meu tumbão, o meu tumbão!

Eu consultei e acreditei no velho papo do tal psiquiatra
Que te ensina como é que você vive alegremente
Acomodado e conformado de pagar tudo calado
Ser bancário ou empregado sem jamais se aborrecer
Ele só quer, só pensa em adaptar
Na profissão seu dever é adaptar
Ele só quer, só pensa em adaptar

Do açougue fedorento que me vende carne podre
Que eu tenho que comer
Que engolir sem vomitar

Encobre asfaltos que guardavam

Você pune quem não é você?

Vou poder contar meus filhos, caminhar nos trilhos, isso é pra valer

Outra então tem que se apagar
Quero estar vivo para ver
O sol nascer, o sol nascer, o sol nascer

Pelo elevador dos fundos, que carrega o mundo sem sequer sentir

ÓI, é o trem, não precisa passagem nem mesmo bagagem no trem

Quem vai ficar, quem vai partir?
Pois o trem está chegando, tá chegando na estação
É o trem das sete horas, é o último do sertão, do sertão

ÓI, olhe o céu, já não é o mesmo céu que você conheceu, não é mais
Vê, ói que céu, é um céu carregado e rajado, suspenso no ar

Vê, é o sinal, é o sinal das trombetas, dos anjos e dos guardiões
ÓI, lá vem Deus, deslizando no céu entre brumas de mil megatons

ÓI, olhe o mal, vem de braços e abraços com o bem num romance astral

Raul Seixas,"Meus amigos essa noite eu tive uma alucinação
Sonhei com um bando de número invadindo o meu sertão
E de tanta coincidência que eu fiz essa canção

Falar do número um
Falar do número um não é preciso muito estudo
Só se casa uma vez e foi um Deus que criou tudo
Uma vida só se vive, só se usa um sobretudo

Agora o doze
E só de pensar no doze eu então quase desisto
São doze meses do ano, doze apóstolos de Cristo
Doze hora é meio-dia, haja dito e haja visto

Agora o sete
Sete dias da semana, sete notas musicais
Sete cores do arco-íris nas regiões divinais
E se pintar tanto sete, eu já não agüento mais

Dois
E no dois o homem luta entre coisas diferente,
Bem e mal, amor e guerra, preto e branco, bicho e gente
Rico e pobre, claro e escuro, noite e dia, corpo e mente

Agora o quatro
E o quatro é importante, quatro ponto cardeal
Quatro estação do ano, quatro pé tem um animal
Quatro perna tem a mesa, quatro dia o carnaval

Pra encerrar
Eu falei de tanto número, talvez esqueci algum
Mas as coisas que eu disse não são lá muito comum
Quem souber que conte outra, ou que fique sem nenhum",Os Números
Raul Seixas,"Quando esqueço a hora de dormir
E de repente chega o amanhecer
Sinto a culpa que eu não sei de que
Pergunto o que que eu fiz?

Eu sinto medo!
Eu sinto medo!

Se eu vejo um papel qualquer no chão
Tremo, corro e apanho pra esconder
Com medo de ter sido uma anotação que eu fiz
Que não se possa ler
E eu gosto de escrever, mas
Mas eu sinto medo!
Eu sinto medo!

Tinha tanto medo de sair da cama à noite pro banheiro
Medo de saber que não estava ali sozinho porque sempre
Sempre, sempre
Eu estava com Deus!
Eu estava com Deus!
Eu estava com Deus!
Eu tava sempre com Deus!

Minha mãe me disse há tempo atrás
Onde você for Deus vai atrás
Deus vê sempre tudo que cê faz
Mas eu não via Deus

Mas eu tinha medo!
Eu tinha medo!

Vacilava sempre a ficar nu lá no chuveiro, com vergonha
Com vergonha de saber que tinha alguém ali comigo

Raul Seixas,"Ao chegar do interior
Inocente, puro e besta
Fui morar em Ipanema
Ver teatro e ver cinema era a minha distração

Foi numa sessão das dez
Que você me apareceu, me ofereceu pipoca
Eu aceitei e logo em troca
Eu contigo me casei

Curtiu com meu corpo
Por mais de dez anos
E depois de tal engano
Foi você quem me deixou

Curtiu com meu corpo
Por mais de dez anos
E depois de tal engano
Foi você quem me deixou

Curtiu com meu corpo
Por mais de dez anos
E foi tamanho o desengano
Que o cinema incendiou",Sessão das 10
Raul Seixas,"Hoje é segunda-feira e decretamos feriado
Chamei Dom Paulo Coelho e saímos lado e lado
Lá na esquina da Augusta quando cruza com a Ouvidor
Não é que eu vi o Sílvio Santos
Não é que eu vi o Sílvio Santos
Sorrindo aquele riso franco e puro
Para um filme de terror
Como é que eu posso ler
Se eu não consigo concentrar minha atenção
Se o que me preocupa no banheiro ou no trabalho
É a seleção
(Vê se tem Kung Fu aí em outra estação)

Já na outra esquina
Dei três vivas ao rei Faiçal
O povo confundiu pensando que era o carnaval
Então eu disse a Dom Paulete, eu conheço aquele ali
Não é possível, Dom Raulzito
Não é possível, Dom Raulzito
Quem que no Brasil não reconhece o grande trunfo do xadrez
Saí pela tangente disfarçando uma possível estupidez
Corri para um cantinho pra dali sacar o lance de mansinho
(Adivinha quem era? Mequinho!)

Lá em Nova York todo mundo é feliz
Vi o Marlon dançando o último tango de Paris
Pedi cerveja e convenci ao garçom do botequim
A não pagar o tal do casco
Ele aceitou, pois sou um astro!
E duma cobertura no Leblon
Quelé acena dando aquela
Enquanto o povo embaixo grita
É o Rei Quelé despenca da janela
É quando, a 120, o Fittipaldi passa e quem ele atropela
(Meu Deus! Mequinho no chão, mais três velas)

Raul Seixas,"Muitas vezes, Pedro, você fala
Sempre a se queixar da solidão
Quem te fez com ferro, fez com fogo, Pedro
É pena que você não sabe não

Vai pro seu trabalho todo dia
Sem saber se é bom ou se é ruim
Quando quer chorar vai ao banheiro
Pedro, as coisas não são bem assim

Toda vez que eu sinto o paraíso
Ou me queimo torto no inferno
Eu penso em você, meu pobre amigo
Que só usa sempre o mesmo terno

Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Mas tudo acaba onde começou
Tente me ensinar das tuas coisas
Que a vida é séria e a guerra é dura
Mas se não puder, cale essa boca, Pedro
E deixa eu viver minha loucura

Lembro, Pedro, aqueles velhos dias
Quando os dois pensavam sobre o mundo
Hoje eu te chamo de careta, Pedro
Que você me chama vagabundo

Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Mas tudo acaba onde começou

Todos os caminhos são iguais
O que leva à glória ou à perdição
Há tantos caminhos, tantas portas
Mas somente um tem coração

E eu não tenho nada a te dizer
Mas não me critique como eu sou
Cada um de nós é um universo, Pedro
Onde você vai eu também vou

Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Mas tudo acaba onde começou
É que tudo acaba onde começou",Meu Amigo Pedro

Lá por detrás da triste
Linda zona sul
Vai tudo muito bem
Formigas que trafegam
Sem porque

E da janela
Desses quartos de pensão
Eu como vetor
Tranquilo eu tento
Uma transmutação

Do Disco Voador
Me leve com você
Pra onde você for

Enquanto eu sei que tem
Tanta estrela por aí

Andei rezando para
Totens e Jesus
Jamais olhei pro céu

Já fui macaco
Em domingos glaciais
Atlantas colossais
Que eu não soube
Como utilizar

E nas mensagens
Que nos chegam sem parar
Ninguém, ninguém pode notar
Estão muito ocupados
Pra pensar

Oh! Oh! Seu Moço!

Me leve com você
Pra onde você for

Raul Vale,"Me llevaré conmigo todas las madrugadas 
Y enhebrando vivencias la canción trasnochada 
Que nace en la bohemia de amigos y guitarras 
Para que me acompañe dondequiera que vaya 
Me llevaré conmigo en los pliegues del alma 
La sonrisa de un niño, es decir la esperanza,  
Esa brisa constante que sostiene mis alas 
Y que va por delante remolcando mis ansias 

Me llevaré conmigo los zapatos gastados  
En todos los caminos por los que he caminado 
Por los muchos amigos volverí­a descalzo  
A pesar de las piedras si fuera necesario 

Me llevaré conmigo la presencia de tantos  
A los que no he podido estrecharles la mano  
La próxima nos vemos y cualquier escenario  
Será el sitio adecuado para darles mi canto 

Me llevaré conmigo, de las cosas mas bellas,  
Un sarape tejido con tejido de estrellas  
Y un sombrero de luna, del cielo de esta tierra  
Para que me cobijen el frí­o de la ausencia, 

Me llevaré conmigo, Gustavo, que te pasa  
Si el tiempo es un instante y un instante es mañana  
Mañana nos veremos, mañana es cualquier dí­a,  
Tiene leña la llama y seguirá encendida 

Me llevaré conmigo la emoción florecida  
De saber que sonaron por mi las golondrinas 
Esta canción que acaso no es canción sino alma  
Que se entrega al hermano cuando extiende sus alas 

Y me iré lentamente, con el último aplauso,  
Con el último vuelve y con el último abrazo  
Yo sé que nos veremos cuando Dios lo decida  
Dejo aquí­ lo que tengo: esta mano tendida",Me Llevare Conmigo

Verse 5:
Thank you, for all the times we shared
For the words that should of been heard
Now you want it, you want it so f**king bad. (so f**king bad)
TICK TICK, you choose to look big,
But on the ranch your sweet, sweet, sweet,
I've tasted all of this.

And I don't wanna walk alone
Past midnight
I finally get you on the phone
I know I did you wrong
Please don't leave me alone
You said I can't love you right
But girl I can love you right
Cause I could lose it all in the flames

And still have you

Bein' spiteful
Stop doin' shit to get in my head
But I want you
So I don't even get upset
It's just cause I did you wrong
You just want to do me wrong
You said I can't love you right
But two wrongs don't make it right
And even through all of this pain

I still want you

Bitches be havin' beef with me that I don't even know about
That shit stupid
You know what, tell these bitches to go get a bone
Cause I'm a real player, player

Good, good, get this understood
I ain't out here lumberjackin' but I wish I would
Fuck with another nigga, what with another nigga
I'ma swear to God, you'll be stuck with another nigga
And I thought you loved the clouds
So just tell me of a place that you just wanna go
We can take a quick vacation, no one has to know
Computerized lovin', love is all you need

And I just want you

Promise you gon' ride 'til the windows fall off
We will never die, we will never fall off
If this shit is real, baby if this shit is real
Love don't ever end, baby that's part of the deal, deal, deal

My heart's been punctured, I'm dysfunctional
Love was unconditional, now it's prenuptial
Corrupted by friends and neighbors, girl is crazy
Behavior changin', plans rearrangin'
Now I want you back, like ""What's happenin'?""
Watchin' reruns of Todd Bridges and Janet Jackson
Different strokes for different folks
Shoppin' at Chanel for matchin' coats
Even though I know you want to slit my throat when I see you
I still want you
No matter what I do, yo I still want you

Raury,"Forbidden knowledge can destroy mankind

I spend large hours of my days alone
I don't believe we share this universal space alone
I think we got a lot from them, they gave us phones
Internet and now we all know what is forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge is too great for a man
Think if man could read your mind, you think that man understands
How to use it with integrity, not conquering land
Would it be good if we increased the lifespan, well that's forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge can destroy mankind
We can grow out of control like cancer under the skin of Mother Nature
Busy cities much alike to a tumor
Too many cells, the residents, the body's pollutor
I say woosah and alley-oop the chubby doobie to Judah
Child of Jacob, I know my history, I know we are moors
There's a universe in her afro, hold us back though
Power in the black folk, well that's forbidden knowledge
At first they want to keep us separate but equal
But it's not so we fight against the hatred and evil
Now they let us think we got it and they killin' our people
Why does history repeat like a sequel? Well that's forbidden knowledge
Is God a man watching TV like people?
Rewinding his favorite parts to play it back like it's TiVo
Have I wrote this shit before? It all feels like a redo
Deja vu is left to die like our dreams do, but that's forbidden knowledge
I had some shocking memories as a kid
Waking up onto a table, a lab, some typa bizz
Too vivid to be a nightmare, mom would tell me that shit
Can't remember anything that they did, guess that's forbidden knowledge

Forbidden knowledge

Are dreams another kind of preview to Heaven?
We manifest our reality based on our personality
Karma from shit we did since the day we were seven
You share toys? Or did you masturbate at eleven
Just a 90s baby, a millennial kid
Indigos are on the rise to make perennial shift
Hope this music stands long as Redwood Sequoias
Pyramids and stones, like stones from Stonehenge
Come on, let the future tell the truth
Cause you a shell of you
You played your cards wrong, now you got hell in you
Be glad I still retain respect for you
Cause I got bullets that'll kill yah if your vest is hell and heaven-proof
I'll never understand your corporate greed
Just a group of people, all they want is more than they need
Signing off on papers, blinded to the pain overseas
Blood resulting from the ink that they bleed, that's forbidden knowledge

Forbidden knowledge

So who put the liquor store on the street across from the gun shop?
The park a hop skip in the dark 'way from the gunshots
That rang out in the neighborhood where the youth's misunderstood
Fighting over concrete squares but the laws just ain't no good
I think their agenda's meant to kill us all
How good is education long as you can ball?
Standin' on the couch inside the club and hit the mall
Barely feed a bum, but you buy it all
Think they laughin' at us, cause while we're watchin' some cable
They was talkin' 'bout the economy, sharecroppers and stables
How to keep the horse runnin' his course, give him some blinders
So he lack remorse for whoever's right beside him
His own kind, I pray you dig deeper
If you don't find, what you're lookin' for on the surface
The knowledge that you need can't be Nextel chirpin'
You're every bit of worth it, not worthless
You're kings and queens, were meant for better things
Than flexin' on the scene, or burstin' out the seams
Of your blouse you told yourself you'd never wear outside your mama's house
Cause the energy it lends puts strong women down, down
Brother, look, you don't need to go to jail to read you a book

Or the mindstate of Martin after visitin' Selma

I don't give a shit, my mind is filled up with hate
My breakfast is freezing, the milk has gone off
I feel like telling the world to fuck off
I ain't got no money, I'm late for the train
If I don't get out of here, it's gonna drive me insane
Why does nothing ever turn out right

Life's a bitch
When it's got you by the balls
Life's a bitch

When you feel the squeeze
My brand new motor's almost made out of rust
And my bank account has almost bit the dust
My baby's screaming that she needs now clothes
She had a hundred dollars but she stuck it up her nose
Hey why don't you shut your mouth

Life's a bitch
When it's got you by the balls
Life's a bitch

When you feel the squeeze
The rent collector's knocking hell out the door
The Sunday dinner's plastered over the floor
I can't understand what the hell have I done
I just got to try and get my hands on a gun
Why does nothing ever turn out
Just the way it oughta turn out
Anyway you look, there ain't no doubt

Life's a bitch
When it's got you by the balls
Life's a bitch
When you feel the squeeze
Life's a bitch
When it's got you by the balls

Raven-Symoné,"Alice lives in a place that I am envious of.
Yellow dragons,violet cats and black talking purple knobs.
She steps on anything that might get in her way of home.
YOU.
Alice had love but she pushed all of her people away.
She felt as if she was alone distant uglt afraid.
She didn't know that her life was already made.
You're loved and you will find, someone with your frame of mind.
SO if you would be so kind, not to crossthat line.
And fall into a world where everything is flipped and where you fly to swim and you fly to drive.
Fly with me in the sea, swim with me in the breeze,
Drive with me on the clouds, fly with me on the ground.
Follow me into my rabbit hole, and I'llshow you everything I've been told, 
and I'll lead you to a land unknown where happiness is grown.
I live in a world were Alice would be envious of.
Everybody's mind is closed,there falls a white dove.
Find your treasured feather and you better treat it right.
Petals can unfold all at one time or all at the drop of a dime.
With tragic reds and joyous reds of a blue yesturday
it makes me crazy to hear of your purple yellow haze.
Alice had it great I want to be like her someday in a world where
everything is flipped and people are stuck in the maze.
Fly with me in the sea, swim with me in the breeze, drive with me
on the clouds, fly with meon the ground.
Follow me into my rabbit hole, and I'll show you everything I've been told,
and I'll lead you to a land unknown where happiness is grown.",Alice

Raven-Symoné,"It's the way you're nervous when you speak
The way I know just what you mean
It's the kind of thing that's bitter sweet
It's the funny feeling deep inside
So many different sides but still so easy to define
Cause you know it every time and not just in your mind
But you can feel the butterflies
Sendin' chills down your spine
What is love?
But a kiss on a rainy day
A smile that won't go away
A safe place to run
What is love?
But a complicated simple truth
A bond between me and you
The number one
Uh that's love
And the things that never cross your mind
You're doin' all of the time
It's with someone special, it's alright
It's like dancing when you walk
And singing when you talk
Your happy just to be alive
But in the mornin',
Don't pretend,
Let it go and take it in
You don't have to understand
The how, why, and when's
What is love?
But a kiss on a rainy day
A smile that won't go away
A safe place to run
What is love?
But a complicated simple truth
A bond between me and you
The number one
So take off your hat and stay for a minute
Love is a precious thing if you let it
In you'll never know what you'll find till you give it,
Sometime, sometime
What is love? (what is love? Yeah)
But a kiss on a rainy day (a kiss on a rainy day)
A smile that won't go away (a smile that won't go away)

Raven-Symoné,"She was a young girl, eighteen
Addicted to the dreams of bein' on the big screen
Then late one nigh, kissed her mama goodbye
Took the keys to the car and drove off in the night

Don't be in a rush to leave
You'll never get these days again
But she was blinded by all the stars in her eyes

All she wanted was the Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
But when the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground

She was raised in a small town
She's been here for a year, her body losin' weight now
Never called back home, she's embarrassed to go
She don't eat, she don't sleep, all she hearing is no

She feels like there's no place to go
There's no one there to hold her close
So in comes the night with the tears in her eyes

All she wanted was the Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh, woah

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground

All she wanted was to live the life
Her mom got a call form her baby late one night
It was crying on the other end of the phone
She told her baby please just come back home
Everything is going to be alright this time

Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down you can hear the sounds of the dreams

Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground

Raven-Symoné,"There's a photo book that can tell you countless things of me
So many memories, I remember every one of them
One look and the moment comes right back to me

I can see it clearly, all the details right in front of me
And all so heavenly, every story, every moment
Playing back just like it's on a movie screen

It's all there
It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
Capture pieces of my life like a voyage into time
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
All the faces, all the places, my gentle memories
It's all there

I remember this like it happened just moments ago
My laughter wouldn't cease like escaping into history
Quiet little voyage of a memory

It amazes me to see what has come of me
Still but yet in motion, worth a thousand words or even millions more
It's right here

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
Capture pieces of my life like a voyage into time
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
All the faces, all the places, my gentle memories
It's all there

Flipping through the pages are the many stages, different ages
As time passes by life flashes right in front of me, who'd have guessed
The things that were to come from reflections of what used to be

It amazes me to see what has come of me
Still but yet in motion, worth a thousand words or even million more
It's right here

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
Capture pieces of my life like a voyage into time
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
All the faces, all the places, my gentle memories
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
Capture pieces of my life like a voyage into time

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures

Raven-Symoné,"I'm just walking, girls were talking
Nothing crazy, a typical night
Situation we always facing, haters hating
They must have no life

I can't stand how do they manage
To find my flaws that I'm sure
There is something they could be doing
Other then thinking about me

Things will always be like this
As long as jealously exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin

They still lookin', keep it pushin'
Run into the ultra mistakes
Something happened as we were passin'
Made me stop, I had to say something

Hey, there ladies is this the way
We should do each other? If it's that tape
Take the energy you use to hate on me
It will get you further

No, that's just not me
I'll never agree with negativity
You can keep that over there

Things will always be like this
As long as jealously exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin

What's this about? She won't get off it
Staring like she wanna get into it, blaze and skip
Finally I had to approach, she tells me
Tells me her man's the one I can't get with, wait hold it
Is that what this about? Girl, please

Things will always be like this long
As long as jealousy exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

We don't need to waste the time
Maybe this is all a sign
Way I see it's good to know
Here's the problem, let it go

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin

Raven-Symoné,"He who asks for a friend
Must first prove himself friendly
Trials will come, will you be
Fair weathered or will you be steady?
Surely, firmly, are you my friend?

We were close, closer than most
More than friends, nothing could come between us and then
Arguments and experience
Came creepin' in, how long has it been?

Didn't want you to leave, we couldn't agree
So I said to you stop talkin' to me
That's where we left and now I'm reconsidering
I did the wrong thing, girl, listen to me

Tell me, what's up? I've had enough
How do we get back on telling you sorry?

That's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend
And that's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend

I told you things never told nobody
We shared everything
Somebody told you I was in town
Where was I? Had you gotten a reply?
I apologize wish you'd come around

Didn't want you to leave, we couldn't agree
So I said to you stop talkin' to me
That's where we left and now I'm reconsidering
I did the wrong thing girl, listen to me

And that's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend
That's how you keep a friend

Can't even remember why we fell apart
But I'm so glad we got back together
Girl, you're like a sister to me
So much more than a friend
So make sure it don't happen again

Tell me, what's up? I've had enough
How do we get back on telling you sorry?

Keep a friend, keep a friend
Tell her you're sorry when you're wrong

I can't just get, get enough, no
Always stay in love

I wanna let you go, tell me you need me
But you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Why can't I let you see, you are the only one for me?
Oh, how I need you but you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Leave me, ohh, oh leave me, baby, ohh, oh leave me, ohh

My heart is broken apart because of you, baby oh
Can't think about nobody else and I can't help it
But you're not ready for me to love you like I do
As many times that you heard me, you shouldn't desert me
But you're there forever that I won a million, yeah

Why can't I let you see, you are the only one for me?
Oh, how I need you but you gotta love me or leave me

Oh, anything just to bring you around

You are lost inside yourself
All your faces I have seen
And yet you still surprise me
Always thought I knew the person
Always thought I knew you
But right now I must confess
That I know little of what you do
Illusions rose up in my mind
Illusions of our future
Created a perfect world
But this world is without you
Always thought I could help you
Always thought you needed me

There was nothing I could do

It only exists within our minds

I step up, with a whattup, whattup I'm on you
are next, what you'd expect a strong rhyme
It goes like this, for a long time
Cause ticka time is money (money) and money is ticka time (time)
And Money gets money everytime, that I go for mine
Line after line, like a laser
I be what they call a leaper, for the ways I
leap into the airwaves, sky with the rhyme flow
Droppin bombs on the others below
And while I'm climbin, they seem to get smaller than ants
And I'm hyped, cause I can see 'em dancin
And the few, standin 'round waitin
for me to come down, but I keep elevatin
Cause yo, I get up, and then continue to climb..

You're just another perpetratin sucker that steals
While I was makin rhymes, you made crack deals
Thought it was funny you - said ""Yo Money's through""
Heard it and hippidy-hopped on like a bunny do
Silly rabbit, kick the habit
Stop smokin, I'm from Oakland
And all that means is that I know where I'm from
and where I'm goin to, cause I'm a (?), see?
I'm kickin it out, better than nice, I'm naughty
Backstage I kiss my girl and my forty
I hear my name cause my people, support me
And those who don't know say, ""Go shorty! Go shorty!""

ace to be your number one I'm sharp as a knife
Short in stature yet the rep I get is larger than life
And I'm doin this for the Money, and not for my health
And you're correct if you suspect, I'm stuck on myself
I'm not tall, but when I play ball, I take - charge

They try a double team, but I don't play that poop

Another sucker steps, and so I give him the shake
I give the next one a dose, of the same old drug
As I dip through the hole, he tried to plug
And the last MC in my path, with seconds to go
Standin bout six ten and a half

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far

Ray Anthony,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

Ray Anthony,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Ray Anthony,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

And with a smile he'd change my tears to laughter

Ray Anthony,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Ray Anthony,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

Here's that rainy day they told me about

Ray Anthony,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird

Don't go nowhere
What do I care?

Ray Anthony,"I'm doing all I can... to separate your hate from me
It always seems to be the way you look at me...
That gives it all away

No one around you cares, about you or your sacred ways
They only see a sacred fist, they only see a bomb today

I believe in a world that can take you high
In a place where patience can prevail
I believe in a thought that can set you free
And the seeds of hatred always fail

In your mind you can't forget what evil has been done to you
It lives in what you say or do and dictates your reality
But your soul is clean, disinfected by your innocence
And while it makes no sense, you pursue a slave's insanity

I believe in a world that can take you high
In a sky where sunshine breaks the clouds
I believe in a thought that can set you free
In a mind that hears it's heartbeat
Loud

But you won't let go... because you're always right
And you won't say no, so you die tonight

I believe in a world that can take you high
In a place where patience can prevail
I believe in a thought that can set you free
And the seeds of hatred always fail
I believe in a world that can take you high

I believe in a thought that can set you free
In a mind that hears it's heartbeat
Loud.... (so loud)",I Believe
Ray Anthony,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

Ray Anthony,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Ray Anthony,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,

Ray Anthony,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Ray Anthony,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Ray Anthony,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul

Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

You can go and tell your brother.

For my transgressions
And that He paid that price
A long, long time ago

When He gave His life for me
On a hill called Calvary
But there's something else
I want to know

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail?
Does He hear the crowd cry
Crucify, again?

Am I causing Him pain?
Then I know I've got to change
I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

It seems that I'm so good
At breaking promises
And I treat His precious grace
So carelessly

But each time He forgives
What if He relives
The agony He felt on that tree?

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail?
Does He hear the crowd cry
Crucify, again?

Am I causing Him pain?
Then I know I've got to change
I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord

Ray Boltz,"I was in the crowd
The day that Jesus died
And as He hung upon the cross
His mother cried

I saw the crown of thorns He wore
The stripes upon His back
The water and the blood ran out
And then the sky turned black

My mind was filled with anger
My heart was filled with shame
This man brought only healing
Who could bring Him pain

Why does it seem the strong
Always victimize the weak?
And suddenly I found myself
Standing to my feet

And I cried, ""Who nailed Him there?
This Child of peace and mercy
Who nailed Him there?
Come and face me like a man
Who nailed Him there?""

And the crowd began to mock me
I cried, ""Oh my God, I do not understand""
Then I turned and saw the hammer
In my hand

I am just a Roman soldier
An ordinary man
I love my wife and children
I do the best I can

How could I have killed Him?
It must be someone else
There's got to be an answer
I just can't blame myself

And I cried, ""Who nailed Him there?
This Child of peace and mercy
Who nailed Him there?
Come and face me like a man
Who nailed Him there?""

And the crowd began to mock me
I cried, ""Oh my God, I do not understand""
Then I turned and saw the hammer
In my hand

I nailed Him there
The child of peace and mercy
I nailed Him there
I am the guilty man

I nailed Him there
With my sins and my transgressions
I cried, ""Oh my God, now I understand
When I turned and saw the hammer in my hand""
",The Hammer
Ray Boltz,"Walking on the road to Jerusalem, 
The time had come to sacrifice again, 
My two small sons,
They walked beside me on the road,
The reason that they came was to watch the lamb.

""Daddy, daddy, What will see there,
There's so much that we don't understand"",
So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".
""There will be so many in Jerusalem today,
We must be sure the lamb doesn't run away"",
And I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".

When we reached the city,
I knew something must be wrong, 
There were no joyful worshipers, 
No joyful worship songs,
I stood there with my children 
in the midst of angry men, 
Then I heard the crowd cry out
""Crucify Him"".

We tried to leave the city but 
we could not get away, 
Forced to play in this drama
a part I did not wish to play,
""Why upon this day were men condemned to die?, 
Why were we standing here, Where soon they would pass by?"".

I looked and said, ""even now they come"",
The first one cried for mercy, 
The people gave him none, 
The second one was violent,He was arrogant and loud, 
I still can hear his angry voice 
screaming at the crowd,
Then someone said ""there's Jesus"", 
I could scarce believe my eyes, 
A man so badly beaten,
He barely looked alive, 
Blood poured from His body, 
From the thorns upon His brow, 
Running down the cross, Falling to the ground.

I watched Him as He struggled, 
I watched Him as He fell, 
The cross came down upon His back,
The crowd began to yell, 
In that moment I felt such agony, 
In that moment I felt such loss,
Till a Roman soldier grabbed my arm
and screamed, ""you, carry His cross"".

At first I tried to resist him,
Then his hand reached for his sword,
So I knelt and took the cross from the Lord,
I placed it on my shoulder,
And started down the street,
The blood that he'd been shedding
was running down my cheek.

They led us to Golgotha, 
They drove nails deep in His feet and hands,
Yet upon the cross I heard Him pray
""Father, forgive them"".

Oh, never have I seen such love in any other eyes,
""Into thy hands I commit my spirit"" 
He prayed and then He died,

I stood for what seemed like years,
I'd lost all sense of time until 
I felt two tiny hands holding tight to mine,
My children stood there weeping,
I heard the oldest say,
""Father please forgive us,the lamb ran away"".

""Daddy, daddy, What have we seen here?,
There's so much that we don't understand"",
So I took them in my arms,
And we turned and faced the cross,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb""",Watch the Lamb
Ray Boltz,"Caught in the valley of shadow,
Fear and doubt
Desperately searching
There was no way out

Came reaching for me
Lifted me out of my broken past

Into the land of the free

I'm living in a brave new world

I stand on a mountain of possibilities
I hear You calling me to spread my wings
I know you'll hold me up, Lord
When I feel too weak to fly
Cause its through the power of your love

Ray Boltz,"In the heart of the believer
Burns a fire for the soul
To light the way
And fight against the cold
But if we all would gather
Joining hearts in one accord
The blaze would rise much higher

[CHORUS:]
One single flame
An everlasting light
Shining through the darkness
Shattering the night
A healing fire
Lifting up the Saviors name
May a world of true believers
Burn one single flame

With traditions from the past
Its hard to move forward looking back
For the Fathers kingdom
We must set aside these walls
Standing undivided
Let us rise up for his call

Ray Boltz,"For them there were no presents
Around the Christmas tree
No flashing lights unless you count
The lamp across the street
A fire in a barrel
No chimney and no roof
To most of them Santa Claus
Was the man who made the soup

In an alley was a mother
Two children by her side
Trying hard to keep the spark
Of true Christmas alive
She said we may not have some things
That other people do
But Christmas is for everyone
And were Gods children too

Oh and Jesus loves you
And so do I
Think about the baby
And the star up in the sky
I don't think Santa's comin'
Cause he don't know where we live
But who needs Christmas presents
We already have the gift

Well early Christmas morning
While they were still asleep
I packed a box of food and clothes
And walked back to their street
Imagine my surprise
When I saw presents all around
Blankets, toys and winter coats
Beside them on the ground
And the card I read from Santa said
Inside the three of you
The real heart of Christmas
Is still beating strong and true

Oh and Jesus loves you
And so do I
Think about the baby
And the star up in the sky
Santa Claus is comin
Cause he know where real faith lives
But who needs Christmas presents
We already have the gift
Who needs Christmas presents
We already have the gift
Who needs Christmas presents
We already have the gift",The Gift

Ray Boltz,"I was listening to my radio 
When something went wrong 
The voice of the announcer 
Suddenly came on He said 
""we interrupt this program with late
Breaking news, Last night they 
Arrested the King of The Jews"" 
He said ""we take you now to 
Pilate's house where Christ 
Is on trial"" It sounded like 
The announcer was wearing a smile 
As he described the accusations 
In the judgement hall 
And How Jesus just stood 
There didn't say nothing at all 
""Get ready everybody, 
The judgement's comin' down""
I held my breath, I closed my eyes 
I didn't make a sound 
""Jesus defeated"" was all that he said,
""Guilty, convicted and sentenced to death, 
Soon it will be finished on a cross made of wood 
Looks like its over for good, Jesus defeated""

His next few words 
I could hardly believe, 
He said ""we're standing 
Here at Calvary's tree, 
The sky has turned black,
 blood covers the land, 
From the spear in His side 
And the nails in His Hands,
Now some called him a Saviour,
Said He lived without sin,
Some said it did not do much for Him, 
Some called Him Messiah, God's only Son, 
Others shook their heads and 
Said the good die young.""
""Jesus defeated"" was all that He said 
""Guilty , convicted & now He is dead,
Yes, it is finished on a cross made of wood, 
Looks like it's over for Good,Jesus Defeated""


(spoken) 
Yeah, Jesus is defeated when 
You look at the grave,
Until you see that the 
Stone's been rolled away,
Jesus is defeated when you 
Look at all the pain He had to feel 
Until you read Isaiah 53 and 
It says that's the way we were healed
And Jesus was defeated when you 
Look at everything He went through
And then you realize He went 
Through it for me and you, 
Things in the media they're not 
Always what they seem, 
Jesus is alive, do you know what that means? 
End spoken)


It means, Jesus defeated 
The power of death, 
Oh yes it happened 
Just like He said, 
He bore our sins on 
A cross made of wood
He triumphed over evil for good 
And the one who built 
His kingdom on bondage and fear, 
The one who killed the prophets, 
Left their families in tears,
The father of lies, the author of sin, 
Everybody this just in, it was him ....

Words and music by Ray Boltz
I heard Him call my name
He said I've come to save you
But I was so ashamed
I turned to walk away
He reached out His hand
And said I have something to show you
And what I saw changed my life that day

I saw His scars
No He didn't try to hide them
He said, Come and look inside them
They are a window to my heart
And don't forget I love you
Just the way you are
I knew it must be true

I said Lord my scars are deep
And I don't want You to see them

By things I chose to do

At the ones that I am wearing
Don't you know I chose these scars too?

The choir is singing, 'Just As I Am'
And now as the old song is played
People at the altar
Are kneeling down to pray

Some are finding mercy
Forgiveness for their sin
Some are fighting battles
And they're struggling to win

The time has come
To give them to the Lord
That's what the altar is for

That's what this altar is for
You don't have to carry
Those burdens anymore

There's a light in the darkness
There's a love that's true
And Jesus is waiting
He is waiting here for you

Go quickly now
Before they close the door
That's what the altar is for

A father is praying with his son
A mother kneels beside them
Thanking God they've come

An old man
Is standing there in tears
Giving up a part of him
That he's held back for years

Hearts are being broken
Lives are being changed
And those who call upon Him
Will never be the same

The time has come
To give in to the Lord
That's what this altar is for

That's what this altar is for
You don't have to carry
Those burdens anymore

There's a light in the darkness
There's a love that's true
And Jesus is waiting
He is waiting here for you

Go quickly now
Before they close the door
And you can give your burdens

When I realized we had nothing to fear
It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope
Making music that nobody would hear
And then the sun let up and it split the night
Spilling over our jubilee
Ten thousand cars by the side of the road
Grooving far as the eye can see

Said take me home

Like I was swimming in a sea of soul
The sun was rising and the day was hot
And we was all about to lose control
My daddy turned his face up towards the sky
And I knew that there was nothing to lose
I felt the crowd breathe in and I closed my eyes
And we disappeared into the groove

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

And you'll be met there by others like you

Ray Brown,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you

Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track

I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine

Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone

And if the truck get pulled over while we smoking the hooch
Just hike up your skirt and stash the weed in your cooch
I need an everlasting joint, that don't cause lung cancer
And for her to get naked, and be my private dancer
I need huge boobs, on the daily in my face

I need collegiate pussy singing we can get down

I need to stay clean with a backpack full of hats
I need them and they need me

'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

Like to welcome you to Cleveland, this the home of Ray Scrilla
Where we all blow swishers, all chase figures
With our eye on the prize, while the law chase niggaz, get high!
Comtemplate the paper chasing but them crackas giving complications
Locking niggaz up without a combiniton, prison is not in my vision
Even though it coincide with the life and the way that I'm living
My mind designed with a divine sense of division, multiplication and addition
I'm a math-a-gician, I was taught to subtract anything trying to intervene and
To distract the type of paper that I'm trying to attract
We really don't wanna have to clap, but if it has to happen
Its happened as simple as that, chip stacking rather its coming from
Jacking the packs, I hustle, but it just so happen I rap, and I'm back and this is...

I applaud you all, you deserve an ovation
But hit the blunt for those in isolation, got hot knocked
Inside of a box pacing, waiting, patient for they day of arraignment
Worried about they family and time they facing
Look don't worry about the streets, the streets ain't changing
Me I'm doing good dog, hope y'all maintaining
These hos ain't changed man, we still bang em
When theirs beef off in the street we still flaming
But don't worry about the drama, nigga worry about your mama
Write her letters, I'll fly you this kite, know your nights is hard
Know you hate it in the yard, rather be out here pushing raw
But when you get released, come holla at your dog
And we can give these fuckas...huh

So if its you and I, uno got to go then you should know I must survive
Ain't no surprise, money values always out a niggaz' life
Before I snitch I bet I die, no witness live to testify
I let the fact remain, leave the crack or rap game
My shit the same, only face I change at a green exchange
From George, to Abe, from Abe to Andy, Jack to Grant
Ulysses and Benjis, pinkies make niggaz green with envy
My goal is not a Bently, listen my goal to have control of a digi
With 6 o's and can't nothing prevent me, simply
The nigga in me got me drinking remy, I'm greedy therefore
I'm needy and so I need more than demi, plus the flow is good and plenty

Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor an' watch the door
In between I drink
Black coffee â?¦

Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room.

Been talkin' to the shadows
One o'clock 'til four
An' Lord how slow the moments go
When all ya do is pour
Black coffee â?¦

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry.

You know a man is born to love a woman
To work and slave to pay her debts
Just because he's only human
To drown his past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
Not much heart to fight
Black coffee ...

Feelin' low as the ground
I'm waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.

Gonna drown my past regrets
In some coffee and a few cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee â?¦

Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy!
Just waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.
Please come around
Please come â?¦



",Black Coffee
Ray Charles,"Usin' the phone booth,
Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away

We just doodle all day!",Doodlin'
Ray Charles,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

And he'll be big and strong

And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Gonna set my heart at ease

Spent each dime I could afford

Counting every mile of railroad track - that moves me back

Why did I decide to roam

I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home, to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I don't remember just how I started
I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn't mean to take it further

One mint julep was the cause of it all
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

But from now on I?ll be thinking double
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know

Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down

The cold nights grow warmer
Heaven's not so far away
Whisper in my ear

Keep your secrets here

Then dream on
Dream that all the world's an actor in your play
It can all go your way

Then dream on
Yeah, dream on
Dream that all of this magnificence is yours
It will never slip away…

Ray Charles,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Ray Charles,"You've found a new love
And you say it's divine

But I'm sorry for mine

I hear you saying
It's the real thing inside
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine

Oh, how it hurts my pride
To have to step aside
And watch somebody new
Taking my place with you

But if you're happy
I don't care if I pine
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine

Ray Charles,"You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long-ago
And each has meant heaven to you
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn
And have sworn to them all you'd be true
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune,
Then you've left her to hunt a new game.
Does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's probably doing the same?

If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue,
Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed
But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear,
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.

I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how,
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies.
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine.
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now.",I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now?

When it's dark and cold
I reach out
For someone to hold
When I'm blue
When I'm lonely
She comes through
She's the only one who can
My baby grand
Is all I need

In my time
I've wandered everywhere
Around this world
She would always be there
Any day
Any hour
All it takes
Is the power in my hands
This baby grand's
Been good to me

I've had friends
But they have slipped away
I've had fame
But it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes
Spent them fast enough
As for woman
They don't last with just one man
But baby grand
Will stand by me

They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these
Played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far
From the life I've strayed in
I've got scars
From those dives I've played in
Now I'm home
And I'm weary
In my bones
Every dreary one night stand
But baby grand
Came home with me

Ever since this gig began
My baby grand's
Been good to me",Baby Grand [*]

For being with the one's we love
Sharing so much joy and cheer
What a wonderful feelin'
Watching the one's we love
Having so much fun

I was sittin' by the fire side
Taking a walk through the snow
Listening to a children's choir
Singing songs about Jesus
The blessed way that he came to us
Why can't it remain
All through the year
Each day the same
Heyeah, that's what I wanna hear
It's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas

All the kin folk gather round
The lovely Christmas tree
Hearts are glowing full of joy
Sense the gifts that we're giving
And the love that we're living
Why can't it remain
Oh all through the year
Each day the same
that's what I wanna hear
I'll tell ya
It's truly amazin'

Dream of worlds full of toys
This time of year
When Christmas is near

Evergreens are snowy white
Sleigh bells ring through the night
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

And somewhere near a steeple
People kneel and pray
And a choir sings
Carols of a Christmas Day
Mmm, can you hear me?

With loads of joy on his sleigh

On Mary's lap, is sleeping?

In the lane, snow is glist'nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In a meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"", we'll say, ""no, man
But you can do the job when you're in town""

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose get a little chillin'?
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way, walkin' in a winter wonderland

Ray Charles,"The tropic moves sides of ships at sea
But doesn't matter if my thoughts are free
Cant you see what you're doing to me
The honeybee makes a sigh at me 
The birds above sing a song of love 
Though I have cried constantly
That's not the thing to do
This feeling has me dangling on a string
With no escape seemingly
Though I have thoughts with myself that I'm lost
So let it be
Let my favorite cloud
Pass over me
Forget about
The past with glee
So if you smile real soon
I'll hear angels singing
A tune

Return, if I give you my love
Will you cause my heart to yearn, and will it bring
Me sadness, with so many tears
And will it bring me gladness, all through out the
Years

if I give you my word, will you give me your word
Too
If I vow to yours, promises me that you'll be true
Am I playing with fire, tell me are you concerned,

For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties,
Above the fruited plain,

You know, God done shed his grace on thee,
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in brotherhood,
From sea to shining sea.

From the lips that you once fondly pressed

But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year

I wonder who's kissing her now
I wonder who's teaching her how
I wonder who's looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs, telling lies

I wonder who's buying the wine for lips
That I used to call mine
I wonder if she ever tells him of me
I wonder who's kissing her now",I Wonder Who
Ray Charles,"(It's alright)
Whoah now, let me tell you now
(It's alright)
So many times I sat down and cried (it's alright)
You know there's no one to dry my weapin' eyes (it's alright)
Baby, I'm so in love with you now (it's alright)
And yet you broke my heart in two
Although you've gone away
There's nothin' I can say but ""it's alright""

(It's alright)
Baby, how could you be so mean? (it's alright)
You know, sometimes I feel like I want to scream (it's alright)
Everytime I hear someone call your name now (it's alright)
You know it almost drives me insane (it's alright)

You took my love and gone
And you know that was wrong
But it's alright (it's alright)

I want you to keep on singing, children (it's alright)
You know someday you'll need these arms of mine (it's alright)
I said it make take a long long time (it's alright)
And when things ain't what they used to be now (it's alright)

You can bring your fine self home to me
To prove my love is true
I'll hug and kiss you too
And I'll say ""it's alright""

And the ground was covered with snow

I didn't know what to do

Hallelujah, I said I ain't got no money, baby
And my best friends have put me down, oh Lord
Well, all of my good-time buddies
Don't even come around

Well, if you listen to me, baby

I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

(My mother will start to worry)
Beautiful, what's you're hurry
(And father will be pacing the floor)
Listen to that fireplace roar

(So really I'd better scurry)
Beautiful, please don't hurry

Why don't you put some records on while I pour

No cab's to be had out there

(I wish I knew how)
Your eyes are like starlight now
(To break the spell)
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

Mind if I move in closer?

What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?

I said, Savannah,
The weather there is nice and warm,
The women are the Southern brand,
But there's one thing I don't understand
They gotta gal there
A pretty gal there,
Who's colder,
Than an Arctic Storm!
She's gotta heart as cold as stone,
And even nice men,
They leave her alone

They call her Hardhearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough,
But Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who likes to see men suffer

To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say.
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man
That's Hardhearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah G-A

They call her Hardhearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Talk about your cold refrigerating mamma's
Brother she's a polar bears pajamas

To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say.

Is like being in Alaska in your B.V.D.'s

For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties,

Ray Charles,"Well, I just stopped in this evening
To get myself a little taste
The music is nice and swinging
And of course, I really dig the place

Course, I haven't
Had much sleep lately
I feel sorta down and out

Yeah, but look over there
In the corner, man
Oh, yeah, there's something
To shout about

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
Cause as soon as I pay the bartender
Girl, I'll be right there

She looked up and blushed and smiled
And my heart skipped a beat
Mmm, she's stacked from
Her head down to her feet

Hey, barkeep
You better come here and get your bread
This little girl's getting ready to split
And I'm about to go out of my head

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
I'm afraid if I lose sight of you
I just might not see you no more

She slowed up just a little bit
And turned her head and smiled
She was 34-24-38
And dressed in the latest style

I finally caught up
With the pretty little thing
Before she got out on the street

And she told she was
Waiting on her old man
Who was a policeman on the beat

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
If you're a policeman's woman

Born to lose and now I'm losing you

There's no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

Ray Charles,"[1st Verse]

You know I'm hooked for you mama
That's why you sling your weight around

You Know I'm hooked for you mama
That's why you sling your weight around

But as long as your lovin' beats your hoggin'
Little Girl I'll never put you down

[2nd Verse]

You argue when I leave for work
You argue when I get home
Everything I try to do for you
You always say that I'm wrong
I bring you home all my money
Except the little I keep for expense
And when I get home to you mama you always tell me
''Ray you ain't got nooo sense''

[Chorus]

But on the other hand baby
You I can understand

Ah, But when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make me forget about everything

[3rd Verse]

I think about the lousy way you treat me
Your always-raising sin
I know that you know that I know
That you've got another man
Ah, Half the time that I'm at home
I have to go to a café and eat
And when you argue all night long 
I have to go down to the den and sleep

[Chorus]

But on the other hand baby
Your loving eases all my pain

And when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make old Ray forget about everything

written by J. Dean [London UK]

",But on the Other Hand Baby
Ray Charles,"Girl, you're my sunshine
Chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Just like a river
Keep love flowing
Don't let our world stop
Keep it going

[Chorus]
I love you just the way you are
Honey, don't change on me
Girl, don't you change on me, girl, don't you change on me, no, no
Girl, you're my lucky star
Honey, don't change on me
Don't change on me, don't change on me

I used to wonder
Where would I find
Some kind of happiness
And peace of mind
I was living in darkness
But then you came
Bringing the sunlight
Easing my pain

[Chorus]

If there's a heaven
Then this is my prayer
Lord knows I want to know you
If we should meet there
And then forever
We'll walk together
Nothing but sunshine
No more stormy weather

[Chorus]",Don't Change on Me [1971]
Ray Charles,"Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,
Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.

When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,

Everytime we say goodbye.

Ray Charles,"In old Savannah
I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of a Southern brand
But here's what I don't understand

They got a gal there 
A pretty gal there
Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone.

They call her
Hard-hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them
To torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's hard-hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her hard-hearted Hannah,
The Vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas;
Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas

To tease them and thrill them
To torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say
An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your BVD's

She's hard-hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, GA
Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah
Anytime a woman can take a great big pan
Start pouring water on a drowning man
She's hard-hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, GA

Ooh, she's sweet as sour milk!",Hard Hearted Hannah [1960]

She's back in town again
I'll take her back again
One more time
Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again
One more time

I've been there before
And I'll try it again
But any fool knows
That there's no way to win

She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again

Oh, I was lying in the bed with fever
And I was burning up inside
My baby walked in my bedroom
And I could hardly open my eyes
She said she was going to the pawn shop
Just across the track
She started packing some clothes in a hurry
And then she said she would be right back
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away
I remember so well when she slammed the door
But the girl didn't make it back no more
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day
Well I waited for her twenty four hours
And I was just about to starve to death
It didn't look like she was coming back
So I had to look out for myself
Well I called the police department
To find out what they knew
They said, no by heck but we will get her yet
Because they were looking for her too.
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away
Well I don't know what happened across the track
But I know my baby didn't make it back
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.
Well I called my Dr. Foster
And when the girl answered the phone
I got a funny feeling
The way she said Dr. Foster had gone
She said he left with a lady patient
About twenty four hours ago
I added two and two and here's what I got
I got I'll never see that girl no mo'
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away
If Dr. foster has got her then I know I'm through
Cause he's got medicine and money too.
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.

You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I miss you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me to love another,
You'll regret it all some day

You changed the sunshine to rain
Just for a thrill
You filled my heart with pain

To me you were my pride and joy
But to you, I was merely a toy
A plaything, that you could toss around at will

You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along

I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home, to get a few nips

I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn't mean to take it further

One mint julep was the cause of it all
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

There's one that goes and one that stays
But they will meet again I know they will
You know they will

In that tinsel town of time
Let's be fair, this boring life we have to share
You know that I care honest I swear
That's what I'm yet but the facts are so unfair

They say that's pain up ahead and rivers of rain
There's nowhere to hide
And today you must make a change
So ditch us all we'll go on our own separate ways

There could be some desperate days
And when you're on the legs don't stop
And stare don't say a prayer
Just call me and I'll be there

You must be strong life is hard
And I can't stay long 'cause deep down inside
We know we tried we had our fights
But you know the tale don't lie

Listen to the sweet harmony that we used to sing
Upon other lights all the shows shown all the night
I'm back on the stage I'm turning the page

Say goodbye, please promise that you will not cry
'Cause I want you to believe in you, show me you do
That's why I sing this song of our separate ways

Sometimes I wonder, where did you disappear to
How did you get away, baby
And I often think of you
Do you ever think of me, baby
Sometimes love don't work, the way you think it should
When your love jones comes on down, baby

Ray Charles,"He came witht the name Cincinnati
A kid with no ace in the hole
On a hot poker pot, Cincinnati
Had staked his heart and soul

He played night and day like a demon
And prayed for that one lucky day
When the lush royal flush of his dreaming
Is just a game away

Beyond all the green felt shadows
His own queen of hearts will wait
But till he's king of the green felt shadows
She'll wait, and wait, and wait

For sure as the cards will be falling
And chips in the pot, he'll remain
For the book Lady Luck will be calling

With a three-hundred-dollar suit on, and a

Between a boy and a girl
Boy and girl and even a woman or a man,
It's always better when you really understand
You know understanding is a mighty powerful thing,
that's why it makes me so sad

When I see my friends wandering around through the world,
Never knowing the meaning of the word
Understanding, so in the next few minutes, I'm gonna
Try to explain just exactly what it means
Now wait a minute, listen, for instance, you take me
And my old lady, we gotta good thing goin'

Because I know If I don't work and pay the rent and the
Bills and buy her fine pretty clothes to wear well,
There are fifteen other guys just waitin' round the
Corner, and I don't care how much that woman loves me,
She's gonna go out and find herself one of them who
Will and that's why I believe that
Understanding is the best thing in the world,
Between a boy and a girl

Boy and girl and even a woman or a man,
It's always better when you really understand
Now listen I don't want you to think that this is a
One sided affair, no no
Because my old lady also understands that a man must
Have respect

What I mean is, if she must play around don't let me
Catch her, because what I don't see can't hurt me, you
Understand? but on the other hand, If I should ever
Catch her I'm not gonna talk about-a
And call her a bunch of bad names like you all might
No no 

What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go down-town to the
Hardware store and buy myself a double blade axe,
Come back, square off, and believe her soul's gonna
Belong to the good lord

Because her head's gonna belong to me, and I
Guarantee she'll know what I mean when I'll say
Understanding is the best thing in the world,
Between a boy and a girl

Ray Charles,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues
Ray Charles,"Poor little, sad little blue Bluesette
Don't you cry, don't you fret
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken
And your blues will be forsaken
Some lucky day lovely love will come your way

If there is love in your heart to share
Dear Bluesette, don't despair
Some blue boy is waiting just like you
To find a someone to be true to
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay

Get set, Bluesette
True love is coming
Your lonely heart soon will be humming

Pretty little Blusette
Musn't be a mourner
Have you heard the news yet?
Love's 'round the corner
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons
To make your next springtime
Your gold wedding ring time",Bluesette

He was a king uncrowned
I know I'll always remember
The warmth of his sound
Lingering long I'm sure he's still around
For those who heard they respect him yet
So those who hear won't forget
The sound of each phrase
Echoing time uncountable by days
The things he played are with us now
And they'll endure should time allow
Oh yes I remember Clifford
I seem to always fed him near somehow
Every day I hear his lovely tone
In every trumpet sound that has a beauty all its own

Whose ever had my heart,
Wrapped around your finger,
And every time I think of you,
I'm not surprised that the memories still linger

Just takes me further back in time,
Those memories are all I see,
Like photographs of you and me,
As I turn the pages of my mind,
The pages of my mind

Sometimes at lonely nights,
I close my eyes and feel you there beside me,
But deep inside my heart,
I know that I have only touched your memory

'Cause I still here the songs that we sing,
Each step I take down memory lane,
Just takes me further back in time,

Ray Charles,"Outside the wind blows it ? the sound of your name
Yesterdays over tomorrow is still more of the same

When i saw you leaving I wished that I'd take you to stay  
I stood in silence as you slowly slipped away

Slip away, slip away
How could I ever let you slip away

Slip away, slip away
Right through my fingers I let you slip away

If I could have told you the things that I felt in my heart
but its heart to hold on to love when its falling apart
and now that its over there's nothing more i can say
except that I'm sorry for saying too little too late

Light up my lover's way.""

And if you were mine
I would live for your love alone

Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopie

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's so killin' that he's so willin'
To make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washing dishes and baby cloths
He's so ambitious he even sows
But don't forget folks that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well you can't you guess
She feels neglected and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone most every night
He doesn't phone her he doesn't write
He says he's busy but she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says you'll pay six to her

He says now judge suppose I fail
The judge says budge right into jail
You better keep her I think it's cheaper
Then makin' whoopee

You better keep her
I know it's cheaper than makin' whoopee

Ray Charles,"Do I ever cross your mind
Darlin' do you ever see
Some situation somewhere, somehow
Triggers your memory
And do you ever wonder
What became of all the time
Honey, do I ever, ever cross your mind

Do you ever want to know
Do all dreams go on endlessly
Or do they just run down somehow
And gradually become the custody
Of that melancholy jailer for the time, oh no
Do I ever, darlin', ever cross your mind
Do I ever cross your mind
Uninvited
When you're lonely
Or does it only happen to me
Darlin', do you ever want to know
What became of all the time
I wanna know, do I ever, ever cross your mind
Oh, baby, baby

Little darlin'
Do you ever wonder
What became of all the time
Please tell me, do I ever, ever cross your mind
Do I ever, ever cross your mind",Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?
Ray Charles,"Never knew how much I love you, never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night.

Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, oh fever all through the night.

Everybody's got the fever, that is something that you should know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago.
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh
Tell 'em about it
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth.

Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
But when her Daddy tried to kill him, she said ""Daddy,Daddy don't you dare""
He gives me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right.

Now you've heard our story, (oh, it's your story)
Here's the point we have made (I'm listening)
Chicks were born to give you fever (that's right)
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn

Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.
Aha, what a lovely way to burn.
I tell you, what a lovely way to burn.
All right now, what a lovely way to burn.
I like that, what a lovely way to burn.",Fever
Ray Charles,"Hey, Girl! I want you to know,
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go.
And, Hey, Girl! I tell you  no lie,
Something deep inside of me's going to die,
if you say so long, if this is goodbye. Oh!

Hey, Girl! This can't be true,
How am I supposed to exist without you?
And, Hey, Girl! Now don't put me on,
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone.
How will I live. How can I go on.
How can I go on? Hey, Girl!

Hey, Girl! Now sit yourself down,
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground,
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!",Hey Girl
Ray Charles,"When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
And their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

But now the days grow short
I'm in the autumn of my years
And I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
And it poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year",It Was a Very Good Year
