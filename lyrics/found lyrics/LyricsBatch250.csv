Kirk Franklin,"You bring the sun out to make my love grow
To warm my life up

[Chorus]
(You bring the sun out)
You're the reason that I'm living, I was hurting but I'm happy again
(You bring the sun out)
I was hurting but I'm happy again
(You bring the sun out)
Lord I wanna thank You 'cause
(You bring the sun out, to make my love grow, you bring the sun out)
You were there when I had nothing
You've been with me from beginning to end
(You bring the sun out)
No clouds in the sky, that's the reason why
(I Love You)

Question number one (What can I do)
Question number two (What can I say)
To try to let You know (I appreciate, all of the ways You get me through my day)
Never would have thought (I would be here)
A heart with no scars (a face with no tears)
How can I thank You (how can I show You)
(Wish I could get the whole world to know You)

If they only knew (You are the one that gives me the air to breathe)
And see I can't deny that (You're the reason why my life has a melody)
And even when I stray (I still feel your grace pulling me close to You)
So no matter where You are, just know I'm not far (without You what would I do)

[Chorus]

Question number three (where would I be)
And Lord not only that but (how could You see)
My days and my nights, the pains of my life
But now it's alright ('cause You worked it out for me)
You gave me a chance (when I had no chance)
When I needed help (You gave me your hand)
So now they need to see (just what You mean to me and if You ever left me (where would I be)

[Chorus: x2]

I feel the sunlight on my life reminding me that it is alright
And I see the rainbow and I know my storm is finally passed away
There is a soft wind that begins to blow back the clouds
So I can see your perfect plan now I can hurry to my destiny",Sunshine
Kirk Franklin,"I pledge allegiance to the (tell me what we gon' do) 
I used to know you but (you don't call like you used to) 
If you still love me can I 
(Give me a chance just to say how I feel, it may hurt you but what I'm seeing is real) 

We're killing babies and (I love to see children play) 
I've got depression (there's a new pill I saw today) 

How hypocritical to 
(Nothing is wrong take a picture and just smile money's coming after while) 

Why oh why
Why oh why we keep believing lies, did Laci have to die 
Why oh why, Lord tell me when our change is gon' come 

There are no fathers and (the system's holding me down) 
Sisters are dying of AIDS (I know my man don't sleep around) 
Don't be stupid listen (we all gon' die. And since you only live once, you do you, you go head, live your life) 
We're building churches but (my pastor is on TV) 
But are we building people (I filed for divorce last week) 
We're wasting money tell me (why should I save? Let me have my worldly things; 
God said He'll upply my needs)
(That ain't what he means) 

Why oh why
Why oh why can't our soldiers come back home 
It seems like innocence is gone 
Are people still losing their jobs 
We're spending money building bombs 

Free, I just wanna be free 

Wake up no more sleeping (seems like my life ain't gon' change) 
Let's stop making excuses (I pray but things still stay the same) 
See Jesus said that He will (please take this pain, I can't make it on my own, 
Ain't no sunshine when
You're gone) 

Why oh why 
Why oh why 
Why oh why 
Why oh why don't we give you a chance 
Put our life in Your hands 
Are we afraid to say Your name 
Is it because we want the fame 
Did my homeboy have to take his life 
That homeless man's outside tonight 
When trouble comes we wanna pray 
Our country pushes You away",Why
Kirk Franklin,"I can take a plane high up in the sky and fly for a million miles
Write a melody so sweet, make a tear turn into a smile
I can see the color of spring I can even feel the weather change
And soon the leaves fall and winter calls,
'Cause nothing ever stays the same
When I think of where I've been, what I've done and all I own
How I think I know everything, like I made it here on my own
And like the wind that blows, like a flower that grows
Still with all I can do

(Without You) life's a song with no end
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend
Without You, we're just actors on a stage
Like a child who's lost his way
Wouldn't be here today without You

I admit that sometimes pride tries to hide my view
And even this gift that you gave me, I forget it's for You
And all the many days and many ways Your grace I've abused
Still you were patient and Your love loved me through
But the wind still blows and the flower still grows and one thing is still true.

(Without You) life's a song with no end
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend
Without You, we're just actors on a stage
Like a child who's lost his way
Wouldn't be here today without You

(Without You) life's a wound that won't heal
Without You, nothing in this world is for real
Without You, we're just actors on a stage
Like a child who's lost his way
Wouldn't be here today without You

Can't live, can't see Your will for me
Can't do anything
Anything

(Without You) life's a song with no end
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend
Without You, we're just actors on a stage
Like a child who's lost his way
Wouldn't be here today without You

(Without You) life's a wound that won't heal
Without You, nothing in this world is for real
Without You, we're just actors on a stage
Like a child who's lost his way
Wouldn't be here today without You

Without You, we're like a bride with no groom
Without You, it's like seeing no sunshine in June
Without You, we're just actors on a stage
Like a child who's lost his way
We wouldn't be here today
Without You, Jesus my life would be lost.
Without You, I'll never know what it cost
To see You, lay Your life down for me
From my past now I'm free
Tell me where would I be without You.
Tell me where would I be without You
Wouldn't be here today without You
Wouldn't be here today without You

I can take a plane high up in the sky and fly for a million miles",Without You
Kirk Franklin,"Lately I've been going through some things
That's really got me down
I need someone, somebody to help me come and
Turn my life around

I can't explain it
I can't obtain it
Jesus Your love is so,
It's so amazing

It gets me high, up to the sky and when
I think about Your goodness it makes me want to
Stomp
Makes me clap my hands

Makes me want to dance and Stomp
My brother can't you see I've got the victory
Stomp!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Stomp on the enemy 'cause I've got the victory

Stomp on the enemy 'cause I've got the victory",Stomp [*]
Kirk Franklin,"Tomorrow is a brand new day
All my sins have been washed away
My hands look new, my life is free
My heart is pure, I've been redeemed

I've seen His face, touched His hands
Finally now, I understand
Why He saved a wretch, a wretch like me
And by His blood, I've been redeemed

[Chorus]
We ran the race, we kept the fight
We shed our blood for what was right
We carried our cross through storm and rain
Because of Christ now we can say
We are conquerors, conquerors
We are conquerors, conquerors

I've seen His face
I've touched His hands
Finally now I understand
Why He saved a wretch
Saved a wretch like you and me
And by His blood I've been redeemed

[Chorus]

No matter what we go through
We are conquerors
Lord, I'm gonna give my problems to You
We are conquerors",Conquerors
Kirk Franklin,"Words & Music by Kirk Franklin

Let me touch You and see if You are real
Even though, I know my heart Your hands can heal
But sometimes I get discouraged
And I need Your strength and shield, Jesus
Let me touch You and see if You are real

Sometimes to me You seem so far away
And I wonder how to make it through the day
But if I can touch the hem of Your garment
Your power, I know, You can heal, Jesus
Let me touch You and see if You are real

CHORUS
When I'm down
Let me touch You
When I'm lonely
Let me touch You
When I'm discouraged
Let me touch You
Like I never have before
Lord, I need You more and more, Jesus
Let me touch You and see if You are real

Oh, see if You are real



",Let Me Touch You
Kirk Franklin,"Persecuted, criticized, been denied and abandoned 
Pushed away, given away, some days I couldn?t imagine 
Getting harder, getting colder, was hard for me to see 
Tired of runnin?, tired of hurtin?, even got tired of me 
Tired of cryin?, tired of tryin? to forget my mistakes 
Tired of bein? in this storm, how much more can I take 
Many nights in my life, tell me why 
I shed more tears, my eyes would allow 
And after all that 

(Chorus)
Look at me now! 
I?m stronger this time around! 
Not because I was so good, but somehow 
You looked past where I was 
And you knew I?d come through cause You loved me 
Look at me know! 
So many didn?t make it through 
That?s why this heart belongs to only You! 
How can I complain ?bout the pain I went through 
Cause it grew me 
Look at me now! 

Had no hope, had no future, even too hard to dream 
No one told me, ?boy, you can be whatever you want to be? 
Then You saved me and You gave me reason to breathe again 
Not perfect, ya?ll, but I?m gon? run ?til I make it to the end 
(It ain?t easy when your life?s filled with wounds that won?t heal) 
And you fight through the lies trying to find what?s for real 
Everyone wants the prize but they can?t stand the pain 
The strength I needed it came that night I cried out Your name 
To my people in the struggle, all my soldiers and believers 
To my survivors of Rita, Katrina and even FEMA!
(All things are working together for our good) 

(Chorus)
Look at me now! 
I?m stronger this time around! 
Not because I was so good, but somehow 
You looked past where I was 
And you knew I?d come through cause You loved me 
Look at me know! 
So many didn?t make it through 
That?s why this heart belongs to only You! 
How can I complain ?bout the pain I went through 
Cause it grew me 
Look at me now! 

(Bridge)
Yes, I?ve seen some hard times 
Some bad choices that I?ve made fell back on me 
But now it?s time to move on, move on 
Can?t let my past hold down my destiny 
And even though I don?t always know 
Why you allow the night to last so long 
But when I see the sunlight 
It was only to make me strong 

Look at me? 
Look at me? 
Look at me? 
Look at me, look at me

(Chorus)
Look at me now! 
I?m stronger this time around! 
Not because I was so good, but somehow 
You looked past where I was 
And you knew I?d come through cause You loved me 
Look at me know! 
So many didn?t make it through 
That?s why this heart belongs to only You! 
How can I complain ?bout the pain I went through 
Cause it grew me 
Look at me now! 

I?m better now! I?m closer now! 
I?m thankful now! I?m happy now! 
Look at me! Look at me! 
I?m stronger now! I?m patient now! 
I?m grateful now! I?ll praise you now! 
Look at me! Look at me!",Look at Me Now
Kirk Franklin,"When you fall there are angels there to catch you when you fall
There's a savior who can hear you when you call, when you call
When you cry and you cannot figure out the reasons why
Know that weeping only endures for a night, when you cry

When you fall know that God will never take His love away
He's faithful to His people come what may, hear me say
When you fall

When your heart has been shattered by the storm and torn apart
And you wonder when will the healing ever start for your heart
Don't you know that He loves you too much to ever let you go?
And the storm is there to only help you grow, He loves you so
When you fall

When you fall there are angels there to catch you when you fall
There's a savior who can hear you when you call, when you call
When you cry and you cannot figure out the reasons why
Know that weeping only endures for a night, when you cry

When you fall know that God will never take His love away
He's faithful to His people come what may, hear me say
When you fall

Wooh

Don't you know that He loves you too much to ever let you go?
And the storm is there to only help you grow
(Help you grow)
He loves you so
(Loves you so)
When you fall
When you fall
When you fall

Kirk Franklin,"""I just want to write you a letter. I have to be very honest with you right now. 
I don't really know how to say this... ""

I wanna believe
But I'm having a hard time seeing past what I see right now, I see right now
I wanna be free
But when I try to fly I realize I don't know how, no one showed me how
Wish I could see that this mess I'm in will really work out for my good, you said it would
So, if you can hear me, can you give me a sign cause I don't feel you like I should, please if you Could
My faith is almost gone, I can't hold on much longer, take this cup from me

[Chorus]
Help me believe
Can I believe
Let me believe
I wanna believe
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance
It's hard to believe in what I can't see
To give you my will cause you're what's better for
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe

(I want you to know)
I wanna believe
If I never hear I'm sorry I can let it go, gotta let you go
Cause, it's killing me. Jesus you know how it feels cause you've been hurt before, don't wanna hurt No more
I'm trying to hear you speak, but my heart is growing weaker, take this cup from me

Help me believe
Can I believe
Let me believe
I wanna believe
I've been here before and can't take that hurt again
It's hard to believe in what I can't see
To give you my will cause you're what's better for
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe

Believe
Believe

I wanna believe when I close my eyes on this side I'll wake up with you, more in love with you
And, and finally, you will say my race it is over and my work is through, cause I believed in you
I know dark nights will come and some days there'll be no sunshine and you're too far to see

Help me believe
Can I believe
Let me believe
I wanna believe
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance
It's hard to believe in what I can't see
To give you my will cause you're what's better for
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe",Help Me Believe
Kirk Franklin,"[Verse 1:]
I know you see us
I know you hear us
And you fill us when we pray
You understand us, see deep inside us
Translate tears and take them away
I'm a be honest, there are times
Your ways and method's, I don't understand
It seems so far, tell me who you are
I know your touch, but can't see your plan
I'm lost in this thing called life,
Left to me now feels right
It's your turn now, I wanna be where you are

[Chorus:]
Hide me
Let me live behind you
Cause I need
Shelter from the rain
Remind me
The only way my faith can grow
Is when you let your winds blow
You're making me stronger now, so rain,
Don't go away
Don't go away

[Verse 2:]
I'd admit
It'd be nice
To have some light shine down on me
Especially,
When, lord I shall be, you don't always let me see
It ain't easy,
But I'm trying hard to get out of your way
To believe
That what you say
That my change begins today
The road includes some pain,
And to grow you need some rain
And when it falls, I wanna be where you are

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Cause there's some much I see
Needs to grow inside of me
In the fire I realize
Before I live, I have to die
Please believe me when I say
I can't waste another day
It's so easy to complain
But complain don't make a change
Not the victim anymore
All the things god has in store
If I ain't ready don't let the rain
Go away
Don't go away

[Chorus:]
Hide me
Cause I need
Remind me
The only way my faith can grow
Is when you let your winds blow
You're making me stronger now

You're making me stronger now [x7]
You made me stronger now [x4]

Kirk Franklin,"I ain't gonna lie
I can't even count the days
Or the many nights I tried living here alone
A heart full of pride
Couldn't see the enemy was me
I was blind and thought my second chance was gone
A ship without a sail
Battered by the raging sea
Taking any love I can to try and stop the rain
While waiting to exhale I finally got on my knees
I know it's been a long time
Do you still remember my name?

Can I go back in time?
Can I have another try?
But I can't change yesterday

[Chorus]
Oh I
Can't take another day without you
Cause this heart don't beat the same without you
I forgot who I was
Got caught up in this world
Jesus I apologize
I should've lost my mind without you
Not another sleepless night without you Jesus
I'm sorry and I'm asking please
Make us how we used to be

I try and try to keep my mind on you
But trouble keeps calling me
Every time a wound heals
Something else takes the healing away
But even when I've gone too far
You don't even call my name
Mama said if you love let it go
And if it comes back then it's back to stay
You already knew I belong to only you
I run to your arms and say

[Chorus]

Never knew a life so cold
Thought that things could fulfill my soul
Tried to find love on my own
It was hard to admit I was wrong
No money, no cars, no fame, no lies, no games my life is taken

Now we've come to the break
Tell me what you gone say (you gone say)
I know (I know)
I give my life right
But you know
You ain't promised tonight
Babygirl
Without you
(I can't breathe)
Without you
(I can't exist)
Without you
(This world ain't got nothing for me
I'm coming home)

Kirk Franklin,"Toby Mac! (huh!) Turn it up!
Kirk, gonna get his white boy on!
God, I know You up to something (uhhh!) I can see it all right now (woo!) 
You pulling back my covers it's getting crazy (Come on!)

Think I'm gonna walk away
You're messing up my life today (wassup)
This time I refuse to pray
Still you keep calling me (calling me)
I don't wanna see your face
The thing I love you erased (Come on!)
Nothing but an empty space
Now I don't know how to be
I know it wasn't right for me(Yea!)
What you liking what you need
I feel like I'm in surgery
Still you cut deeper

My secrets within
My blanket of sin
Lord how much longer 'till ya through with me
Please take what you need (can I get up now!)

Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God

Loving you Lord is my way
Everything you don't explain
Somethings I don't want to change
So you keep breaking me (there you go!)
It's like I'm fighting for my life (woo!)
You hit me with another light
I feel like Jacob in the night
Won't stop 'till you bless me

My flesh and my will (yes father!)
Is yours not to kill (to kill!)
Bringing myself to you (come on!)
But living sacrifice is more (can I get up now)

Be still and know I am God (gotta know gotta know gotta know gotta know)
Be still and know (yea) I am God(gotta know gotta know one more time!)
Be still and know I am God (you are god! you are god! gotta know! gotta know!)
Be still (Be still) and know (and know) I am God (yea!)

If I could I'd fly away from here
But even when I'm far you still are near
I gotta get out (There's no way out)
Where is there to run(There's no where to run)
Don't go(Don't go)
Don't go (Can't go)
No! No! No! (Whoa!)

You win. (uh huh!)
I've been trying to do it on my own. (Yes Lord!)
But right now I gotta surrender
You know what's best (Say it like you mean it!)
It's not easy waiting on you
It's not easy believing that you got this together
But without faith it is impossible to please you (We recognize you!)
So I'm gonna stand right here. (We are still before you!)
You got me. (We are still before you!) You got me You got me

Be still and know (we know!) I am God (We gonna lift those hands I surrender to your authority God! I surrender!)
Be still (we're still!) and know (we know!) I am God (I give you my will)(Gotta know! Gotta! know! Gotta know!)
Be still (I'm yours!) and know (we know!) (I'm yours!) I am God (I'm tired of living on my own! I'm tired of living on my own!)

Short, big nose, big lips
Kinda st- st- stutter but, I never trip
Got my daddy's swagger and I walk with a limp
Got a hot wife, no need to be a pimp
Never been cute, never been fly
Since I been changed got that twinkle in my eye
Got my grill fixed, now I smile when I speak
Tell me who that is, that's the Jesus freak, it's ya boy

I just smile, I'm so content
And I ain't even got yellow stones on my wrist
I hear the world I'm supposed to be rich
Bud I don't but that, man, I don't go with the trends
Go the whole mile, lose or win
I hope that's the impression that the Cd's give
I'm more concerned about how they see me live
Than trying to get a house on MTV cribs

[Chorus]

When the light fade, I know that you see
More than my swagger, But it's you in me
From the storefront church to the packed out floors
They want an autograph but I'd rather give 'em yours
Ya ink don't fade, the crowd wants more
The king's on stage, the final encore
Can't believe it's, me now I'm chillin' backstage
Big nose, big lips, gon' get ya hands raised

Kirk Franklin,"Ooh, superstar
Never drove around in a fancy car
Kids looked at me funny
Momma she had no money but she always told me, ""baby, know who you are""
I say ooh, don't you know
It was hard always wearing my cousin's clothes
Can you hand me down a dream with those hand-me-down jeans?
Thought I'd never make, but I made it y'all, 'cause I had...

The reason I'm still breathing is 'cause

Ooh, look at me
I know I'm now all I'm supposed to be, I'm gonna get it right, didn't get here overnight, so while you're waiting please wait patiently
I say ooh, it's so sweet to know that you were always in love
Thought my game was clever, but no one can play me better than you
You know you always win cause you're

I know how that sound
It's only by his grace I can say 'look at me now' if you love this joint right here
I want you to call your radio station in the morning
And I want you to tell'em hey Mr. DJ
Can you play my favorite song? (will you play my favorite?)
I heard it say it's gonna get better we gon' make it out the hood someday
Hey Mr. DJ
I wanna hear that song about Jesus
I heard my mama crying, I gotta let her know he's gonna wipe her tears away
You are listening to the sound of a brotha' who should be dead right now
But I'm so glad god didn't give up on me!
Ain't you glad he didn't give up on you?
What's his name?

Kirk Franklin,"I see you, I need you, but I don't know your name
I touch you, say I love you, but that's all you get for today
It's easy, so easy, to tell you it's gon' be okay
When I don't walk shoes, haven't been through what you been through
Instead I push you away
Sunday everyone looks like you
But if our lives are cold inside tell me what's the use

If I say I love Jesus, but you can't see my Jesus
My words are empty, if they can't see Jesus in me
No more excuses, I give myself away
Because I may be the only Jesus they see

Too busy, forgive me, I've got problems of my own
It's easier to say your help is on the way
But I was your help all along
We're shouting, we're dancing, but can the world see a change
Am I just too selfish to see, the love they need you put inside of me

If we say we love Jesus, but they can't see our Jesus
Tell me what's the use if they can't see Jesus in you and me
No more excuses, we give it all away
Because we may be the only Jesus they see

If I am your hands and Your feet, and if your church is built inside of me
Where did we go wrong, we been here too long, we can't see your face anymore
It's not the same anymore

Have mercy on us Jesus, please forgive us Jesus
I lost my purpose, if they can't see You in me
See I lied too long, and I change it all today
Because I may be, because I may be

The only Jesus they see, the only Jesus they see, the only Jesus they see",The Last Jesus

At ya funeral we sing a sad song (sad song)
Ya mama's baby's gone
I hear the preacher say rest in peace little boy

Little girl where you goin?
Do you even know, you to young for dem clothes?

Baby take your time, and realize, tomorrow has trouble of it's own
Oh, and one mo' thing, you deserve a king cause you a queen baby girl

What happened to the days, when we knew the way, and we used to say Jesus
Now everything is gray, when trouble comes we pray

Mama, daddy what ya doin?
Ain't took a trip in years
Busy with both ya careers
Trying to make a mark
Even bought a house, but ya kids live at 106 & park
It's getting dark

A talent show or lottery?
I know I've been guilty

Kirk Franklin,"[Verse 1:]
Lately I've been thinkin'
Thinking 'bout you
And all the things
I've seen you go through
Your mother the kids and
The problems at home
Sorry I wish I could fix what's wrong
I hurt when you hurt and
I cry when you cry
Even the deep ones
Sometimes wonder why am I going through
I'm waiting but still no use

He's still in control
He's sovereign and He knows
Just how it feels to be afraid
Have folk you love walk away
Be still and know He's still in control

[Verse 2:]
Lately depression
Your job and your life
Weighs on your mind
All day and all night
You know every scripture
And what prayer to pray
Only a fool would think
It'll all go away
But there is a use
For you there's a plan
A High Priest who knows
And who understands what you cannot say
Just a little longer can you wait

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Don't know what tomorrow will bring
Or if this sickness will ever leave
You can paint a perfect picture
But will it ever look like it used to be
See, one thing I know for sure
This season made you stronger and more mature
Can't you see how far you've come
And when you look back
It's gonna be worth it, oooh

That touch I felt was you, 
I believe it 
It felt like something you would do 
How you, you keep reminding me 
That you made me for yo, I knew,
That there would be some days 
That cant be guaranteed to be blue, 
Its true, but then where would I be without opportunities to, 
Watch you change my broken life, 
Hear you tell me its gon' be alright now, 
See your plans come together in ways I cant even explain

Together we been through hard times, 
But Jesus I'm still in love with you, 
I've had many loves in my life 
But Jesus you make me feel brand new, 
You know its hard for me to believe 
That you love me no matter what I do 
So how I live, I hope you can see 
That I'm in love with you

The morning sun was you, 
I appreciate it just what I needed to get through 
Cause you knew I had a stressful day gotta get away 
With you Jesus you you make me happy 
If I wrote down all the things you do 
The list would take forever I
Thought it might be better 
To tell you why I smile is cause you, 
You bring no drama in my life 
It was dark but I can see the light now 
Everything is so beautiful to me

It was only two people and it's supposed to be 3
It's supposed to be me asking
(Why's the sky blue when I grow up I wanna be like you)
Yo daddy can you teach me how to
(Tie my shoes can I go with you to work so I can see what you do?)
Lemme see what you do
So I can love my kids too
But you didn't stick around was that too much to ask of you?
Too much to get a blueprint(No)
Too much to show your way (No)
That's the reason why this building is not finished still today(We're lost boys)

I'm feelin' real good 'cause it ain't over
Right before I die I gotta live

Live out my dreams
So I can be what He planned for me
Not just for me but so they can see
Much more of Him and less of
Right before I die I gotta

Love my enemies, forgive the past
And set 'em free so I can free
Free up the things
Every blessing God has for me
See it's for me, not just for you
I had to learn from what I've been through
I can't go through that way again
Be hurt by you that way again
It's not the end

I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like
But the sun came to give me life
Now I feel like I can touch the sky
I'm ready if you're ready

Get up and live

Right now

Get up and live

Right now

Right before I die I gotta

Change, change how I think
Change how I speak I'm not the same
So when I speak
You don't hear the pain
No longer weak with no one to
Right before I die I gotta

Become more like you
Take up my cross
To count the cost 'cause I was lost
That's why I praise you
You're the only God
I don't know what they do

I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try

What failing looked like

Now I feel like I can touch the sky
I'm ready if you're ready

Right now

Get up and live

Right now

So the next time you think of me
And you wonder where would I be
Without each blessing that helped me to see
Life is much more than things
And how you live is more than how you sing
When I die what did I really mean, I mean

Say what now? Say what? Say what now?
As we proceed, to give you what you need
Somebody, anybody, everybody, scream

I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like
But the sun came to give me life
Now I feel like I can touch the sky
I'm ready if you're ready

Right now

Get up and live

Kirk Franklin,"Hello fear
Before you sit down there's something I need to explain
Since you're here
I think I should tell you since we last talked things have changed
See I'm tired of being brokenhearted
So I made a list and you're on it
All my hopes and my dreams you took from me
I want those back before you leave

Hello fear
I knew I would see you,
You have a hard time letting go
See these tears,
Take a good look 'cause soon they won't fall anymore
God's healing my hurtful places
That seat that was yours now is taken
I'm no longer afraid, see I'm better this way
And one more thing before you leave

Never again will I love you
My heart it refuses to be your home
No longer your prisoner
Today I remember
Apart from you is where I belong
And never again will I trust you
I'm tired of fighting it's been way too long
No longer your prisoner
Today I remember
Who I was and now it's gone

They're gone, hello fear
Da da da da da, da da da da da da da

Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long

Hello grace
It feels like forever, I thought my chance with you was gone
See your face, it reminds me of mercy
And please let me say I was wrong
Never knew your touch was endless
How you never run dry of forgiveness
Didn't know how bad it was, was afraid just because
Sorry fear, grace took your place

Never again will I love you
My heart it refuses to be your home
No longer your prisoner
Today I remember
Apart from you is where I belong
And never again will I trust you
I'm tired of fighting it's been way too long
No longer your prisoner
Today I remember
Who I was and now it's gone

Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long

Before you sit down there's something I need to explain",Hello Fear
Kirk Franklin,"To the nobodies, to the abandoned
Who couldn't see in the pain was a plan
Looking back now Lord I can say thank you
Now let me tell you who I am

How do you do?
I am a sinner
Born into sin and shaped in iniquity
Now I believe not who I was but still not what I shall be
You found me and gave me your name and
Things I desired have changed but
Inside you'll see it's still broken pieces
Deep in me reaches for you (hello)

How do you do?
I am a beggar (that means I'm)
Desperate for more
I hunger for your truth
See I am shattered (broken)
And though I may fall still you make all things new
You speak, the storm, it obeys and gone is the weight of mistakes and
Though I still feel you continue to heal, look close, and see (whoa)

I am so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am
Not here by mistake
No luck, only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am (not who I was), I am (forgiven and loved)
I am (healed by your blood), I am (yes)
Thank God I am (still being changed)
I am (help me say), I am

How do you do?
I am a winner (it wasn't easy)
I've lost a few and life's knocked me to my knees
But now I am standing (hallelujah)
Not by my power, but your life inside of me
(just like you, I've gone through)
Even through seasons and changes (no tear)
No tear has ever been wasted
Misunderstood still it worked for my good
Look now and see
(I am not the old me but still)

I am (I am) so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am (don't forget you're)
Not here by mistake (yes)
No luck, only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am (now called your son), I am (forgiven for what I've done)
I am (forgiven for what I've done), I am (yes)
Thank God I am (sealed by your grace)
I am (still here, help me say), I am

Come on
Here I am closer, praise now is stronger
Stood up to fear, I think I'm still here
Couldn't walk away, love said not today
Times haven't seen what God has for me
The hurt and the lies, through the pain, through the night
Cried and I cried, but still I survived

I am so far from perfect
I thought life was worthless (yes God)
Until you showed me who I am (I am)
Not here by mistake
No luck, only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am (and all of you), I am (I'm in love with you)
I am (here to worship you), I am (Jesus)
Thank God I am (ready to be closer)
I am (ready to go higher), I am

I am so far from perfect (so far)
I thought life was worthless (yes)
Until you showed me who I am (but you showed me)
Not here by mistake (thank you)
No luck, only grace (thank you)
On my way toWho I am (I'm not ashamed)
I am (look, I'm not the same)
I am (letting go of the pain), I am (yes Lord)
Thank God I am (more than what you see)
I am (not yet what I shall be), I am

Oh thank you
You didn't give up on me while I was still in the process
Hallelujah God that you could see what I couldn't see
Thank you",I Am

Depression and unemployment
This song's for you

I know God is working so I smile

Now we are never alone
Your blood it makes us strong
Now there is power to move on
Never, we are never alone

Once I had a heart that just wouldn't seem to heal
No joy blowing through the wind
You're touch I couldn't feel
Near my ear I heard your voice
Speaking comfort to my soul
Saying when you're weak that's when I am strong
Now I am so glad I know

No more loneliness
No more cloudy days 
No more crying in the midnight 
Or the fears that just won't fade 
No more loneliness
No more skies that all seem gray
For I am resting in your blood stained hands

Though I may fall
I hear your call telling me
That I am free, free indeed

You’ll hold me close and
Tell me I’m over come and
You will exchange 
Joy for my pain
And I’ll praise your name Jesus

Kirk Franklin,"I'm losing my religion
Thank God
I prayed about my decision
How odd
For the man with the mic
To be the man all his life
While Christ-like stipes did with REM
Rev up the RPMs
How do I begin to try to paint this sin, of rules?
That divides God's people in two

In the beginning, religion created a mask
The reformation helped but soon the patch didn't last
I don't tell, you don't ask
So we created a lie
And for generations, church was where we went to go hide
Or we no longer tried
Because rules read our relationship was empty inside
Leaves you bitter, dry
Swift to cut like a razor
Swift to call you a traitor
'Cause you're swift to love Taylor
Now we got bad blood with our neighbor

Who's wrong, who's right
Every Sunday we're divided
Who's black, who's white, C'mon
Now the man in the mirror never gets race right
He'll never be Christ-like
Never receive good pay
So your faith never rises above minimum wage
So when it's time to save the world
You don't know what to say
To your brother that you love when he tells you he's gay
Do you push him away?
Judge him down till he leaves?
Give him a gospel he hears or a gospel he sees
Love wrapped in truth is the gospel he needs
There's room at the cross for everyone, even me

Well, my sins are now clean
The loss now redeemed
Religion is a prison but truth sets us free
Helps us believe
That the world we're in now is not the world that will be
Terror, famine, disease
Millions in poverty
Hungry, can't sleep
With all of this religion, why these babies can't eat?
And if the middle class is gone, how can America see?
How can America breathe?
When the oxygen is gone from the American dream
And these American streets listen close as they speak
The next time you think America please include me

Help the ones that are weak
All they want is a piece
Of the pie that you keep
Is that too much to ask of those who lay the concrete?
Still laying on concrete
Pop, pop by police
See, they the foundation of the nation
Not the 2%
Not the ones that own the building that the middle class rent
Because they make sense

Tell me how do you feel?
I'm the new Franklin and I have the new deal
I fight and do right
FDR for real
One nation under God
God, show us the way
The science of opinion
God is not a buffet
You pick what you want so no God on your plate
The preacher isn't God
Religion's first mistake
Serving stewards, shepherds, not kings
Has to die to his flesh everyday like me

One VIP
All the other seats in church are free
We're just groupies
God's the celebrity
Before 313 AD
Before Constantine
Before the council of Nacia
Before Romans and Greeks
Before Kalvin Alexander, Luther
Before let there be
Before history
To the last century
Before the death on the tree
Before the fall of man
Was a picture of me
Now to his heart
Right before the last three
Words he would speak
It is finished

It happened the moment, when you were revealed

Thinking 'bout the first time I heard Your voice
It wiped away my past
If anyone could tell, this kind of love has gotta last

So ta ta Jesus, thank You
I wanna ta ta You Jesus, thank You
I wanna ta ta You Jesus, thank You
For being mine, mine, mine

Remembering when I didn't know the Savior
How I wish that He was mine
(So you know what)
I had a little talk with the man upstairs
And I said won't you please come inside

So ta ta Jesus, thank You
I wanna ta ta You Jesus, thank You
I wanna ta ta You Jesus, thank You
For being mine, mine, mine

Ain't no love in the whole wide world for me but You, You, it's You
Help them understand, Lord, You're making me a man now, girl
Your love, Your love, love, is so true, so true
So true, so true, so true, so true, so true

So ta ta Jesus, thank You
I wanna ta ta You Jesus, thank You

I wanna ta ta You,  I got to thank You for 34 years on earth
I wanna ta ta You, for being mine, mine, mine
Come on and get off your feet if the Lord has been good to You

Kirk Whalum,"I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song

Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly

Kirk Whalum,"Daddy waited up, in the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said, ""Son I know you live here
But this is still my home
It's my way or the highway""
So I said alright, ""I'm gone""

And before I slammed that door
I said, ""I hate you""
But he just shook his head, and said ok

But you can't stop my love for you
It'll be here that's a given
As long as I am living on this earth
One thing is true
You will turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let you go
Son always know, my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowing turning on itself
And girl it took losing you 
To finally know how daddy felt
But we stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin' on to pride and anger
As we threw our love away

And before you slammed that door
You said, ""I hate you""
But tonight if only you could hear me say

That you can't stop my love for you
It'll be here that's a given
As long as I am living on this earth
One thing is true
You will turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let you go

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Kirk Whalum,"In a magical time, in a mystical place
He and she crossed paths
Their native tongues foreign to each other, they are not

Underscored with melody of innocence
They are children unaware of the impure
Able to communicate, able to take each others breathe

Without words, placed in a mesmerizing trance
With a dance of melody
Whalum wails in a whisper
Translating light, peace, joy, hope
There's something about that horn

The beautiful air soaked with freedom to be
Liberating the spirit to embrace difference
He speaks, she speaks, they listen to unknown, unfamiliar dialog
Completely familiar with each other
He takes hold of her soul, she takes hold of his soul

Within the quickest moment a lifetime has passed
Now begun the sun shining from that horn
Heals them both who have been scorned
Now adorned with jewels of wisdom
There's something about that horn
Whalum wails in a whisper

Through there mental temple blows a gentle breeze
Of hearing, really listening to what is being felt and said
Can that simply be the miracle of simplicity?
Listening, hearing, understanding
Even if you don't agree, agree to be cool

Something old school and yet something new is unfolding
Love always there, just being rediscovered
Melody always there, just had to find it again

Something old school and yet something new is unfolding
Holding the most timeless wibe
Like that horn on this groove, move, oh yeah

Oh, that's what's happening, they're moving each other
And brother it's hot, but it's not what you think
He is community, she is state, they are nations

This music speaks in a language only the spirit can comprehend
And make a mense, praying to walk on water
Breathe easy, calm air

He is beauty, she is strength, they are power
He is earth, she is fire, she is belief, he is culture
They are every color
He is harmony, she is melody, they are music

There's something about that horn
Whalum wails in a whisper
There's something, something about that horn
Oh yeah, that horn is love

Whalum wails in a whisper
Whalum wails in a whisper

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Next time I'll get it so right

I gave all the trust I had 
Ever could, ever will 
We all mistake deceit for grace 
Get it all thrown back in our face

People rushing by 
Finding reason for flight

Under my feet 
Nearly found myself wishing 
You were there 
Reaching out for me 
Waiting for the breeze 
Waiting for the breeze 
And the world of life 
Goes by everyday 
The city fell in silence 
As I began to pray 
I wish you well 
I hope you're safe 
I hope you're stretched out 
A million miles high 
Running down narrow streets

Thinking all I want 
All I need 
People pass me by 
But I feel like the only one 
Stars in the scarce low light of winter 
I could leave again 
Lock into that big one 
Escape to open places 
But I won't undermine 
The truth may come home 
Through the windows in the wall

City banker looks are in
The heartless heart, the chinless chin
And you'd spill your beans for just a pint of gin
How you got so holy
And became so thin

The tacky photos and the phoney smiles

I couldn't hear him in my own backyard

He may have held my hand
When we were walking down the street
He talked about all kinds of things
But none of them were him and me

Just as an airplane roared above
Said something about football

I never heard him all the times he yelled
I never heard him if he tried to tell me

I would like the court to note

Darling
While the firelight is low
I'm disappearing
Like the last day of the snow
And really, it's better this way
We both know it's over
And we'll never pass this way again

Sunshine and the desert call to me
And you know moonshine
Makes you blind so you can't see at all
But whatever you feel
It may not be real
And baby we'll never pass this way again

I'm not the only love you'll ever know
Look to your stars above and wish it so
Let me go

Darling
If I stay too long you'll tire of me
'cause darling, that's the way we are designed to be
So, hard as it is to say
We had the night and we had our day
We'll never pass this way again

Kirsty MacColl,"I was twenty one years when I wrote this song
I'm twenty two now, but I won't be for long
People ask when will you grow up to be a man
But all the girls I loved at school
Are already pushing prams

I loved you then as I love you still
Tho I put you on a pedestal,
They put you on the pill
I don't feel bad about letting you go
I just feel sad about letting you know

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl
I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl

I loved the words you wrote to me
But that was bloody yesterday
I can't survive on what you send
Every time you need a friend

I saw two shooting stars last night
I wished on them but they were only satellites
Is it wrong to wish on space hardware
I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care

I don't want to change the world

Kirsty MacColl,"(kirsty maccoll)
You've been around for such a long time now
Or maybe I could leave you but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely every night
When I can be with you, oh yes you make it right

And I don't listen to the guys who say
That you're bad for me and I should turn you away
Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love

I get a feeling when I look at you
Wherever you go now I want to be there too
They say we're crazy but I just don't care
And if they keep on talkin' still they get nowhere

So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you and you hold my hand
Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love

Why should it matter to us if they don't approve
We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose

Baby
There's no need for living in the past
Now I found good loving gonna make it last
I tell the others don't bother me
Cause when they look at you they don't see what I see

No I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs
But they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love

Another baby on the way 
A dreamboy for your nightmare nights 
Who never shouts and never fights 
Happy with your 2.2 
What else is there for you to do 
But turn and wet the baby's head 
And pray he will be happier than you or me? 
That's how it's meant to be 
It's called a lifetime 
At first you never notice 
Then the years go flying by and I say 
Tread lightly in your dreams 
They might come true for you tomorrow 
 
Say sorry to the boys and girls 
You're sorry for this bloody world 
Sorry for the sick and old 
And sorry for the lies you told 
Sorry for the things I did 
The thighs we should have left unsaid 
And walked away instead of 
Rubbing salt on all those open sores and wounds 
We should have left to heal 
I never knew just what to feel or to expect 
I tried to stretch my mind but I'd just 
Get my body wrecked and now I 
Tread lightly in my dreams 
They might come true tomorrow 
And I don't sleep at night in case 
I don't wake up tomorrow 
I curse the day I met you 
But I won't forget you 
Not in my lifetime 

Another time, another day 
You'd never give your heart away 
You'd never think and never cry 
You'd look the devil in the eye 
And tell him to be gone, bye bye 
He'll never get you in this lifetime 
He'd love to touch you but his hands are tied

With your mohair suits and foreign shoes

And now I'm lying here alone
'Cause you're out there on the phone
To some star in New York
I can hear you laughing now
And I can't help feeling that somehow

Could make the coldness go away

Oh, innocence has passed you by a long, long time ago
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know
Your pornographic priestess left you for another guy
You frighten little children and you always wonder why
Always wonder why

The mercury is rising and it's not all that surprising
In the land of milk and honey where you make big money
And it always keeps the rain off and it always keeps you dry
But back home the people hate you and you never did know why

But I think I'm going to tell you
Just give me fifty thousand lire for my thoughts

Oh, innocence has passed you by a long, long time ago
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know
The supermarket checkout girl once smacked you in the eye
When you eat no one else does but you always wonder why
Always wonder why

It would take a gunshot just to clear your head awhile
And after all this time how can you stand there
Look at me and smile?

Now are you just waving or drowning?
It's so hard to tell when you're so far away

Oh, innocence has passed you by a long, long time ago
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know
Degeneration suits you, now I'm going home to cry
You won't be seeing me again but you'll always wonder why
Always wonder why

She called me up the other day
And left a message on my machine
She called to say you broke her heart
And she'd wondered if I'd seen you
I didn't know what to do, I never called her back

Don't want to see her face when she finds out you're mine
Can't look in her eyes and tell her love is blind
Now I don't want to see caroline

How can I want you so bad
She has to lose again
How could you walk out on her
And turn to her best friend
It was wrong from the start
I wish I'd turned you away
And my head said go, but my heart, my heart said stay

And now I don't want to see caroline
Don't want to see her cry when she knows you're mine
Can't look in those eyes and tell her she'll be fine
Now I don't want to see caroline
I don't want to see caroline

I'm so ashamed of myself that I still want you
What a terrible thing for a friend to do

I think I've gone too far this time
I leapt across that thin blue line
God help this selfish heart of mine
Now I don't want to see caroline
I can never face caroline

Now I lie here with you, can't get her out my head
Do you think she knows that you share my bed
Well I don't want to see caroline
Don't want to see her face when she finds out you're mine
How could a friend be so unkind

Could I make you feel better?

And to die is a reliable exit
So you push it and you test it

Kirsty MacColl,"He was just a friend of mine
I'd run in to from time to time
And long before he moved away
We used to share a taste for wine

Still I never knew that he was sad back then
He said, the time had come, for him, to take a holiday

And he says it's brilliant there
There's something in the air
And sunshine everywhere
He's on the beach

I know he's changed somehow, he sends us postcards now
I'm not sure where he is, but he is out of reach

When he called me up one day
And said that he was going away
I thought he meant a week in France
And not 12,000 miles to Sydney Bay

Still he had to take his chances
He said, the time had come for him to make a move away

And he says it's brilliant there
There's something in the air
And sunshine everywhere
He's on the beach

I know he's changed somehow, he writes us postcards now
He's on his own again and he is out of reach
(I bet he gets it on the beach)

And I don't blame him
Leaving was the best thing he could do
He longed for changes
I just hope he's happy when he does the things he thinks he has to do

And he tries, and he tries, yes he tries
But he's a little bit hard on himself
So now he's trying to be someone else

And he says, he says, he says it's brilliant there
There's something in the air
And sunshine everywhere
He's on the beach

I know he's changed somehow, it's in his postcards now
He's on his own again, so far out of reach

And underneath the bridge where we first kissed

The poisoned river waters flow
And then they're gone
For some of us still life moves on

Our love is just a relic of the past
You'd never recognise the old town now
Somewhere behind the concrete and the glass
The monuments of england's sacred cow
Where are all the human beings?

How can you lie there and think of England

I've camped by the Waynestones as well
I've sunbathed on Kinder, been burned to a cinder
And many more things I can tell
My rucksack has oft been me pillow
The heather has oft been me bed
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

Ch:     I'm a rambler, I'm a rambler from Manchester way
        I get all me pleasure the hard moorland way
        I may be a wageslave on Monday
        But I am a free man on Sunday

The day was just ending and I was descending
Down Grinesbrook just by Upper Tor
When a voice cried ""Hey you"" in the way keepers do
He'd the worst face that ever I saw
The things that he said were unpleasant
In the teeth of his fury I said
""Sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead""

He called me a louse and said ""Think of the grouse""
Well i thought, but I still couldn't see
Why all Kinder Scout and the moors roundabout
Couldn't take both the poor grouse and me
He said ""All this land is my master's""
At that I stood shaking my head
No man has the right to own mountains
Any more than the deep ocean bed

I once loved a maid, a spot welder by trade
She was fair as the Rowan in bloom
And the bloom of her eye watched the blue Moreland sky
I wooed her from April to June
On the day that we should have been married
I went for a ramble instead
For sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

So I'll walk where I will over mountain and hill
And I'll lie where the bracken is deep
I belong to the mountains, the clear running fountains
Where the grey rocks lie ragged and steep
I've seen the white hare in the gullys
And the curlew fly high overhead
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead.",The Manchester Rambler

Kirsty MacColl,"When I was just a child 
My folks would drive me wild 
They'd spy upon my every move 
Until it drove me to despair 
They told me what to wear 
They told me not to cut my hair 
But that's all over now 
I had to tell them anyhow 

It's my affair 
Where I go and what I do 
It's my affair oh yeah 
It's my affair 
It's up to me and not to you 
It's my affair 

That's the way I want to keep it 
I kissed the boy in secret 
Thrilled me to the very core 
I couldn't stop I wanted more and 
I didn't hear the door and 
They caught me on the floor 
With my affair 

And when we first got wed 
We used to stay in bed 
All day and night all night and day 
We bedded half our lives away 
But that's all over now 
We move in higher circles 
Chomping through the upper crust 
I couldn't see you for the dust 
And then you met that girl 
Who left you with your money spent 
And now it's no concern of yours 
If I sleep with the President 

It's my affair 
And if I don't come home tonight 
It's my affair alright 
It's my affair 
Who I see is up to me 
It's my affair 

That's how I want to keep it 
I kiss the boys in secret 
Hiding in the parking lot 
Is just as far as I have got but 
If the phone should ring and 
There's no one there 
Then it's my affair 

Eso es asunto de ella 
Donde va why lo que hare 

Well it's all over now 
You've seen the last of me 
And I don't have to put up with you 
Giving me the third degree 
So you go on your way 
And don't come sneaking round the back door 
Trying to get yourself",My Affair [Japanese-only Bonus Track]

And she reaches for the tin where she keeps important things

Across the desert to the bright shiny city by the sea

Another day, now his words have worn away
And his face, well she can't quite remember
And she sighs with remorse, all her dreams are flying north
Where they wear fancy clothes, painted nails and long blonde hair
And where they fly across the jungle
Across the desert to the bright shiny city by the sea

He lives in a high rise block
And here I am
He shouldn't have turned my rock
He's brushing his teeth
He doesn't look bad from this far
I'm hailing a cab
And I'm gonna follow his car
Wherever he goes
I won't be too far behind
Just hanging around
Driving him out of his mind

I'm stalking a fan
He used to write all the time
How lovely I am
He really made me feel fine
But how they forget
He needed a wake-up call
And he will regret
Having been so shallow
He made me believe
That I was some kind of myth
So here I am
How could he treat me like this?

To buy a cd
By some other girl not me

Getting her out of her box
And putting her on
And dancing around in his socks

But I know he'll thank me when he wakes up

Kirsty MacColl,"I feel empty, I feel deceived
You shouldn't have done that to me
I was fine till you came along
I'd grown used to being alone
But you made love to me and then
I hoped it might happen again
And now you tell me you love someone else
And that life's too complicated
And you throw me a cliché like ""we'll still be friends""
Well mister, you're wrong again

Cause my friends are people who love me
Not like you, not like you
And they try to take good care of me
They wouldn't hurt me like you do
Will I ever get smart, once again I'm the fool
To let you be so unnecessarily cruel

And now you tell me you love someone else
I was just light entertainment
Did you think you would cause me no pain?
Wrong again, wrong again

I thought my karma might protect me
From any harm you might subject me to
That my heart could be ruled by my brain
Wrong again
So you took a little piece of me
Laid me open for the world to see
But if I meant so little to you
Why couldn't you just leave me be?
It wouldn't have made so much difference to you
But it meant the whole world to me

And now you tell me you love someone else
You were thinking of her all along
So you thought my intentions were roughly the same
Wrong again, wrong again

I might not have minded if I'd been prepared
I wouldn't have felt such rejection
But your heart's not as free as you promised me
And you've realised on closer inspection

So now you tell me you love someone else
You were thinking of her all along
You assumed that I knew all the rules of the game
Wrong again, wrong again

Kirsty MacColl,"Sometimes it's hard to remember you lied
And memory fades as the years pass you by
Sometimes the truth's got up, lay down and died
But I can't forget all the tears that I cried

Sometimes I try to pretend it's alright
The promises I make last nearly all night
Still in the morning I run and I hide
'cause I can't forget all the tears that I cried

But I'll get fooled like the last time
Oh how these eyes are sore
They'll cry again just like before

Lonely the track I decided to take
Lost from the start all the friendships I make
Single fares only the trails only I ride
'cause I can't forget all the tears that I cried

Too much reminiscing is bad for the soul
It screws up your life and it makes you feel old
Don't want to remember what I can't abide
'cause I can't forget all the tears that I cried

But I'll get fooled like the last time
Oh how these eyes are sore
They'll cry again just like before

I find it so hard just to make up my mind
You've all been so patient and all been so kind
But when it comes to emotions my outbursts are tied
'cause I can't forget all the tears that I cried

But I'll get fooled like the last time
Oh how these eyes are sore
They'll cry again just like before

'cause I can't forget all the tears
I can't forget all the tears

I can't forget all the tears

Kirsty MacColl,"In more street where I did dwell
A butcher boy I loved right well
He courted me my life away
And now with me he will not stay

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
I wish I was a maid again
But a maid again I'll never be
Till cherries grow on an apple tree

I wish my baby it was born
And smiling on it's daddy's knee
And me poor girl to be dead and gone
With the long green grass growing over me

He went upstairs and the door he broke
He found her hanging from a rope
He took his knife and he cut her down
And in her pocket these words he found

""oh make my grave large, wide and deep
Put a marble stone at my head and feet
And in the middle a turtle dove
So the world may know I died of love""

And playing my guitar
And all the time I'm strumming
I'm wondering where you are
Oh yes I know it's over
I know I shouldn't care
But I can't get away from you
It seems you're always there

How come I don't see you anymore?
How come we lost the magic touch?
Why can't I pick up the telephone
When I want to call you so much?
Who's going to make me forget you
And get you off my mind?
I could be out breaking other people's hearts
If you weren't still breaking mine

The winter's drawing in again
Another year has passed
Now I think of things I meant to say
But the time went by so fast
I hear you're living in new york these days
And you don't come here any more
I keep asking myself so many questions
But lately I wonder what I'm wondering for

Who's going to make me forget you
And get you off my mind?
I could be out breaking other people's hearts
If you weren't still breaking mine

I let you pass me by
I never tried too hard
Though you'll never see me cry
You really made your mark

How come I don't see you anymore?
How come we lost the magic touch?
And why can't I pick up the telephone
When I want to hear your voice so much?
Who's going to make me forget you
And get you off my mind?
I could be out breaking other people's hearts
If you weren't
If you weren't still breaking mine

Stop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night
It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me

Feels so good tonight, who cares about tomorrow

I went to a party, just so smartly, cool as cool could be
I knew I could make it, knew I could shake it, lose some fancy free
So I went to the table and reached for a bottle

Took a few sips and looked around, I was feelin' fine

Then you started to move with such a groove, stronger than sneakin' slow

So without a word, and like some bird, we flew to another place
And pretty soon we were in some room stretched miles out in space
The room was turnin', we were burnin', things became a haze

Go to the park and space our heads out
We called it fun but there was some doubt

If they knew her, how she hides it away 
Locked inside, there's the start of a flame 
And the feelings that she never will tame 

Ooh as she's walking around like a mystery 
Ooh there's a woman that nobody sees livin' inside 

[Chorus:]
Thrills in the night, far from the light, passion taking over 
Prices she pays, all through the days, no on really knows her 

In the evening when she takes to the street 
She goes hunting with a body in heat 
And desires she's kept hidden inside make her tingle 
And she knows why she lies 

Ooh as she's walking around like a mystery 
Ooh there's a woman that nobody sees living inside 

Thrills in the night, far from the light, passion taking over 
Prices she pays, all through the days, no on really knows her 

Thrills in the night, far from the light, passion taking over 
Prices she pays, all through the days, no on really knows her 

See the stranger that she's pushing away 
As she dresses for the start of a day 
And desires she's kept hidden inside make her tingle 
Yeah she knows why she lies 

Thrills in the night, far from the light, passion taking over 
Prices she pays, all through the days, no on really knows her",Thrills in the Night

Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever - yeah!

I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive

Keep hope alive yes deep inside and your dreams will never die

And then you realize they've brought you back to life again
Something's never change but if you fantasize
You'll feel it deep inside yourself and then you'll realize

When you feel it coming
When you hear the sound
You'll always laugh when you want to cry
And then you'll know it deep inside

Kiss,"Like a blade of a sword I am forged in flame 
Fiery hot 
Tempered steel fire-bright to the night I take 
I fear not 
Now compelled by something I cannot see 
I go forth surrendering to history 

Your glory, I swear I ride for thee 
Your power, I trust it rides with me 
Your servant, I am and ever shall I be 

Through a dream 
I have a come to an ancient door 
Lost in the mist 
I have been there a hundred times or more 
Pounding my fists 
Now inside, the fire of the ancient burns 
A boy goes in and suddenly a man returns 

Your glory, I swear I ride for thee 
Your power, I trust it rides with me 
Your servant, I am and ever shall I be 

I gave my word and gained a key 
I gave my heart and set it free 
There's no turning back from this odyssey 
Because I feel so alive suddenly 
And I wonder, is this really me?

I made you breakfast but you would not eat. so I took your black dress off and washed you clean.

You're thick as porcelain
As clear as cellophane.

And miss the way it hurt
The way it killed to think that I had You first...

So then I force a smile
I take the stage
Now my knees are weak try to concentrate
I'm loosing air with every single breathe that I take..
I look into your eyes
See the chemicals, you're the whitest white
You've become a ghost
You're dead to me so why can't I let you go?

I drive into my ear
I had a love affair
With distance and with fear
The bus is like a hearse
Driving me from her
She's as black as white
She the perfect curse
She's the perfect curse

And if you saved my life, how could I survive, you're the one that made me

Warm as a summer day

But your will is as strong as concrete

Runs through my head to make stories.
Like letters wrote it stings like a cigarette burn.
Some things change and some things don't.
They're watered seeds that help us grow,
Its time for you to forget all that you've learned.

Smiles that take away eye sight,
The words that deafened me tonight.
(remeber when you told me I'd be good for her?)
We fell asleep, fell in love,
And woke up with a brand new scar.
All you have is right now,
Just stay who you are.

I've fallen on my feet,
I'm finally right here where I want to be.
With the world against me,
I'm right here.

When will we forget




",Reminder [Acoustic][*]

Reminds me of song I wrote two years back.
I remember each and every line,
Like a photo glued to the lids of my eyes.

The shiver of my wheezing chest, Reminds me of the way I felt two years back.
And as we lose all track of time,
I feel her breath like ice on the tip of my spine.

The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
Oh-oh-oh.

The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep.

I wait for the bed to get warm,
As my eyes adjust to the darkest light form.
And as I start to drift away,
You're the shake that pulls me back to this state.

The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
Oh-oh-oh.

Is I gave you all I have,
And you just left

Are the memories and the pain
Because now I sleep on blades
Just to stay awake

I think it's time you listen to what I say;
I don't care if it takes a million days
Toget this through
Another year is almost over
But I'm the one that's coming to an end

I'll never wake this far from you
And if I never sleep again
It will be too soon!

It can't get away and baby cried her eyes out
It's watching it change, it's somewhere in the house
It can't get away and baby cried her eyes out

There was a leak in the kitchen sink
The carpet was red, now it's faded pink
There was enough for the walls to drink

It's watching it change, it's somewhere in the house
It can't get away and baby cried her eyes out
It's watching it change, it's somewhere in the house
It can't get away and baby cried her eyes out

We are following the sheen

They'll break down doors.
Those shining pearls float off in space.

She had everything I'd need.

When I go to heaven and stand shivering before this god,
I'll try some complaining, ""why that little tiny trick?""

Give me the pearls of love, of wisdom and of smiles.
Give me another chance, a beautiful set of wings. 

In Heaven.

",When in Heaven
Kitchens of Distinction,"I think it's time to wake my friend
Invisible men with the forever grin
We do wrong but we do it together
He stops me of thinking of people to murder

I must keep it together
I hate to compromise
But when the felons are out feloning
He is a place to hide

And his laugh, it gets me through
Those troubled hours of men in suits
And his face, it gets a smile
Erases their skyscraper lies

I take him out to save my skin
When I can't last the evening
Dresses my lips with angel kiss
Under lemon moons and ice-cube licks

I must keep it together
I hate to compromise
But when the felons are out feloning
He is a place to hide

And his laugh...

Come on now, come on now, we can beat the storm

For your face a sacrifice
For your grace, a higher life
In the cave behind your eyes
Where we can climb and we light fires

We'll light fires

To a world of love
Do you want to come with us?

Stirring blood to rage

Gather the bruised and imperfected
The cursed and the rejected
We'll take them to our ship
We'll fly away from here
We'll take away our finery
Leave this place to rust.

As they watch the thin-lipped shaking
Lost their nerve, we've gone too far

Choked on diamonds

Slices the praisers, here come the swans

Terror all around, beauty can terrorize
Riot on fake-feathered friends, here killed the swans

Returned complete, sincerely yours, fully restored

But peace perfect peace

For love's like the sea
They're hungry gods with careless hands
That wrap themselves around our lives
So hard to resist
They swallowed me, you swallowed me
I closed my eyes, I disappeared

I won't stay around to be hurt by careless words

No, I suppose it's colder when you're dead

Kitchens of Distinction,"Hide him away from the backhand of angry
He'll sit quietly as the fizzyness flows around
Never seen wars before, never been to a party
He says ""they laugh like balloons, they dance like baboons
They're so different when it's dark""
Hiding away as the noise gets louder
Watching the people loose in the corridor
Too many questions
He can't stay long, this is not his world
""Why are their lips even redder than
The bad one in Snow White
Why do they shout so, are they in pain

Onto this broken-hearted hungry clown
Because he can't get his fill.

Never thought that he would ever
Want this much from a man,
But love is the steepest sharpest slide.  

Oh here he'd lie at your side 
Looking up into the sky
Wondering if this is allowed

But fear rules him easily 
It takes lust and strength 
To turn to you and say

""I want you and I need you""
But I haven't got the fattest chance in hell.

Sun has finally upped and gone 
Being bored of everyone.
I slip of my shirt and shoes.

Time to hate myself again
My small voice and freckled skin
Till the safety of the dark.

Looking up into your eyes
Wondering if this is allowed

And take us on these rides

I'll shut my epileptic eyes and 
Daydream of busy nights

I'll crush my arms around
Until I melt inside of you.

Draw me something, draw a line 
Connecting what we did to what happens now.
I don't understand how we changed
Not sure I'll ever know.

It's all circles, colliding spheres,
I closed off, chaos appears.

Once we were all smiles and plans, 
And dressing up to go
Playing outside playing cars,
Now it's all been tamed I yell.

Don't stop.  Don't leave me here.
Don't stop.  Won't get caught again.
You can't go.  There's no sense anymore.

A tap of tears and a veil of guilt taunt me now.
Growing growing growing gone,
Years pick up speed again.

Throw me pointers, no more jibes.
There's this ancient knot inside my chest,
It works its way into my throat,
Will not let these stories out.

Refusal works it always wins,
Too much thought, too few grins.

Free you say, free to roam,
but down below Father, Mother, always guiding,
pointing out a world I refuse to know.

Don't stop.  Don't stop, say it's all OK.
You say, ""Where's the ache of freedom?
Where's the devil's whispers?
This is the sweetest pain, run and run.
Jump up as far as you can, 
shake your head and breathe.""

Kitty Carlisle Hart,"Clothes must play a part 
To light an eye, to win a heart; 
They say a gown can almost speak, 
If it is chic. 
Should you select the right effect, 
You cannot miss, 
You may be sure, 
He will tell you this. 

Lovely to look at, 
Delightful to know and heaven to kiss. 
A combination like this, 
Is quite my most impossible scheme come true, 
Imagine finding a dream like you! 
You're lovely to look at, 
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight. 
For we're together, the moon is new, 
And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight! 

What appeals to me 
Is just your charm and dignity,
Not what you wear, 
But just an air, of great repose. 
You are quite perfect from your head down to your toes 
Both night and day, 
I am moved to say.

Kitty Carlisle Hart,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture
Kitty Carlisle Hart,"I wonder what he'll think of me
I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Every other feller's father
Well, I can!
I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his puddin-headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrestle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill!

Bill, my boy Bill
I will see that he is named after me, I will.
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

I don't give a hang what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack.

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well.

Aha-ha-ha-ha!
He might be a champ of the heavyweights,
Or a feller that sells you glue,
Or President of the United States,
That'd be all right, too
His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President if he didn't wanna be!
Not Bill!

My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And as tough as a tree, will Bill
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss him or toss him around!
No fat-bottomed, flabby-faced,
Pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

And I'm hanged if he'll marry his boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnette...

Hey, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!
I can see him when he's seventeen or so,
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him
Wait a minute!
Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money!
You can have fun with a son
But you gotta be a father to a girl
She mightn't be so bad at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair!
A kind o' sweet and petite
Little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!

My little girl
Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad
She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two or three
But my little girl
Gets hungry every night and she comes home to me!

I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
In a fair hand dressed
In the best that money can buy!
I never knew how to get money,
But, I'll try, I'll try! I'll try!
I'll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die!",Strange Music (Nocturne and Wedding Day in Troldhaugen)

An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.",Nobody's Child
Kitty Margolis,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Kitty Margolis,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Kitty Margolis,"Thousands of years before history recorded
Deep in the jungle, a woman stepped on wet clay
And the print remained there
Future reminder of ages ago

Many lives later a traveler crossed the same path
Under the vines he saw traces of that footprint
Silent testimony
Spiritual journey begun long ago

Eons of changes, illusion of some progress
Fearfulness leading us further from the soul power
Known in early ages
When nature’s heartbeat rang loud on the earth

The key to our freedom lies not just in our thinking
The ancient intuition that’s buried deep within us
Is waiting to be set free
The creator’s gift to her children must flow

We call on the past now to show us where to go
We’re closer to then than we may want to show
We’re closer to then than we may really know
Footprints, ancient footprints

",Ancient Footprints
Kitty Margolis,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned

Kitty Margolis,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

Kitty Margolis,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Kitty Margolis,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings

When I drive them high steppin' strutters.

With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,

When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top! 
When we hit that road, hell fer leather, 
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather, 
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop! 
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along, 
The cows'll moo in the clover, 
The river will ripple out a whispered song, 
And whisper it over and over: 
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever? 
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever? 
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop 
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

When we drive back home in the surrey, 
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top! 
I can feel the day gettin' older, 
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder, 
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop! 
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill; 
The moon is takin' a header, 
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still, 
A lark'll wake up in the medder. 
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'! 
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin' 
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.

Will you hear that whistle blowing?
Will you be there at your seat?

Has your ticket yet been purchased

Oh, will you ride? Oh, will you ride?
Will you ride that train to glory by and by?

All the headlights will be gleaming, Jesus is the engineer
Will you ride this train to glory or will you be waiting here
When these golden bells start ringing? When he calls us all aboard
Will you have your ticket ready for your Savior and your Lord?

Has your ticket yet been purchased

The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trustful wife

It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong

It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start
Most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame

Now I know you're having fun and holding hand
I knew tonight when you never came around
That you had left me on the lonely side of town

Thought the life they live up there has lured your heart
To where they dance and slip around till after dark

It once made me happy but now it makes me blue
There's something about Christmas that starts me missing you
No I don't have the spirit as before no Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore

This lonely house don't need no mistletoes for I'm the only one that comes and goes
And since that day you walked out the door well Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
It once made me happy...

I CAN'T TELL MY HEART THAT I CAN'T TELL MY HEART, THAT YOU ARE NO GOOD, I'D GIVE THIS WORLD, IF ONLY I COULD, YOU CHEATED AND LIED, AND YOU LEFT ME FLAT, I KNOW IT'S TRUE, BUT I CAN'T TELL MY HEART THAT. OH MY FOOLISH HEART, WHY WON'T YOU BELIEVE, THAT SOME ONE IS GONE, IT'S NO USE TO GRIEVE, STILL PINING FOR SOME ONE, WHO WILL NEVER COME BACK, I KNOW IT'S TRUE, BUT I CAN'T TELL MY HEART THAT. I CAN'T TELL MY HEART, THAT YOU ARE NO GOOD, I'D GIVE THIS WORLD, IF ONLY I COULD, YOU CHEATED AND LIED, AND YOU LEFT ME FLAT, YES IT'S TRUE, BUT I CAN'T TELL MY HEART THAT. MY HEART STILL CRIES OUT, IT WASN'T LONG AGO, THAT WE WERE TOGETHER, YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME SO, SOMEWHERE OUT THERE, IT DON'T MATTER WHERE AT, TO YOU I'M FORGOTTEN, BUT I CAN'T TELL MY HEART THAT.

",I Can't Tell My Heart That
Kitty Wells,"Make believe that we're happy make believe that we're happy
Just pretend that it's true just pretend that it's true
Make believe you have me I'll make believe I have you
We'll make believe till we can make it come true

You belong to another you belong to another
I belong to someone too I belong to someone too
But they can't seem to see that our love just has to be
We'll make believe till we can make it come true
[ fiddle - steel ]
Maybe someday up above maybe someday up above
We'll understand our kind of love we'll understand our kind of love
We know a love like ours is real I know just the way you feel
We'll make believe till we can make it come true
Make believe that we're happy...




",Make Believe ('Til We Can Make It Come True)
Kitty Wells,"Now when I'm by myself dear who do I want near
Who no one but you
Now when I want some loving some old fashioned hugging
It's you no one but you

You've got me talking my sleep sometimes even I can't eat
My heart don't beat the way it used to you
You've got me rocking and reeling honey I've got a funny feeling
Over you no one but you

Now when I got to sleep at night I wonder if you're home alright
You I'm thinking of you
Now you're my only baby and you're driving me crazy
You I'm thinking of you

I hope the time's not far away we can plan our wedding day
And then I'll have you for my very own
I'm not plannin' to be hasty but maybe someday baby
I'll have you no one but you",No One But You
Kitty Wells,"All these many years I've loved you
No one has ever known,
No one has ever known but you alone.
I've kept it locked inside my heart
And smiled through all my tears,
My darling I have loved you,
Oh so many years.

Each night within my lonely room
I cried dear over you,
And prayed to God that things would turn out right.
But when the dawn of day appears
I brush away my tears,
My darling I have loved you,
Oh so many years.

I'll go on pretending that my life is all so gay,
And happy dear without you by my side,
When all the time my heart is longing
Just to have you near,
My darling I have loved you,
Oh so many years.

Maybe fate will lead us down a path
Where we will meet again,
And then we'll both be free to love anew.
Then one sweet kiss from your dear lips
Will banish all my fears,
My darling I have loved you,
Oh so many years.","Oh, So Many Years"
Kitty Wells,"One by one we've broke each vow we made
It was you who lied it was me who paid
As sure as there's a heaven beyond the sun we'll pay for our lies one by one
My plans and hopes have tumbled down my castle of dreams plunged to the ground

How can you face me after what you've done
You've shattered my dreams one by one
One by one...

How can you go to sleep at night don't know mem'ries make you long for daylight
You'll pay the price after having your fun you'll regret each mistake one by one
The love I treasured you sold for gold and then you left me cold
You're happy now but the time will come your false love will lead you one by one
One by one...",One by One
Kitty Wells,"One week later oh how I cried
Just one week later I wish I could die
You were so sure you could forget me
You didn't want me by your side

When someone new came and took you
I thought I would be glad to say goodbye
One week later I hurt deep inside
One week later my tears I couldn't hide
One week later oh how I cried

Yes one week later I wish I could die
I prayed for god to forgive me
Yes you broke a heart true as good
But now I relived every moment
We'll regret it until we grow old

One week later I hurt deep inside
One week later my tears I couldn't hide
One week later oh how I cried
Yes one week later I wish I could die",One Week Later
Kitty Wells,"'Cause we stuck together through the lean lean years
The lean and hungry years were filled with strife
Now we're still together in the green green years
And we'll still together for the rest of our life

I've seen love come and gone just like the winter's snow
I saw a boy break his darling's heart
But his love wasn't true like my live is for you
And darling I will never break your heart
'Cause we stuck together...

At first it was so hard for us to make a start but we kept on trying every day
Your kisses were so sweet and you were nice to me
And darling you slipped me off my feet
'Cause we stuck together...",We'll Stick Together
Kitty Wells,"You and me together life's a pleasure
But without your love I'd want to flee
And I feel the same about you darling
We belong together you and me
We'll share loves' joy and life's sorrow
You belong to me I belong to you
When you hold my hand 
The sun shines brighter
When you smile at me, I lose my blues
Don't ever let nothing come between us
Think how lonely life apart would be
Gossiping tongues can never change me darling
Your love means more than life to me",You and Me
Kitty Wells,"How far is heaven, let's go to-night
I want my daddy to hold me tight.

A little girl was waiting for her daddy one day
It was time to meet him, when she heard her mommy say
Come to mama, darling, please do not cry
Daddy's gone to heaven, way up in the sky.

How far Is Heaven, when can I go
To see my daddy, he's there, I know
How far Is Heaven, let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight.

He was called so suddenly and could not say goodbye
I know that he's in heaven, we'll meet him by and by
The little girl trembled, her tears she could not hide
She looked up towards heaven and then she replied.

How far Is Heaven, when can I go
To see my daddy, he's there, I know
How far Is Heaven, let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight.",How Far Is Heaven
Kitty Wells,"You see her there at the bar cross the room
She looks like an angel with her paint and perfume
You'd like to meet her your conscience says no
Obey your conscience turn around boy and go

She's no angel she's no angel her wings are not real
She'll ruin your life it's your heart she can steal
She'll tell you tales to bring tears to your eyes
So don't you believe them for they're only lies

You think if only she could your own
You'd be more contented than a king on his throne
You'd better not trust her it's wrong if you'd do

She's broken many hearts and she'll break your too
She's no angel she's no angel...",She's No Angel
Kitty Wells,"Your lawyer called today, and said he had the papers all prepared.
And to sign my name was all I had to do.
He seen the Judge now he seen me,there's only one thing left
Will your lawyer talk to God for you?
Will your lawyer talk to god and plead your case upon high
And defend the way you broke my heart in two
Man made laws to set you free on earth but is God satisfied
Will your lawyer talk to God for you

Music is played
We all face the final judgment, and it's very strict they say
When your time comes, I wonder what you'll do
Will you bow your head in shame? or turn your head away
Will your lawyer talk to God for you",Will Your Lawyer Talk to God?
