    "I ran across a repo on Github with someone's data that had already been scraped from AZLyrics. The files were 'mostly' in alphabetical order, but not completely. There were also several files missing (there were no band names after 'T'). It still managed to be a significant source for lyrics! (Here's the link to the repo: https://github.com/SoumitraAgarwal/Webscraping-Text-Data).\n",
    "\n",
    "AZLyrics has lyrics for bands that aren't on Genius, so I'd been looking for ways to scrape the data. ~~After downloading all the files into one folder, I tried to load them all at once to a df. That didn't work since I got an error saying that some of the files were corrupt. So I figured out another method. My method probably wasn't faster than figuring out the corrupt file problem and fixing it, but it was much easier. I first did a Windows search inside the folder that held the lyrics to narrow down which files I'd need. After finding the possible csv file, I opened it in Excel to see if the band was there.  When I found a band I wanted in a csv file, I loaded that csv and took out just the band(s) I wanted from it. For some of the csv files, I was able to use wildcards to load several files at a time and extract more than one band from the group.~~ With just the csv files I needed to use, I could use glob to read them all into one dataframe and sort everything out from there. This file still needs work to make it more elegant, but it's a start."
