Ghost Beach,"Every time I get up
My heart is in the basement
I can't get over it.
I never wanted to work for pieces of paper
But I guess that's all I get
Oh oh oh, oh oh-oo
I wanna win in this world but its pushing me out,
Oh oh oh, oh oh-oo
I was born in this house and I'm burning it down

Ah! it's a miracle
Even if it's in my head
Ah! like a miracle
I'm in love again

Everybody get out
We can't stand underwater
Can't seem to touch the ground
Your modern tongue
Keeps talking it over
But it doesn't make a sound
Oh oh oh, oh oh-oo
What you gonna say to me now? I'm calling you out,
Oh oh oh, oh oh-oo
'cause I was born in this house and I'm burning it down

Ah! it's a miracle
Even if it's in my head
Ah! like a miracle
I'm in love again

Ah! it's a miracle
Even if it's in my head
Ah! like a miracle
I'm in love again",Miracle
Ghost Machine,"Its been a long dark road but I remember when it meant the world ot me,
Its been a long dark day and a cold black night and it still gets hard to see,
Cause they don't know me and they never will,
Its been a long dark road I still remember why it took so much out of me,
Its a shallow pond we're swimming in and it makes it hard to breath,
Cause they don't know me and they never will 
No they don't know why or how it feels to live
Its been a long dark road and I remember skies that weren't so a hard to see,
Its been a long dark day and I remember nights that made me, me 
Cause they don't know me and they never will
And they don't know why or how it feels to live",Burning Bridges

I wanted to be pure
I wanted to be sure
I want it to be perfect
Perfectly flawed

She says she wants to be free
Says she's not happy to bleed for me
I want it to be real
Something I can feel
I wanted to explain
To all you unbelievers

This is the way you build a fire
These are the hands that will provide
You sleep you dream you get inspired 
By all the simple things in life

She's such a beautiful kid
Heaven will open and let her in
I wanted to be pure
I wanted to be so sure
I want it to be perfect
Now it's automatic

This is the way you build a fire
These are the hands that will provide
You sleep you dream you get inspired
By all the simple things in life

A little snapshot for your notes
Another chapter on the road
And if it kills you
It'll kill you when you're on your own
You got to tend to all your love
Pay attention to your love
It'll break your little heart

Ghost of Gloria,"As you calculate the time it'll take for me to collapse.
You're pacified in your complacency with me, 
As you claim the truth, with blades between your teeth.
But I refuse to feed a stray

I don't think I can fight anymore with your arrogance, lack of self control
I don't wanna give in to the signs of your empathy, 
And I fear of what might unfold.
And I know you'll never surrender the evidence
That proves you're responsible,
For all the things you've done to destroy your innocence.

You come around now,
And you ask for directions from me.
But I don't have a fuckin' thing to give to you.
I had to break down, for you to break down,
And now you're forcing me to pick up all these pieces
Honestly, I can't hold the weight
(So heavy) Of all the memories
(God help me) Of all the times
(You walked away) That you walked away

I don't think I can fight anymore with your arrogance, lack of self control
I don't wanna give in to the signs of your empathy
And I fear of what might unfold
And I know you'll never surrender the evidence
That proves you're responsible
For all the things you've done to destroy your innocence
So run away!

Ghost Riders,"I can see why you think you belong to me
I never tried to make you think
Or let you see one thing for yourself
But now you're off with someone else and I'm alone
You see I thought that I might keep you for my own

Amy, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Don't you think the time is right for us to find
All the things we thought weren't proper
Could be right in time, and can you see?
Which way we should turn together or alone?
I can never see what's right or what is wrong
(Will it take too long to see?)

Amy, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Well, Amy, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way
And all the things you thought before
Just faded into gray and can you see
That I don't know if it's you or if it's me?
But if it's one of us, I'm sure we'll both will see
Won't you look at me and tell me?

Amy, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do, longer if I do

Yeah, now, Amy what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

I keep fallin' in and out of love with you
Fallin' in and out of love with you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I'd keep fallin' in and out of love with you
Fallin' in and out of love with you",Amie
Ghost Town,"And the funeral screams
The song that it sings
The memories feel
What was everything
The sound rings loud
From a sick shotgun
What can never be fought
Can never be won

So sooner or later
I gotta believe

That she's getting
That she's getting better
While my heart bleeds
While I can't forget her
That she's getting
That she's getting better
While I'm running away
In my burden of shame

When my injuries are still
Like the eye of the storm
Then the feeling creeps in
Like a wave to the shore
Will I ever be whole
In the half where I'm not
What can never be found
Can never be lost

So sooner or later
I gotta believe

That she's getting
That she's getting better
While my heart bleeds
While I can't forget her

Ghost Town Trio,"Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
""Can I take you out to the pictures,
Joa, oa, oa, oan?""

But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene,

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be
So, o, o, o""

But when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

P. C. Thirty-one said, ""We caught a dirty one.""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o.

But as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise comes from behind.

I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip
Keep it low, faded licenses plates and great plate
Where's the cat from, think he's from New Jerusalem
Pretty Rick did his thing for him, but he was using him
Power sun, jungle, physical, you know the God
He go with Tim, the one who called Lover of God
Y. E.quality S.elf, I know the natural law now
It's time to get the God U and blow like mines
But on the Iow I heard he got BORN original sin

We got to get him Dunn, aliens is snatching our bread
U.F.O.'s moving in with bigger plans than Fed, yo
Knock on Daddy-O's door get the scope
He's not home, he took Ishmael to Park Slope
There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that stuff
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace Keana, what's up with your girlfriend Wanda
She drive a green Honda, with legs like Jane Fonda
I just left her, she took Rashean to Pathmark then
Jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She said be back in ninety minutes, Ghostface God forbid
She say, peace to W, who's watching the kids?

Two hours later, scheaming like DeNiro in Casino
Son better have more coke than Al Pacino
Keana ain't telling no lies, last year she did a sting and a half
And Tymeek bought her a aircraft
But anyway, yo, Daddy-O home, we need the shotties nidow
When we get back, throw you a bit out
Later that night, stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of Marriott
You ready, you got the E&J and the machete?
We going upstairs, I hope one nigga is empty
We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, Dunn yo, I handle this
Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical
Natural, fucking a white bitch, actual
Fiends chanting, ""Do your thing Chef, handle it""
I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzing, much disguising
Surprise we coming and their eyes were tranquilized
And bugging, throwing her twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncing
Fake cats announcing on the block, you lounging
Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop fronting
(Yo Chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll start stunting
Bitch, show that bit, before I push your wig back
Chef stop waving that, show him where the paper at)
Come here Valerie, you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery
It's in the kitchen in the ceiling

Only found a white block of cheese from New Zealand

Three months man
Whatchu doin in here anyway?  You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy?
Thirteen
Thirteen?  Damn, the bastards must be runnin outta niggaz to arrest

Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box 
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again
Heheheh, yeah heheheheh ahaheheheh

Ghostface Killah,"It's assassination day, I stalk

I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line
I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter
From the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark
Pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered
My unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible
Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retreat through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God
His shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra
UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops know
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

It's assassination day, I stalk",Assassination Day

We elbowed our way inside loud and got on
I played the building, burn a branch and get filled in
Like Pilgrims G-in' Pepridge farms from out a million
Who wanna rhyme? who wanna challenge the swordsman?
That rock that fisherman hat like Gorden's

Gamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil
Man handle brain killin' erect my hidden
Streets may be potent put your 9-6 bid in
Vampire Curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water, act slaughter through my earth
You're hit by my element Great Wall of China
Mountain Peak hold the globe like vagina
Measure on my mic stand, molecule and strand
Finger rollin' rhythm ride the horse one hand

Chess boxer, mic in dead body position

Black down, numerous rounds, boots is brown
Getaway driver, this white bitch from out of town
We love horse races shakin Jakes and high-speed chases
Porno stations, drinkin violations, godly nations

Bangin earaches, lay my verse down in two takes

Pretty niggas want to play the war po-sin
When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen
Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man
Holding court from my Wu, indivisible clan

Who you with? Me and Molly and some trick who's Yugoslavian
What fabric is that? It's only wool and Rayon
Lipstick crayon, fly Fahrenheit spray on
I'm getting tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
And transporting bricks stealing many fifties
Fuck negotiating, is you with me is you waiting
Sweet as carrot cake, faking plus you don't eat turkey bacon
I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither
Cuban links skeezer, why you acting like a rap teaser
I'm like the jewelry exchange plus a range
Nigga you small change I only fuck for figaro chains
Analyzing Miss Clairol, Fendi down, mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon

Socializing, vibing with my eyes on Dot
She this book cover lady that be blowing up the spot
While my heart was racing, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me putting out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay too
Your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another
Black sister to brother
I'm thinking all the time how she could be my lover

What's happening brown sugar? Say you look so good today
Ankle bracelet wrapped around your leg
Here have a seat, complimentary drinks is on me
Bartender, Chevalier Chateau at table three
Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling
What's your name sugar? Juanita Cash Hawkins
Your complexion gives a reflection of
Sometime a black woman just need to be loved
Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high
Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that five?
Just joking baby, I have a sharp sense of humour
Wish I would've bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you working at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy living
Love kids and, keep all our business in the crib and
And not afraid to die with me the God on your side
We holding hands til death do us apart and then we slide
Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo
Should have left my Wis' a thousand times maybe tonight though
Yo you sexy motherfucker, damn what's the recipe?
You make a nigga wanna god damn!
Can you cook darling? At the stove you're evolving
Baked macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starving
Here take my number let me pull the chair from under
I had fun plus your backyard speak with thunder",Camay
Ghostface Killah,"We are the G, O-D's
And we came to rock, the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Bees

Say peace to cats who rock mack knowledge
Knowledgists, street astrologists
Light up the mic God, knowledge this
Fly joints that carried your points
Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, he pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Rapel on fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck your union
It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turn style
On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials
Especially that, aluminum bat in the act
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black
The Mac-10 flex white cats like Windex
Index finger be sore, busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing em, jet to the stash and now Jerusalem
Abusing em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older God, build with the Son and the Star

That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit, like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbin niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be metal like Von Harper radio bubble
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Body chemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slap box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zooming like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My Benz spills, what up Lils
Murder one Dunn
Killer bee stung, guess who back home Son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, probably wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, lord of dooms, in fat pussy wombs
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it
And keep it, jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang
Sweep it out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Don is too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is handcocked
Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot

I control 26,000 men. Except for dope, we operate in all aspects
Of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin

We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs
In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties

Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash one, I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like eskimo flow
Cappa villain stay chillin' take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine

Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life
Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling
Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit
Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral
Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule
Big time, play it like Canadian wine
RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind
Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigga roaster
Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced
Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop
Figaro fly jewelin', tri-color Cubans
Swerving we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans
Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant
Dons sending my sons membership forms
And still getting this paper scraper

How can I survive without bubbling weight?

that white rock, and then give birth to a knot
Your biggest dream was to rock your 850 and beam
You and the Gods buy a crib in the white part of Queens
But at the same time, niggas on the block is ill
Some'll rock you to sleep, hap, for selling cross pills
Being watched all day like enemy's prey
Faces, you never seen before is in your hallway

Vaseline lips is cracked cause they all had dreams
They overdue, these Gods own a mosque in Peru
Tropical trees and weaves where they grew bamboo
Olympic minds quick flash like a leak on
A hundred shares short to own Nissan, watch em get they feast on

But I'm, but I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there
In that great, big ol' sky
Oh my, oh my, oh my
It's been a long, long time
A long time coming
Change gonna come
Yes it will

Sorry boys,
All the stitches in the world can't sew me together again
Lay down, lay down
Gonna stretch me out in Fernandez funeral home on hun and ninth street
Always knew I'd make a stop there
But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
Last of the Mahicans
Well, maybe not the last
Can't come with me on this trip, Loaf
Getting the shakes now
Last call for drinks
Bar's closing down
Sun's out
Where we going for breakfast?
Don't wanna go far
Rough night
Tired, baby
Tired

Was convincing the world he didn't exist

Ghostface Killah,"I'm mind shocking, body rocking, earth shaking, money making
Sitting high, looking fly, drinking on the best wine

Yo bitch I fucked your friend, yeah you stank hoe
I seen her on the elevator, honey grabbed my Kangol
She put me on to mega-shit, bout to slap the bitch
She shot crazy verbal, I leaned back like I'm rich
It took place late night on February 17th
Hands flooded like ink, my face on her magazine
Just got back from Honolulu, pockets stacking boucoup cash
Girlfriend sipped the Yoo-hoo and laughed, yo
While I was on tour, whore, you went to work
Quick fast, had a nigga dick in the dirt
You couldn't wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm
Where's you at, hoe? 'Pinky house, she put in my perm'
That's all you ever said to me, thought that could hold me
Remember when I long-dicked you and broke your ovary?
You crab bitch, chicken-head hoe, eatin' heroes
I'm the first nigga that had you watching flicks by DeNiro
You gained crazy points, baby, just being with God
Taught you how to eat the right foods, fast, and don't eat lard
I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
You didn't do the knowledge what the God was manifesting
You sneaky fuck bitch, your ways and actions told it all
I fucked you while you was bleedin, held you down in malls
Sexually you worshiped my di-dick like a cross
I had you fiend out, broke out, for a month you fell off
You was my main shit, my peeps showed you love on the strength
You saw how I got down, the way I thought had you tranked
But you had to fuck this rasta-head ass nigga
I should of slapped ya but the Gods said chill
That's your wiz fault, god, handle that in the lab""
I'm wondering how many times your hot ass got stabbed
You dumb bitch, horny hot fuck from out the mountains
Your clientele is low hoe, catch you next show, bro
I got jerked, gave away my pussy, that shit hurt
It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth
But fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs
Broken tables, had you screaming while you was biting on my cables
Whistling to the washing machine, I threw it on spin
If your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in
My dick's the bomb baby, marvelous hot steak
Plus I'm conceited Starks make the biggest so-called rape
I'm God, cipher divine love my pussy real fine
That means clean the FDS smell with a shine
Word up, respect that hoe",Wildflower
Ghostface Killah,"Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam nine diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Norte Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, buddah palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alledged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc(ious) handheld trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralyzed when you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld tote mm-hmm

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more

A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks just like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravangza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, trying to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cos you weak in the knees, like SWV
Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA Rob name printed in the tablet

Stealing my light, huh? Watch me, duke, watch me

Yo, check these up top murderous
Snowy in the bezzle as the cloud merges
F.B.I. try and want word with this
Kid who punked out bust a shot up in the beacon
Catch me in the corner not speaking
Crushed out heavenly, U.G. rock the sweet daddy long fox minks
Chicken and broccoli, Wally's look stinky
With his man straight from Raleigh Durham, he recognized Kojak
I slapped him five, Masta Killa cracked his tiny form
Everybody break bread, huddle around
Guzzle that, I'm about to throw a hand in your bag
Since the face been revealed, game got real
Radio been gassing niggas, my impostors scream they ill
I'm the inventor, '86 rhyming at the center
Debut '93 LP told you to Enter
Punk fagot niggas stealing my light
Crawl up in the bed with grandma,
beneath the La-Z-Boy where ya hid ya knife
Ghost is back, stretch Cadillac's, fruit cocktails
Hit the shells at Paul's Pastry Rack
Walk with me like Darthy tried to judge these
plush degrees, said the cow, wrap the fees
Getting waxed all through the drive-through
Take the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible
and tell lies too, I'm the ultimate
splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite
student in role holding it

Hey yo, this rappin's like Ziti, facin me real TV
Crash at high-speeds, strawberry, kiwi
As we approach, yo herb, the Gods bail
These Staten Island ferryboat cats bail
Fresh cellies, 50 thief up in the city
We banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real

A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max
Hit the racks, stack 'em up Son, $20 off no tax
Street merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurging
Rock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird
Monday night Dallas verse Jets, dudes slid in with one hand
Two culture-ciphers, one bag of wet
Heavy rain fucked my kicks up
Wasn't looking, splashed in the puddle
Bitch laughing, first thought was beat the bitch up
Mossied off gracefully, New York's most wanted tee-ball hawk
Seen the yellow brick road, lust of pastries
Same Ghostface, holy in the mind
Last scene, Manhattan Chase
We drew the six-eight digit in the briefcase
Rawness, title is Hell-bound
Quick to reload around faces, surround look astound

We split a fair one, poker nose money
Gin rummy with glare, spot the lame, bit his ear
Yo, you taste a tea-spoon, 300 goons, stash balloons
Locked in lab rooms, hit with glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb
Clocked him like a patient, his stock's full, hustle invasion
Knowing now, we cocked a block off, the chain tri-color
Freezing in valor, ice-sicle galore
Gas station light gleaming on the wall
Cop WiseGuy jams, James Bond vans
Niggas flipped Timbs, rock boats under water, watch clams
pose at the stand-off, mad timid
hoping that the gun fall, guess him like lottery balls, yo

Who I'm is? We ain't got shit, something got to give
Y'all done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the crib
Die and live for my nigs and my bad-ass kids, freeze
Looking at your ice like GEEZ!
I'm plotting on the mousetrap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is bout that, psychotherapy
You bugging where the couch at? Wu, til they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not broke, let it be
Ain't nothing nice in, New York
Stick you for your cake and your icing
That tough talk? Don't mean nothing when you're up North
So keep them hands where I can see em like you want freedom
You know that saying, if you can't join 'em, beat 'em
And push your way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the pace up, pants sagging pull your waist up
Niggas renting slums usually Jacob, FOOL!
You're like, ""Dude! I don't like your fuckin attitude
Frontin on my Clan from the Stat' when we ain't mad at you""

Yo, yo

The joopy look, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, ""Ghost you so crazy!""

Post up like paint on walls
Drip jewels, big heat
Ruffle inside the bubble goose
It's the Odd Couple
Hollow points follow you home, Staten Island

Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Duncan Hines
Didn't know Betty Crocker had them two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dustheads runnin (yo)
The rap kingpin bust the Black Jesus is comin

Yo
The words you talk, that'll be the words you walk
Body you in the bed where the nurses are
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Til it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like in training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stairs
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets, flying)
Yo, the hard wire, starting barn fires
Pulling mad, so you know it's me
And your weed got more seeds than ODB
Can't smoke with ya, watch Ghost tie rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya

Eat a dick like
Baby shake your shit, girl you're thick like
Getting rich like

""There's no love to be found""

Word it's me y'all
We in two-six's flirting with bitches
Dime plus taking pictures, how you doing baby? My name Ghost
Don't get caught up in my chains, or the way that I speak
Seek intelligence, slickest nigga going since ""Grease""
Check out the grays on the side of my waves
I grew those on Riker's Island
Stretched out, balled up in the caves
Pull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come
Biggie's Versace's, snow white rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic, funeral love
Moving when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym for two weeks, come back all chiseled
Elbows unique now, meet the new me
Ghettofabulous, Ton' Atlas

Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, STOP! (Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these (She's a hottie, hottie)

Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of rats

Waist like a Coke bottles scoring

And times she got my ding-a-ling hard
When she said push hard, she kept Vaseline
Open as she swung back, couldn't help her dress blue back
Now held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rocking wallows
Drawing crads, sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolomite, few tips from Goin's
Birthday, gave her two 50 cent coins
Puppy love, gorgeous face, amazed by lip gloss
Cherry cent, when the princess spoked yo it bounced off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe, threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs. Coke

Hope the years go slow, slow
Surrounded by intelligence, life through education
Healthy minds will grow, grow

But you still telling lies to me

I broked her chicko's sticks

Those were the days right there
Boston baked beans, girls come to school with mad candy
You know what I mean? You'd just come in school for half days, and all that
Just to see that little girl right there, rememer I just to just

May hump the bed sometimes on her, you know what I mean?
Word, those days man, those, those were the good old days right there G
That shit was fun, lunchroom, see in the lunchroom, you know what I mean?
Might get a little, go to the G.O. Store or something, you know what I mean?
Word, buy a little chocolate, a little shake or something, you know what I mean?
A little butter crunch joints or something, you know what I mean?

Cash the bill, frozen elements in gold
Signs from the most high causes me to break the mold
How the fuck was y'all niggas thinking? You think I fell off the ledge?
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead?
Never, impossible, pull out black burners like tonsils
Two Gallants, hitting if we got to
Busting at y'all niggas daily

Dead serious, knowledge by 2% triple geese

Formed like Christ and the disciples
Black fatigues, lethal-faced dunnie, he held the rifle

On the low tucking they links

One of the illest since Magic Johnson, no disrespect
With metaphors that keep me out the Project
Rap connects'll keep me correct

After his funeral, on one knee
Thinking his killer's following me
So to my nigga Donnie, up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here?
You got beer, weed, guns, AIDS
All these obstacles, it's hard to make it nowadays
Why's the Devil winning, some say it's our fault
If that's the answer, you know smoking cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet, leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginning cause that's how they rewind
Y'all know how we dine, we don't eat swine, and we don't drink wine
If you don't bring me some motherfucking cognac, I kill you

Ghostface Killah,"Both hands clusty, chillin' wit my man Rusty low down
Blew off the burner kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect you red pro
Son trifling fuck, wildflower on the cycling
Pick up the brew thought I was Michael an'
Mics are writin' pool, now, I'm into Iron Duals
Turn-ons the Earth's whoopee, she out of law school
In hale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel
Duracell night, you flash a burnt cell
Snap out of CandyLand, kids the old rumor is
blacks become immune to shit, we never did like
eati' dead birds chose the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the herbs pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter
Livin' off land you god damn right I fuck fans king me
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stocks with Bill Gates now

When we hug these mics we get busy
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle
Scream, shout, laugh and just giggle
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm sayin'

Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in the grass it's spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game wish you could see us
We lay low glitter wax full bangles
Priceless rolls, lay around the God get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes firey red, feet made of brass
Twelve men, following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smash the big boy totalled it, will shot fear effects
Son beamin' wifee on the beach, sippin' Zima
Wu 'binos, to latinos, we bust Selena
Over night, God schedules, fed ex
Pretty soloette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics
Too hot, to handle one thought scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack em, say when
He rolling up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid stop frontin' on the ground before you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess, obsessed with Allah's sun
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry",Mighty Healthy
Ghostface Killah,"Scientific, my hand kissed it
Robotic let's think optimistic
You probably missed it, watch me dolly dick it
Scotty Wotty copped it to me, big microphone hippie
Hit Poughkeepsie crispy chicken verbs throw up a stone richie
Chop the O, sprinkle a little snow inside a Optimo
Swing the John McEnroe, rap rock'n'roll
Tidy Bowl, gun hold pro, Starsky with the gumsole
Hit the rum slow, parole kids, live Rapunzel
But Ton' Stizzy really high, the vivid laser eye guy
Jump in the Harley ride, Clarks I freak a lemon pie
I'm bout it, bout it - Lord forgive me, Ms. Sally shouted
Tracey got shot in the face, my house was overcrowded
You fake cats done heard it first
On how I shitted on your turf that time
Cuban Link verse yo
Check out the rap kingpin, summertime fine jewelry dripping
Face in the box, I seen your ear twitching
As soon as I drove off, Cap' came to me with three sawed-offs
Give one to Rae', let's season they broth
Lightning rod fever heaters, knock-kneeder Sheeba for hiva
Diva got rocked from the receiver bleeder
Portfolio, looking fancy in the pantry
My man got bigger dimes son, your shit is scampi
Baste that, throw what's in your mouth, don't waste that
See Ghost lamping in the throne with King Tut hat
Straight off

Yeah, yeah
I just want y'all niggas
Smack all y'all niggas, and niggarettes
Universal death threats, yeah
This be the God Body
Yeah no doubt, Judge Wise

Aiyyo spiced out Calvin Coolers, lounging with 7 duelers
The Great Adventures of Slick, licking with 6 Rugers
Rock those, big boy Bulotti's out of Woodbridge
Porch for the biggest beer, season giraffe ribs
Rotissiere ropes, hickory cinnamon scented glaze
Perfected find truth within self, let's smoke
All hail to my hands, 50 thou' appraisal
Dirty nose with the nasal drip, click flipped on fam
Dancing with Blanche and them bitches, flicking goose pictures
Kick down the ace of spades, snatch Jack riches
Olsive compulsive lies flyers with my name on it
Dick made the cover now count, how many veins on it
Scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap
Ten years working for me, you wanna tap shit?
Bong bong bong! Your bell went rung rung rung!
Staple-Land's where the ambulance don't come

Yeah, you see what I mean?
You see what I mean, you motherfucking crybabies?
Get in line punk! You should be studying your arts
Instead of studying me
That's how you lost your first job punk
Now get in line, before you get your lil' thick ass tossed up!
Shit! I studied under Bruce Lee nigga
He was on the fourth, I was on the third

Pass me a honey-dipped spliff, black mental cause continental drift
One whiff of Pow U gets my Divine stiff
Brick rock, late night, hear the tick tock of my clock
I used to run up and pick, a crab lock
Hit his stash, dip back, to the Lab, make him flip
Uptown, BOO-DOOP, now we back on your ass
Incognito, fatal aikido blow, pop a needle
Dick a knock-knee ho, bust out her fetal
Nine inch long strong, Bobby pop the bitch thongs
Spit on her, then I bang on my chest like Kong King
Merciless Ming, point the killer bee sting
Ring dings, right through your head bing
Snap the wing off of bats, my battle-axe tongue hacks tracks
Once the ball drop, I'mma snatch ten jacks
Pass the crack to a niggarette, puff a loose leaf cigarette
While your man search the internet for Bob Digitech in Stereo
Crazy as Shapiro
Multiply myself ten times standing next to zero
And snap my fingers like the Fonz
And bag me a golden bronze skinned girl with the honey blonde
Dip hair, make a nigga flip in his chair
Had the armpit shaved off perfect with the Nair
Stomach flat as a pancake for her man's sake
Used to fuck her when she menstruate, but it made her hyperventilate

Brooklyn! I know, I know, I know, I know
Queens! I know, I know, I know, I know
Shaolin! I know, I know, I know, I know

To glorious days, check it out y'all
We back, yes yes y'all
Masked avengers, we're here to sharpen your sword
All praises due to T.M.F., Wu-Tang Clan
Scream on it, Ghost

A-yo, we at the weedgate, waiting for Jake
We want eight ravioli bags, two thirsty villians yelling bellyaches
Heavyweight rhyme writers, hitting the grass that's the ripest
Pull out this kite from this white bitch
Talking 'bout, ""Dear Ghost, you the only nigga I know
Like when the cops come, you never hide your toast""
Guest starred in mad shit, CBL, Ice Water metallic
Past tense placed in gold caskets
Dru Hill bitches, specialist lounging at the mosque
Suede kufi wrap, undercover dentist
Rhymes is made of garlic, never in the target when the NARCs hit
Rumor is you might start to spit
You nice Lord, sweet daddy Grace, wind lifted
On the dancefloor, makeover's free followed by gauze
Duncan Hines monument cakes, we never half-baked
Alaskan, sexcapade, push your new court dates
Trauma, hands is like candy canes, lay my balls on ice
The branches in my weed be the vein
Swimsuit issue, darts sent truly from the heart, boo, I miss you
See daddy rock a wristful
Modern slave God, graveyard spells, fog your goggles
Laying like needles in the hospital
Five steps to conquer, ask Bernadette, big ass whistle
Ziploc your ear, hear thistle

To my real bitches take your drawers off
To all my high niggas, snatch her skirt off
Just in case she wanna play, get up in that bitch face
And tell her Ghost said, ""Take your clothes off!""

A-yo, the Devil planted fear inside the black babies
Fifty cent sodas in the hood, they going crazy
Dead meat placed on the shelves, we eat cold cuts
Fast from the hog y'all and grow up

A-yo, crash through, break the glass, Tony with the goalie mask
That's the pass, heavy ice Roley laying on the dash
Love the grass, cauliflower hurting when I dumped the trash
Sour mash served in every glass up at the Wally Bash
Sunsplash, autograph blessing with your name slashed
Backdraft, four-pounders screaming with the pearly ash
Children fix the contrast as the sound clashes
Mrs. Dash, sprinkle with her icicle eyelash
Ask Cappa Pendergrass for backstage passes
Special guest, no more Johnny Blaze, Johnny Mathis
Acrobat, run up on that Love Jones actress
Distract the cat while I'm high sugar get a crack at this
Dicking down Oprah, jumprope, David Dinkins
Watch the black mayor of DC hit the mocha
Tangerine sofa, two super soakers in the Rover
Hit the sport's bar, tell a young lady to bend over
Meditated yoga, Paddle Ball, dancing with the vulture
Castor Troy laying for Travolta
Yo, switch the lingo, five-nine-seventy
God glow, seven fifteen four be ebony

A-yo, the Devil planted fear inside the black babies

Saturday night, Uptown
Riding past Kansas Fried Chicken
What's popping kid? We in the mix
It's chilly 40 below
Gate's closed gotta catch Dr. J's
Blowing my hand, rub on my nose
Tap the glass, stop fronting Duke, fresh pair of jeans
Look I got loot, eleven in the Bass boots
Heard a screech pull up, these Jakes flashed me 5 pictures
One had my man's mug, Semi stepped brother hugs
You asked the wrong guy son
I'm from Melina, yeah we know Mr. Coles
Flew in two days ago to see his fam'
But we been watching you, crazily
The whole Staten Island shitting on you
Wisdom Bird's pregnant out in Baisley
Hold up snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up
Not trunk today, still looking fly, still slammed up hung
Your mom pop in your trunk, slow your pace
Starks fixed your face, copped out the 6, five years probat'
You dealing with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watching you
Make me want to lick shots at you
You disgust me, screwing me down, grab my gun
Go 'head bust me, heard you hate Jake that's what it must be
Hands behind your back, spread your legs
Just found a roach in your tray
It's not mine fucker, what I said
You met the 13th nigga
A multimillion dollar operation is based upon it yo
Where in the Hell's the RZA?
He's selling mics, wildest joints
Special made to go up in your hand and which went out on point
Switched to the next scene, I'm at the crib bugging out
On how po' live, hating plus harassing the kid
Park the truck in the double face garage
Dial 1-900-Raekwon, tell the God shit's mega

Ghostface Killah,"Make me wan' pop sumthin', no champagne
Two-five on me, weed and crack on me
Bitch motherfucker tried to get a rep' off me
Leave him there, never know, get him off me
I remember days when we just fucked bitches
Bought a lot of clothes and, played the ave
Now we rap niggas with a lot of wardrobes
And if we want a nigga dead we pay the cash
I ain't tryin to waste my career on y'all
Even scuffle with y'all, waste gear on y'all
But if I gotta go out, you know I'mma show out
You gon' fuck around and get your whole back blown out
I remember on the Island, can't tone out
The mess hall crawler, about to zone out
Dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out
We just dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out

See me
I roll with Ghost and cats that carry they toast
Make the Post, front page and, center-Stagin'
When it's time to bust off them things, it ain't a game man
We rocked out own diamond rings, see them 'Bling, Bling'
Got big boy toys, push Sixes
Dime bitches, told y'all before we import those
Jury stay froze, court cases get closed
Niggas hate Nino cuz how fast I rose up
Like George Jefferson and em, steppin on em
The headline read, ""Starks had the weapon on em""
The best, what y'all expect? He a vet
Plus the best, now tell me how we gon' fail
When we dealin with 'Supreme Clientele']

We thugs like, life is the same challenge
Do the knowledge, recognize your talent
And if you live the streets, you better stay silent

Yo, spotted at The Mirage, Ghostface swarmed by groupies
Mingle amongst stars, I come in cat, invades Mars
Highlight of the century, first bet placed upon entry
Fainted when the book mentioned me
Keep ballin, new systems, high sciences
Drop that, Ghost listenin, track sizzlin
Angelica, Judy Plum for bitches, Goines king of the century
Best sellers for niggas, stay together
Posted up trucks, leanin on the Benz
Cinemax smile shot in thrity-five lens
You program, broke bottles of Dom
Seven inch bangles, back breakers
I'm a dope fiend, look at my arm, Popeye strength
Rap with a British accent, Gucci clothes
Dennis Coles in the latest fashions
Blow backs in, flip raps like fourty-eight bundles
Dinner plates, deadly front gates, celeb Bryant Gumbel

Analyze This shit like Deniro, words in your center earhole
Blocks of ice like Sub-Zero, we been right since day zero
Shatter your soul like glass windows
Turn virgins to nymphos, pop these hollows at fake cats in a Tahoe
Wild out, throw your liquor bottles at hood rats to the richest models
We conversate like Christ and the twelve apostles
Livin life without you, can't count you as great men
Murderers in the state pen', bein caged in
The wages of sin, before they read up they pop our tape in
You ain't gotta tuck you chain in cuz here we want the head of Satan
Durags and our pants hangin",We Made It
Ghostface Killah,"Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants

My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin' shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holding out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in hip-hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape, of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan a make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements, kept environments colonized
With the high flying death-defying flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year, from my level

Uh-huh, yeah, yo, check it, yo
Bottles goin off in the church, we broke the wine
Slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma
He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Ooh! Rev ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his eyes
Mrs. Parks said, ""Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot
Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot""
Shirley fainted dead on the spot
Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot
Oh shit!

Egyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs
Masquerading X-rated throw blades, all occasions
Round nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Daas gobbles White House
Gucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups
Mere intelligent, buy Nieman Marc' it out
No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow
Was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you
The way we lamp, fans come and get you
Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at
The black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack
Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do
It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew
Coconut, incense, one sentence, hey yo
Control the holy flinch hit this, new whips
Roman numerals, sun splash them niggas like, Tango and Cash
Alcatraz cats roll out fast

Wu thousand nothing but hardcore
We trying to get land riches and more
Ghost put me on to it
We just do it, floss or whatever
Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks
Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost
Had to beat niggas with toast
Clubs V.I. clientele we lay it down flat
Poot out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?
Faking the real like, ""Damn I can't stand Cappa'""
Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter
Y'all heard about us like we heard about you
Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue
Calm down not tryin to hurt you, burst through
That shit, fatter than all y'all niggas outfits
We the glitch like Y2K
Catch the ball when it drop, guns pop, y'all have a nice day

""Doctor Kanabuta, Iron Man, he is invincible
His remarkable armor is supreme!""

Yo
Sometimes I'm liable to spaz and break fool
Grab my gun, select one, snatch son
Put the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum
Piss run, you drop thinking you shot
Screaming like a bitch, kicks to your face
Shots to the body that shake like the bass
I'm Ghostfaced up, military style down
'Nough ammunitions of rounds across the chest

Skip to the intro, rap through po'
Smashed a fresh ball of wax Caesar
Flashy penthouse that overlooks the vista
Wally Moc' have tie, swimming trunks
Three chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice
Catch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless
Polish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick
Carefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights
Too bright Ghost is coming y'all fix the mirrors
Relax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't
Exile he no longer in the hood
Bless the kid that max the most

Brothers try to pass me, but none could match me
No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, STOP! (Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these (She's a hottie, hottie)

Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of rats
I know they are over

One in the head, I'm fed, this is how we doin
Put a Ruff Rider on my dick, bust right through 'em
Come out your shirt, insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr. Buzzard, Bacardi Lime

White miniskirt with a Betty Boom bum
She had a ass like Deborah Cox, face like Lauryn
Waist like a Coke bottles scoring
Pretty young thing loved the swings
And times she got my ding-a-ling hard
When she said push hard, she kept Vaseline
Open as she swung back, couldn't help her dress blue back
Now held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rockin' wallows
Drawin' crads, sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolomite, few tips from Goines
Birthday, gave her two 50 cent coins
Puppy love, gorgeous face, amazed by lip gloss
Cherry cent, when the princess spoked yo it bunched off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe, threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs. Coke

Hope the years go slow, slow
Surrounded by intelligence, life through education
Healthy minds will grow, grow

Thinking to myself some nights she got (""powered"")
But hating, was Shinene and Grace and Key-lolo
Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago
Hit me, you hit me, Grace got the last hit
Eh yo, the bitches started swinging and shit
So I jumped in
Those were the days, made faces in school plays
Paper trays, city wide test, made half a days
Shooting puppy water, might hump the pillow, dick a inch taller
Stapleton bum nigga, I'll pop her cherry for her
Fresh air fun, here's dunn, alphabets, berets
Jellies, bubble yum, soda tongue, too young to cum
Then engage him with them candy rings
Eh yo, I hit that shit, got jealous when she kissed Rob
I broked her chicko's sticks

Guys and girls, y'all remember those days, and shit
Girls walk around in school, one ponytail with the beret
Next looking like baby powder, you know what I mean?
Those were the days right there
Boston baked beans, girls come to school with mad candy
you know what I mean? You'd just come in school for half days, and all that
Just to see that little girl right there, ? to this
Go home and think about it, you know what I mean?
May hump the bed sometimes on her, you know what I mean?
Word, those days man, those, those were the good old days right there G
That shit was fun, lunchroom, see in the lunchroom, you know what I mean?
Might get a little, go to the G.O. Store or something, you know what I mean?
Word, buy a little chocolate, a little shake or something, you know what I mean?
A little butter crunch joints or something, you know what I mean?
That's that real shit, G I miss those shits, man

Hey yo, my wiz play the flute, I stroll through the forest like
Peace, pussies, trees, hello, how was your day? Have you seen the prince? 
Haven't seen him since he pushed Humpty Da-Dumpty fell off the fence 
The smurfs fell out laughin', Heckle toe Jeckle at min,
They took my medicade card, he's a good friend
Bugs still sniffin', Daffy Duck snitchin'
And heard that crazy Bird took the stand on the Simpsons
Bet you ""my golly, oh glory"" with a story to tell 
Droopy got knocked, now he Muslim in jail
His name is Abdrul, Colorful, Snow White tattoo
She used to send him mad flicks in Cash Rule
And the cat too, old girl who's clackin' her shoes
And that wicked witch broke her broom, clappin' at school
It happens every night, I seen it, shoot outs in Jellystone Park
Kermit had the whip, he did from the Narks
They bagged Woody, Shaggy shot dead in his hoodie
Tweety did the Bird, ""I thaw, I thought I thaw a putty""
Ghost, please you don't even want to know
Droopy Long wrote a song, like to hear it, here it go
Ricochet Rabbit had a habit, he was savage
Bruto slapped, Magoto slapped out his glasses backwards
Magelity used to come to class wit rachets
He was known in the hood, plus good for his classics
Slashes, blast four-fifths, diamond cut, hollow point tips
Big Boy bustin' out his corderoy fix
Eleven, way beyond is little boy fit
Magoo, he gon' catch him at the teachers' conference
So later that week durin' open school night
Everybody there, saw open school fight
Blows is big, Olive Oil was pissed
The wolf was too, they murdered one of the pigs
He said, ""What great big heat you have""
He replied, ""Fuck my gun I'll eat you fast""
He said, ""What great big teeth you have""
""Mothafu, you better look at all the beef you have""

Ghostface Killah,"This Nigga just bought eleven machine guns
And he brought them in my crib

Glittered out, stout face, teck, Rae up in the Hilton
Heard Nia Long is in the building
Penthouse fashion, ordered out room service
It looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous
Lift off the lid, seen two shiny thirty-eights aimed at the kid
What I do, duck!
Rae up in the shower singing
Son don't know that it's real
Coming looking like he about peel something
In a tight jam, red down, matching like Santa
If I could just reach my hammer
He bust two shots, I played mice
Ran to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice
That's when Rae ran out of the back
Towel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap

Yo, what the fuck happened?

It was a set up to get wet up

Starks your bleeding

Nah, his blood fucked my white leather up
Ten G's down the drain
Yo hurry up, we got to get him up
Get the sheets son, let's fix him up
Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch

Just give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices

(Ghostface Killah)
The hit came quick
Hit the jack, star six

Put down the phone stupid
Wipe off your prints

Rae ran hysterically
Slipped on soap
Landed on his back, with his gat, now that's dope
We got three minutes, nobody seen shit
Somebody might have heard shit
Singing on some Martin, were my momma bird shit
Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock
Everything all right? Partying son, balloons popped
Threw this dude under the bed
A half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds
Had money in juice up on his wedding day
The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me,
What you want sweaty, Lima beans and kidney
Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer
Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper
Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut
Praying how me make it out the telly and touch

Fuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
Caught up in the grimy shit
Finding two days later a murder and we got to make this flight shit
It was a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
A Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer

Hey yo, the pressures on, sonny got murk
Its time to move fast
Hey yo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash
Flew out the next day, back to the Tony estates
Blew on the first class flight to L.A.
It ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn
So were it came from?
That nigga we stuck and took the caine from
We should have killed him when we had him
Yo I was holding a Magnum
Yeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon
His bad little brown ho, from out Chicago
She move his cargo, good at handling Roscoes
We had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming
He should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning
Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on
It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song
Dawned on me later on
By then the day was gone
How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on
Smoke the Cee Allah
Sent the kite through the Pens
Him and big Dan
Known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems
Giants from Attica riots
Halls is quiet
CO's with babies on their arms look tight
And this nigga from down state got shipped up north
Stocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off
Then heard that shit, plus got that kite

The pound fell, cops is coming
Running through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Bugging, only thing I remember was the bullshit summons
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is falling
My pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D.T.s had, black, they was rated P.G
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to.. Ghost here they come now!
Errr! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on a rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They amp shit, plant shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home with no fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me in shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killing shit, they must got word
That I told the chief of Rich Port I don't wanna merge

Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you getting chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like wontons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, is like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns! Muthafucka

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred hundred-packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuffed shells
I'm cutting niggas' throats on the sales, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothing unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dipping with that
Uh, down-shifting on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, running like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Thruway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm trying to hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm ashmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
Imagine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you getting chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like wontons

Blow a nigga a jewel and watch him slide away

You bet your ass that the 4/5'll cook, fuck your wack looks
Fuck platinum, fuck, let me show y'all crooks
This is legit rap, I.R.S. can suck my books

I'm a family man, Clan mixed with Theodore
My boots hang over the telephone wires on Broad'
Word to MetLife, Tony got insurance on his mics
Smoke mad shit and still got endurance when he fight

Both hands clusty, bank account dusty!
Ever, say, my name, again, you pussy!
Like, an angry, cripple, man, don't push me!
Don't believe the kid, listen to me..

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Dirty told me to rock the spot (yeah)
Freak the beats 'cause the streets is raw (go 'head)
Don't believe what you see, just watch (true)
Speak to the seeds, give 'em lead on jobs (come on)

Educate, keep it peace wit Gods (that's right)
In return, happiness in globs (yeah)
We see the future like a psychic's palm

[Allah Real]
The things I'm saying are true
And the way I explain them to you, yes to you
Listen to me

[Chorus]",Holla
Ghostface Killah,"Yo, ah-yo this joint right here is about
When you goin' through mad shit
And it just seem like you get out of it, nowhere and shit
You thinkin' you puttin' your shit in and you thinkin'
You gettin' over, and doin' all this other shit
But before you know it, your whole world just caved in on you, pa
Check the joint, it's, uh-huh, yeah, I walked into the place
Verse one

[Chorus]
Over, and then my life (the masquerade)
I know it's over (the masquerade)
Uh-oh, over (over) my my my good day is over
(Over) the masquerade is over (over)
It's over (over)

Back in '95 when I was juggling bitches
Pumping coke out the spot, smacking fiends in the kitchen
All around dick sucks whenever, blowing chronic out of Philly's
Getting flusty in the Cub' Link era
Niggas telling me my spot is hot
They like I think any day now, playboy, shit going pop

Back then I was the fat Ghost, them came March 1st
My eighth platoon got murked, got burnt for all our work
After the funeral, I played low, counting my last ten g's
Three weeks later, yo, I'm back in the P's

Gathering up information, checking faces
Keeping a forty-five auto' loaded like it was bases
When it get dark, venom will leave my mark (over)
I heard a voice through a bullhorn, a white man he said ""Yo, Starks!""
You're surrounded, put down your gun, look at the rules
There's nothin' but cops, nigga, you better not run""

[Chorus]

Yeah, you see how that went right?
That episode got deep and all of that
Know what I mean? Then it just go on and
It just don't stop, I don't care what town you from
What hood you from, it just all goes in, yo, check this episode

11:40 A.M. in the best Western
I'm with my bat, blew her ass back and chest in
Slob my knob, yeah no question, this my main bat
She thorough like that, so we don't use protection
But the night before, my wiz must of check my phone
How the fuck she get the codes, I don't know

Next thing, she laying in the hotel lobby, spotted me
Tipping the doorman, holding hands with my bitch besides me
My heart drop, everything stops, scared to death
Told my broad to keep it moving, cause I just got knocked
Don't turn around, as soon she did, she bust a shot
Plus she talk, security drop when she touch the glock
I had the gum-face on, long face on
Didn't say shit, not even cough or spit, my bitch was gone
There goes the car, house, rhyme boats or jewelry
Court date judges, my shorty tried to screw me

[Chorus: x2]

You see, sometime it don't pay
What goes around comes around in
In many different ways and
You can guess what happened
That's right y'all, you know how it get down
If anybody got it locked, it's God, that's right

",Last Night (Skit)
Ghostface Killah,"You got it (baby)
You got it (uh-huh)

Her name was Kim, this light skinned girl from Shaolin
Stood by my side when my world was caved in
She cooked for me, fix me up, plus made me happy
Every time she told me she loved me, I said ""no"" back
Since I was fucked up in the game, migraines
No honey in pockets, all I had was the change
Forty-five feelings, they got the beef
I through the heat to my dome
She said ""If you shoot, you ain't the real Pretty Tone""
Baby, come home, you not alone, be strong whether right or wrong
Our bond is even more stronger when the night is gone
Say, ""Yo, Starks relax, you know I got the hot water running
Baby, oiled down, pots in the oven""
And my lovin'? It's gone when they style old fashion
And, a, don't worry bout that jam, you gonna smash 'em
Whose asking, your still has come
Stay focused, keep it cool, you know I love you
Love you too, babe, thank you

(you out there) you got it (louder)

The more I drowned, the more down he went
As if to say, them other chicks wasn't meant
When she came through, by every square inch possible
Help the kid get on out, every obstacle
Long talks at night, arguments and still try'nna solve
Whether who is right, we mad tight
And the way she, never call the cops on a nigga
Got me, open, even more on her with her bangin' body
My favorite sweetheart, cum, but don't ever stop
Your love, give me every drop, you kiss get's me very hot
Never felt feelings before, and felt so sure
Every time you put it on me, I fiend for more
Think that's the reason why, can't leave, can't lie
Look you dead in the eye
Word to fuck up, like Ralph, baby, your the greatest
I'mma sell my guns, and with the cash I'mma bring you to Vegas

You got it
I was down in the sea of love
Going down to a clear cloud
You came and saved me dear (saved me) (Ghostface!)
It's too bad you didn't do it, I ain't never been used to it
The way we stopped them, dear (stopped them dear)

To all the ladies who love they man
Though they fuck up, and you still let them back in
Make some noise if you cook and you clean for 'em
Out of love, doing juks for them
To all my ladies who love a girl with good brains on 'em
Baggin' to get your name tattooed on 'em
Kiss 'em in the morning, hold 'em, definitely show 'em
We got our crab down, packed when it's time to mold 'em

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh,
(you out there) you got it (louder)
I was down, thank you",Save Me Dear
Ghostface Killah,"""Take me back, take me back, take me back."" [Repeats]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, hey yo you brought me on Jerry just to take you back
After that bullshit you put me through a couple months back
That wasn't right, call the cops on me, and told them I had it like
""Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns""
Check for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know
Three of his niggas got life, he use to roll with
And told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star
Once I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard
You bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back
That could never happen, I'm sorry
No disrespect, but you a psycho, honey
Got that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny
Shrimp's every night, ordering steaks
Them jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight
And when you told me your Merlo, need more grapes
I said ""Honey, you never had wine before!""
And if you did, that's not how you act at all
And no... that's not how we rock in Theodore

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah (Jacki-O)]
Please, babe, I love you
(Take me back, I'll never do it again)
Always want you
(You know that you my lover and my best friend)
Yes, darling, it's true
(Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on)
Please, babe, I want you

[Jacki-O]
Back to them days, when the yay' was bein' frontin' to you
Hundred thousand dollar shopping sprees wasn't nothin' to you
When three was a crowd, but I dealt with it
And your sex wasn't wild, but I dealt with it
I always felt shitted, you should of take me back
The girl that introduced you to boy, and helped you open your stacks
I got you in South connects, for the hard grind
That's why I took mine off the top, for the hard time
You know you need me in the streets, to help you run things
And if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings
I'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do
I know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two
I know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue
But the way I chew on you, you should of got me two
Now you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on
Tell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog
Who loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O
Cook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat
What you actin' for? Get back in the door
Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you
Even the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume
Promise never curse you, I want you in my circle
Honey right by my side where I keep my herbals
We both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal
The man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you
Mother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you
Then damn, I might as well leave, 'cause I don't deserve you
Watch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you
Fiendin' from the magic wand, when she 'nique and serve you
Take me please, take me with ease
Take me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees
'Member the first time you made my key
You was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd
I miss shit like that, and all of the times
We played cops, I'll arrest you in bed
Police brutality, I'll leave the side of your ass red
God damn it, is sex for real girl? Girl, we in special ed
Fuck that, take me back, pretty please, with you on top

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo this goes for everybody all across the world
Whether you got fired or your lover dropped you and all that
You know what I'm sayin'? Everybody want to get tooken back
You know what I mean? Don't be afraid to ask, if you want to see,
Yo, take me back, fuck it, everybody want to get tooken back and shit
This is your man, Big Ghost, your host, signing off and shit

Ghostface Killah,"[ Missy Elliott]
This that fire! Ghostface and Missy

[Ghostface Killah]
Somebody tell that girl that her ass too big
I give it to her right and she let me live
Can't eat that, 'cause there's no relationship
I beat that, the next day you called in sick
Frontin', not for nothin', I pop buttons
Off Baby Phat, Levi's, J.Lo's, Guess and Gap
Cause it's like that, young lady, bet I make you shake
Like the Puffy and Jay-Z's, Dre's and J.D.'s
Come on, if not you, I'ma beat this song
But if you were bout it, our business wouldn't be here this long
Let me break it down for you, all I wanted to know
If I could just feel it and touch it, and break it down into numbers and
Come with me and just leave your friends
Cause we don't need no cock blocking
Tellin' you this without no option
Tell your friends ""Peace, look, I'm bouncin'""

[Chorus: Missy Elliott (Ghostface Killah)]
Tush, tush, tush
Want to slide in the bush, bush, bush?

Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
You want to get up in my tush, tush, tush?
You could slide in the bush, bush, bush

Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
You want to get up in that tush, tush, tush?
Want to slide in my bush, bush, bush

Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)

[Ghostface Killah]
Oh yeah, you jinglin' baby (well let me jump up on that ding-a-ling baby)
Ooh, gosh, you a nasty girl, sassy
Picture me layin' you inside my classic pearls
Toes'll curl, giddy up, you go girl
I'm about to, uh, do it slow girl
Ooh, you in control, it's in your world
She on, I think I like ol' girl
Take it out, turn around
Charlie horse, shit, threw me off balance
Wildin', all I wanted was to show you my talent
To let you know on how I rep in Staten Island
This is the reason I came to you
So we can connect it then kick it was the thing to do
Cause we don't need no representation
Domination, got them waitin' patient

[Ghostface Killah]
Now this is the way y'all suppose to
To get down, y'all ain't right
Somebody say ""Aha! Ghost is back!""

[Missy Elliott]
Pull back the curtain, let me work your sermon
Playboy don't hurt me like a virgin
You seem real determined to put a hurtin'
But if you ain't slurpin', then you better off jerkin'
You got a lot of nerve, to want to serve my curves
My 36D, 36 hips
The way I shoot the gift, I swallow coke bottles
And you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips
Eh, I really like you baby
Do you know how to wife this lady?
Give me what I want, don't talk, don't touch
Unless you got a bank account that make my face blush
Now shush, in my bush
And I can give you what you want, make a whoosh
Just throw it, I'll show you how to push
Kinky sex, tie ropes around your wrist
Come on

Come on, 
Come on

Look at the Sun, so pretty today it's so bright and so smashin'
Blastin', helps out the grass and
Smile when its mornin' time, last night I wrote 3 rhymes
I woke up to the see the Sun shine and
God is my witness in scriptures and pictures
The Sunkist scrumptous, son its nutritious
It makes me wanna climb, take a bite out of shine
""This little light of mine, of mine, of mine""
Yo, the Sun could never be pussy, he always come out
He'll stand right there, even if you pull ya gun out
He can never run out, when the lights go out
It's Japan's turn now, the Earth had spun around
I see yellow and green, its a beautiful thing,
The sky is blue cuz the Sun hit the water like bling
A reflection (uh-huh), and thats all it is (word)
You can't stare at him long cuz your face will do like this

Look who shinnin' again (oh my my my)
We been rhymin' again (oh my my my)
Eye's be blindin' the men (oh my my my)
We come through time and time again (oh my my my)

[Raekwon (Slick Rick)]
Check out my nephew
He jumped up in the window just to see you
Look what he drew, a car-house, always wants to be with you
He's just as jolly, he's always beggin' me to let him see you
I'm like, ""probably if you clean up and read a little""
You make people eyes glow,
you got the Weather Channel buggin', and you stuborn when it snow
You my mentor, mothers name they kids after you
New slang, nothin' personal, we knowin' what you been through
(Sun) You roll like one in a million yo
(Sun Sun) You always find like one in the buildin' yo
We'd owe us babies from day one
All I had was you on my birthday, baby think you owe me one
The way the world look when you around
Prisioners get out, look up grin at you, and then kiss the ground
You my favorite, I wish we had 3 more of you
I adore you, plus I even wrote a story for you

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick]
How a diverse Sun, can be enrichenin' and cruel
Reachin' the full 98, and got the kids in the pool
Isn't it cool how it spreads joy, hun's lay in it
and it's hard to go back to work, when your lunch break's finished
Ah strike and I fought, so it's a fact I support
Feelin' the warm sunrays, upon your back as you walk
The heat driven, a theory I clung to deep with it
Is souls have to go through the Sun to reach heaven and
Sense and retreat, our souls battered to seek
Madam believe since dinosaurs, and Adam and Eve
That Sun's hovered to the extermination of us
It's a peephole which leads to the firmament above us

Y'nah mean? It's real motherfuckin' shit, you know

Yo, making moves back and forth uptown

Whip smelling like fish from 125th

Back seat with my leg all stiff
Push the fuckin' seat up, tartar sauce on my S Dot kicks
Rocks is lit while I'm poppin' the clips

Got the Montana pulled in front of the store
Made my usual gun check, safety off, come on Frank

She keep a shottie cocked in the hallway
Damn she look pretty old Ghost, she work for Kevin, she 'bout seventy seven
She paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses' wedding

These fuckin' maricons on the couch watchin' Sanford and Son
Passin' they rum, fried plantains and rice
Big round onions on a T-bone steak, my stomach growling yo I want some
Hold on, somebody's comin', get behind me, knocked at the door
Act like you stickin' me up, put the joint to my face
Push me in quickly when the bitch open up
Remember you don't me, blast him if he reach for his gun
Yo who goes there? Tony, Tony one second homie
No matter rain, sleet or snow you know you suppose to phone me
Off came the latch, Frank pushed me into the door
The door flew open, dude had his mouth open
Frozen, stood still with his heat bulgin'
Told him Freeze! lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment
Frank snatched his gat, slapped him, axed him
Where's the cash, coke and the crack? Get the smoke and you fast
His wife stood up speakin' in Spanish, big tittie bitch holdin' the cannon
Ran in the kitchen, threw a shot, then kicking the four fifth
Broke a bone in her wrist and she dropped the heat
Give up the coke! But the bitch wouldn't listen
I'm on the floor like holy shit! Watching my man Frank get busy
He zoned out, finished off my man's wiz
He let the pitbull out, big head Bruno with the little shark's teeth chargin'
Foamin' out the mouth, I'm scared
Frank screamin', blowin' shots in the air
Missin' his target, off the Frigidare, it grazed my ear
Killed that bullshit pit, ran to the bathroom butt first
Frank put two holes in the doorman's Sassoon
The coke's in the vacuum, got to the bathroom, faced his bad moves
The big one had the centipede stab wound
Frank shot the skinny dude, laid him out
The bigger dude popped Frankie boy, played him out

Ghostface Killah,"Standing at the bus stop
I heard a voice behind me saying, ""Hi, baby""
Ohh, I just fell all apart inside
Because I hadn't heard that voice in such a long time
I turned around

That's right y'all, y'all shoulda seen what I did
So, so pretty, so pretty, y'all hear how she sounds right?
She sounds crazy right? Yes
This what happened at the bus stop

She turned around and this grown lady said, ""Hi""
I was quite stunned from the way she replied
Peace, nice to meet ya, sweetie call me Tony Starks
Ghost if you like ta, mind if invite ya
Over for some red wine, nice Barry White

She pulled out a cigarette, hon', here's a lighter
Her voice was a slow jam, full length white mink
Hella fine with a beauty mark on her right cheek
When she spoke her smoke floated when it left her throat
Spelled honey when she blew it out it turned to water word
I was infatuated

She put the perfume to her neck and sprayed it
Plus the bottle was nickel plated
It make a young girl steez, yo, feel outdated
And know the married chicks shopping with they man's hated
One stone on her finger was green, Maybeline
Cover Girl lipstick, plump color fingertips
Revlon face blush, oh-five-six, shit

The ashes was hangin' off her stog' so she flicked it
Damn, had to bundle up, I call goosebumps
Plus the wind chill factor had dropped, here the bus come
I never rush one, here take my number miss
I live alone, her face fell when I dropped the chrome

We run the city

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Niggaz got to die, if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid
... if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid

We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Layin on the bed, lookin like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo
All I heard was Frank Lexi get the raw

Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holdin the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the mornin, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawlin, cause Tony for the stallin
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggaz)
Workin out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners
I got them big spenders comin through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga

Hey yo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
Cause I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you
You'se a bird you know that, giving that man
Ten points, like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it, to him
Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'sucker, you know me'
Stop fronting for them people out, side like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'ma holla at dog
And rip his head off, words of a song

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Hey yo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses
And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a brother went to war, vests banged up
Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you

Shorty what is you thinking bout
Didn't I put you down
Flyest whips, rollin' round like yea
That's the bosses chick, on the side
I might of had, one or two
Them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, tryin' to get revenge
That's what you just don't do

I'm a good dude, you see, yeah,
Females out there that wanna be

[sniffing]
Yea, it was them cute pretty bitches that was smelling like coke
They kept going [egh egh] like they had shit in they throats
They had stacks on the tables, cables
I had to say it was like early May a few days 'til my birthday date, baby date
I'll play to the sucker DJ, lookin' like Enrique
Told him to throw in that Supreme Cliee-ente
He said just gave a nod with a thumbs up wink
I just put down my dollar bill, took off my mink
Bartenders know me big spenders, gave us those monster drinks
Sent us ? and cigars that stink
Playing them oldie but goodie classics, them honies had fat asses
Noses runnin' from the raw, they hid behind they glasses
Toney with the Montana, I came to play
With my long fingernail, yo honey you should pass that yay
Let me see what color you got boo, I got that beige
I see y'all from the perihperals? ladies far right from the stage
I'm thirty-three, I look twenty-six with big furs on
What y'all inherent the Santa Maria? y'all money that long?
Your father must have fell back when y'all started fucking
You asked me what I think about dude? I say fuck him
And this one bitch called me Fat Albert
The way my pockets had the mumps you know that Ghost is 'bout it
Then I asked these young ladies do they buff helmets
They said fuck you, took a sniff and then they didn't tell me
Just because you left home, this is Tone...Yo you see I flip stones
Birthstone, you ain't grown fuck around and get boned
Peerage pretty young ladies lost at six, Gucci kicks
And they picky when it come to they dick
If y'all ladies was all mine I'd teach you well
Free tales, sweet smells, slee? well hear bells
Before you sleep read your books like it was mah fanmail
And when you wake ? you woman the whole world can tell
Word life, put you to school when the clubs'll stop
College girl, pay for your books at 200 a pop
And all I ask in life's for you to be careful
Stay focused, take care of your health
Have kids and marry a prince
Good luck and happiness
And no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow
The sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow
And maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library
You got the right conversation, education, and looks
With the right intelligence to stay away from them crooks
Baby get on your feet, be an acocuntant, doctor, lawyer or nurses's aid
Computer wizard, you about to get paid...

[Outro, over background singing]

Yea...
You know I just met y'all
And I love y'all already and all that
But I gotta get off that nose candy
To make it in life and all that shit...
That's why I'm here
I'm like a father figure and all that shit
I let y'all get high, and that's all you're going to do but...

You wanted to be a fighter (Yeah!)
You wanted to be a killer (New York Stand Up)
You wanted to be the Champ! (Got your boy in the booth nigga)

My gun get hard wit a 45 still erects and eagle on
Kangol hat slanted coconut bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock yo
Niggaz want me dead but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy
When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Jaws is hanging

Bird ass nigga resemble Keenon Ivory Waynes
Stay in your place dirt born rappers get Shadow box for training ?
Ya'll still eatin bacon

Think nobody can; don't give this nigga no statue give him death
I told y'all I wasn't going away
You had your shot no give me mine
Now why don't you tell these folks why you been ducking me, politics man
You think you going to keep me down

Because I'm not a puppet like that fool up there
Ask his woman she get more pipe from the plumber than in bed
I'm the Champ!

I like the deuce of diamonds cutting spades on a glass table
Half a mil on my left ankle
Terry cloth Guess shorts robes is comfortable
Bring me a nice bitch that means I'll fuck with you
My swagger is Mick Jaeger stones is rolling
Prestige is cut to it tis ? spark when weed went up
The Cocoa leaf is slightly damp
Sprouting in the backyard next to Gran duke tomato plants
And jets get charted marquee shit with the cars on it
They head and they earl to the toilet and vomit
Back East summer MC king since Cuban
Pretty Tone Iron Man and Bulletproof and Supreme
Proof and you double deuce in the jeans

Listen I am bad, I said I am bad
I'm a bad man
I'm so bad sometimes I's scare myself
Sometimes I look in the mirror and want to kiss myself I'm so pretty

Ghostface Killah,"Ah-yo
Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-a** big brains and straight out the hood

[Ghostface]
Yo,
Ah-yo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong

Right before she went to rest she had me singin this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
I don't know

She had the high-glow's switchin
See her in the club you hear others chicks b****in
But Dawn quit to bust a b**** a** and s***
See she did 12 months over a ratchet

Not no crab s***
Got bagged with the mag
Taxi cab s***
Clit was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it

It was cla**ic
Nowadays she's laid back
Helpin me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat

Wife everything
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Lickin gla** bowls in her cat clothes
'Cause crazy stacks

Finicky thing
Her kittin drink pollar spring
Take naps
Near her jewerly box

She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
Caramel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode

Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN

[Cappadonna]
Ah-yo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn
Holdin my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes

That's why I'm eatin her candy
And suckin her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like what's goin on

On some marvin gay s*** like lets get it onnnnn
Sugar
Let's get it on
Ah-yo she a diamond in the rough

Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
F*** cookin for me
She stash me out when the feds come lookin for me

I'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creepin on her
She right there when it gets sticky

She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side

Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
Plus her guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting

Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue louis vetton
Leg muscles, deep dimples

Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet peitete a** nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin the food warm while I'm gone

It won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'

Ah-yo, ah-yo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue

Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
A** off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up

Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!
'Cause she my b****, the only cat that I lick

Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh

Get away from the stove, nigga
Stop playin' man, the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?

I'm in the crib watchin' Larry King Live
The new Guccis on refrigerator, smokin' some kush
This nigga's a lighter swisher, becomin' a roach
Go get the glass ashtray, pour the glass of Crut
Tap the bottle then toast

Barrie took a sip for the cause, yeah my son
Soon to be three, tried to fill his bottle then run
Then I got a collect call, heard niggaz down the block is fightin'
Some nigga got, knifed up brawlin'

Heard the kid was nineteen, Lil' Infinity too
His father worked up at the dealer, he loved boo
They tried him for his Louis', son wasn't havin' it though
Yeah, yeah, my nigga, the color of glue

Decided on a intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga
This is like out of the blue
I'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain
Proceeded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap

Think I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed
Fucked up my writing hand, that's my check
Now I wanna kill this lil' nigga true
Only thing that stop my gun flamin' 'cause he related to you

Who? He ain't related to me
Just that I knew him for like eighteen years until he violated
Stealin' my gear
If my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me

Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me
Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbin' all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance when the heat is on

Stapleton days, shoot himself in the groin'
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holdin' his nuts
Screamin' ""God damnit, shit I put one in my balls""

What the fuck y'all lookin' at me for?
Call the police, do somethin'
Motherfuckers standin' around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red

I said chill that's fam duke
He put real work in that make you cute, fuck that
But anyway, son, indeed, he stole two Polo rugbies
Swore to his dead mother, I couldn't take it

Yo, Lord, I knocked out his teeth
Now he's rockin' those false joints like everything's peace
",R.A.G.U.
Ghostface Killah,"Yo, aiyo, I'm lost underwater, I see a pink dog with a crystal handle
So I keep swimmin', amazed that I'm not drownin'
Butterflies took control when I arrived
I opened the door, no, I knocked first

I'm not on my turf, I seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks
Some mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashin' they tail
Like follow me, now, don't be afraid

I'ma show you where all the jinns and spirits pray
If you scared to face this life, you shouldn't stay
So, I kept on swimmin', grabbed on to her fin to help me out

As we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out
Then she asked me politely what I'm thinkin' about
I said nuttin', she said nuttin' leaves nuttin'
If you fill me up, bet this'll bring that out

I seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus
Jellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook
Pearls on the mermaid girls
Gucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world

Up ahead lies Noah's Ark but that's waves away
And way to the right, that's one of our bangin' spas
She quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe
Bangin' the Isleys, he slow backed up

Then he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein' me hard
He got vexed and smacked his boo
Took off, continued my travels, seen a rock from the Titanic
Lookin' fat and, nah, it wasn't damaged

Then I seen somethin' real big, sky blue and gold
With white walls, behind a large city
That was lost before Christ walked the walk
Upon the waters that's so bright

Every time we got close the mermaid held on tight
All I heard was ""Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
Bismillah are-Rahman, are-Raheem?, Allah screamed
That we heard from afar

Everyone salat and the world's banginest mosque got crowded in
With life that I can't explain
They said sir, yes, I'm glad you came
Greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs
Prayed after that we said, ?Amen?

The kid like 5 or 6 shit I will curse back
I got it from the older folks sittin in the living room
Everybody had cups stylistic song boom
But then came Darryl Mack lightin' all the reefer up
Baby caught a contact I'm trying to tie my sneaker up
I'm missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes
It feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these afros
Soon as I thought I was good the joke's on me
I heard a voice ""get in the room, I get angry""
Sting my feet catch a tantrum
Spit, scream, fuck that
Momma shake me real hard, then get the big gat
That's called the belt help me as I yelled
I'm in the room like (panting)""huh, huh, huh"" with mad welps

Get beat, then I'd run and tell grandman ""mama hit me for no reason""
She whipped me hard when I finished eatin
And felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed
Hid my drawers and start cryin, when she felt that bed
Caught another when I told her those the fake pro-keds
In the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head (ahHH!)
Nowadays kids don't get beat, they get big treats
Fresh pair of sneaks, punishments like have a ceas
Back then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass
And bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash
That's back to back beatings

Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels

I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried til there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything, just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'm handle what God gave me, cuz I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on

Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should of stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones
You left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
Cause I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever
So I'ma open the cage and set my butterfly free
Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me

In the crib, with my wiz, getting my grown man on
Listening to classic soul, with the slow jams on
Smokey Robinson, Tears of a Clown, shedding tears
Popping beers, almost twenty five years in the town
I seen niggas die off, like dandelions in the fall
Niggas heard of Chip Banks and left him lying in the hall
Your boy Sandy Brock was ill, like Kobe Bryant with the ball
It's no exceptions, even the biggest giants gotta fall
Cause we living in denial, but these lessons are vital
When marinating in the slums, you gotta practice survival
Now everybody wants to be next American idol
But these are more than just songs pressed up your vinyl

But we all can't green, knahImean?

But first, we gotta save our spoons

Even if I didn't like it, every scrap on my plate got chewed
Either you ate, or you didn't eat, the memories are bitter sweet
Used to get teased by my friends, cause I had bigger feet
I think about them jokes and laugh, crack a smile
Cause as a child, I never knew that being broke was bad
Growing up I was close to my dad, but that still didn't stop a nigga
From putting that coke in them bags
That was the past, now, I'm riding with the oak in the dash
Got jealous niggas hating, big time, hoping I crash
I can't blame 'em, and on the same note, I can't change 'em
Let a nigga disrespect my shit, I'm gonna flame 'em
That's word to my son little Jay, my little homey
Ask niggas how your boy get down, ain't nothing phony

[Chorus]

Yeah, they say two heads are better than one, and in the process
I learned that slow progress, is better than none
That's why I'm still here pursuing my goals, baking that bread
In the bakery, if I ain't out, doing no shows
I hit the block, once in a blue, and front with the crew
And show niggas a good time, by getting drunk in the stud'
Some niggas find happiness, with a blunt and a brew
They talented niggas, but they just need something to do
It's kinda hard try'nna look beyond buildings and bricks
We can't condone broken homes, when our children is sick
Tryina' survive off the cereal and milk from the WIC
And all the good ones we got, be getting killed in the mix
He could of been the next Jordan, who knows, the next Emmit
Young Tiger Woods, or the new Arthur Ashe of tennis
That's why I'm looking past the gimmicks, getting cash with Dennis
Criminal grind, we gonna smash the business

Why I would damage you, fuck, if I drink, then ran with you
Ya'll chose to war, so called rich niggaz wanna verse the poor
I'll rob you first, then go to your earth, it's not gon' hurt
If you try calling the cops, it's not gon' work
All you gotta do is lay in the dirt, we dug a hole
And my guns weight more, yo, then Gerald Levert
With more blubber than a Ruben Studdard, I grease the pan
With rhymes, and ya'll can't believe it's not butter
I told ya'll to chill, stretch all out like franks on the grill
With a classic deal, I'm like a farmer when I'm playing the field
Just painting my seeds, in 20-06, it's time to build

Opened up her legs, like ""ooh, I smell fish""
Yeast infection, queen, she love dick
Shivlered up tits, she'll bang the whole Knicks
Now how can I salute you, kid, I'm planning to do you
Crucial, blow rugers at who you with
We bump heads while we out in the street, it's all good
My trigger fingers'll matter, kick the back of your feet
And your red monkey jeans, is looking like a scene from Baghdad
That's bad, flags red, dirt beds
Ya'll niggaz is eating, crystal meth' heads
We pissed out, wrist out, with the best threads
Knockin' niggaz off, knockin' niggaz out

I must've passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out
Three more niggas approachin' holdin' they macs out
One spoke, gave me the keys to a boat, reached in his trenchcoat 
And pulled out a yellow envelope
Which contained twenty thousand in cash, 
A photograph of a Colombian nigga with a long mustache Miguel Sanchez, 
Keep a gun hidden in his pants' leg with armed bodyguards, 
Surveillance around his land spread
He runs a billion dollar organization under investigation, 
Plus he's wanted by immigration
Now I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement, 
How the fuck I get involved with these federal agents? 
They knew my background, knew about what happened out in Sac-town, 
They knew about the rap down South, they laid the facts down
Said I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel, 
Or spend the rest of my life in prison
A classified mission on some James Bond shit, 
007-style up against some straight convicts
Now I'm pondering, thoughts wandering, 
Got my girl on the phone, tell her to kiss little J, 
Cause I'll be gone again ""Honey I can't speak."" she suckin' her cheek, 
""If everything go good baby I'll be home in a week.""
Pinchin' myself just to see if I'm dreaming, 
Call up my team and meet me by the docks in Miami, 
I fly out this weekend

I got you nigga, 4-4 pop two niggas, 
That druglord that we want got a spot for niggas, 
And if we kill him, it's back to the block my nigga, he carry Rugers, 
34 shots I figure He only holla at the kid when there's money involved, 
They pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all
But me and Trife doin' right together, 
Got no choice but give us ten, like we sellin' white together, 
Left side 4-5 right black Beretta, takin' trips overseas flippin packs for better, 
Every flight a hundred stacks and better so grind hard, get your money up, get on your grillies, don't mind odds Fuck a cop car, throw on some chumpers and try drop charge, 
Hit the block hard It's kinda hard being G-O-D, 
If he owe Trife, he owe me, load up the mac rounds, 
M-I-A, call that the Jack-Town
Tell niggas I'm on my way, comin' back down, 
Miguel Mr. Sanchez, it's a wrap now Theodore extortin' your shit, 
Handin' out packs now, I used to listen to 50 and jam Back Down, 
Now I sling 50 kilos where I'm at now, 50 a wop, 
Purple top, nigga I'm back, clown, Cristal bottles, 
Grey Goose for the chat lounge, Channel 7 News, older dude murdered, gat found",Miguel Sanchez
Ghostface Killah,"This is why the World Series of Poker
Is decided over a no limit poker tournament
Players, pro's even, can't handle the pressure of the game
They consider no limit the only pure game left

We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean pokerface
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top

You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut

It was a late Saturday night, big chips, we had a lotta
Theodore performed at the Plush Brigatta
It was an hour in, big chip leader of the game
Caught pocket jacks and flopped two more of the same

Looking at quads, waiting for someone to bluff
So I checked 'til someone said I had enough
I'm raising a thousand, son I pay to see the river
Caught an ace and his face, was a straight up giver

He had three now, must of caught two in the hole
A full boat, I'm about to sink ship, tell him to fold
He laughs, raises his fifty G's, please I need chip count
The pit boss, swear I flip over, you gon' flip out

I'm all in, here to win, I rep Staten Island
He called it, I showed four jacks, he started wilding
This son of **** all night, he set me up
He check, check, he trapped me

We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean pokerface
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top

You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut

It was a cash game, 100 200 dollar table
Me and Johnny Mack sitting, God willing and able
July 23rd and 4th, the lions is out
It's the month of the Leo, we gon' win with no doubt

Bunch of high rollers, laughing like he know we're low in the amateurs
I buy him for the ****, twenty G's, I'mma damage ya
Couple of chuckles, broken glasses, all tinted
I'mma put y'all all on tilt, give me a minute

So I check raise 'em, bluff 'em, ain't showing my cards
Two four off two, y'all ain't no superstars
I should of been at the table, World Series of Poker
I'm up 80 G's already, y'all a bunch of jokers

Now they all on tilt, raising, I call 'em all in
With pocket three's, for 80 G's, I'm ready to fall in
Flop two aces, caught my three on fourth street
A four hundred thousand dollar pot boy, life's sweet

We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean pokerface
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top

You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot

Ghostface Killah,"Sun God get 'em

I stay far from my opponents, pardon me dogs
That's why lead the call, they moving up on us
But them G's on the corners, move when I move
That's a warning, or I'mma have my goons spin a garment

Think it's sweet, and try to creep or run up on us
They get deeper than twelve foot, and you be leaking out of order
Don't beef, if you ain't beefin' for no quarters
'cause pain is money, you float funny when you surfin' the water

I'm that dude slangin' pack by the border
I love my life, I live it twice, 'cause it's up to me sorta
You a fool with a mental disorder, and it's probably your daughter
That really love me, for the **** that I taught her

Will Smith on the guest list, pops is the king
I'm the fresh prince, forty oil tune, kick ya chest in
Us that got the universe confession, pardon your dame
I'm new to the game, but true to my lessons

Jeans, hoods, ****, ****

Visions of me swallowing ****, being chased by jake
And the sound of the razor keep hitting the plate
And tooters is flab with ****, with **** and them jeans
We chew through it, like we coming down off ****

And my P.O., she half Creole, I move from Philly to Dallas
With true talent, like my name is T.O.
So when I ****, I gotta **** slow, she know I kick them Vasine bottles
'cause if I'm dirty, I ain't letting it go

Your project steps is Ajax down, dry blood
Maintenance men with the scrub brush, scraping the ground
Diapers, baby rattles and broke lighters, I led many
Horses to water, just to see if they like it

Taste my, Betty Crock', ready rock, bet he cock, now
News flash, my **** ridin' L, laid a cop down
Any of ya **** want beef, I will stop clowns
I got a bad ox' fifth, now how the **** sound?

Jeans, hoods, guns ****

Aiyo, what up S.G.? Aiyo, what's poppin' my ****
I'm just oil in the ****, exercising my trigger
Finger, I've got the biggest ****, yeah, I got a crispy stainless
Your mans ain't **** those hoes, they just a bunch of gamers

Them head shots, neck shots, probably blow they brains in
I'm so close to the edge, pushin' they **** face in
I bet you now, them mutha**** really start complaining
No hesitation, my reputation'll leave 'em chaining

We go hard, like the NARC's when we start invading
I copped the license and registration, to cock and aiming
It's all entertainment and all my **** made it
We hard body like Wu-Tang and Iron Maiden

I keep the **** blazing, hands hurt
Like a **** when she putting braids in, I think it's so amazing
We ran **** for hours, up in the Days Inn
Hood rats and **** motels, we seen baking

Jeans, hoods, guns, ****

Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood

Damn, this is for all my women that's been going through the struggle
On welfare, living the rough life (oh I cried, but see I'm thankful)
It's gone be alright, that's right (Thankful for the trouble
For holding me down, every day, oh yeah..)
This is how we gone do it, I want you to explain your story
Then I'mah tell you mine, tell 'em
(Uh, can't ask for any more.. more...)
Tell 'em Keyshia..

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Momma, where did you go wrong
Because I need to know
You got me living the life you were living
When you were young...
And I'm heading down the same path, uh
But the difference between me and you
Is, oh, hey, hey, hey

[Ghostface Killah]
There's not a difference, boo, it's real life..

It's not ya momma fault, it's ya fathers fault
It's your fathers fault your mother is an alcoholic
Confusin the brain from the booze and the pain
And plus he cheated on her, beated on her, smack dead in the rain
She Lost her first child in 74
And that lead to nervous breakdowns bicardi dark she downin it raw
She can't take it she constantly cryin fallin down on her knees
Like help me lord please I'm ready to leave
All she needed was somebody to rub her feet
Give her a nice hug and rescue her from off these streets, come on

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
There's not a difference, boo, it's only an 8-figure, back me up

I been sent by an angel to snatch you up
Take you way above the clouds and back you up
At night you can lay in my arms feel the heart beatin
Don status in the sheets I'm keepin you warm
Ain't no nigga gone do what I do
Imah take care of you and ya kids
Take the bent and go handle ya biz
The bills is paid,the cable back on
I quote you know the seeds want they nickleodeon on
I'm not ashamed to sport you
Floss you or gloss you out
Fat, skinny out of shape I'll dior you out

Wipe ya eyes..

Yo in the hood there's a struggle
My girls is in trouble
She lackin guidance in the mind she's blinded and puzzled
Her pops never showed her the ropes
Her moms raised mad kids on her own
She never had a strong man in her home

Stay stroooooooooong
Oh, hey, said we're gonna stay strong
No matter what
Yeah.. we're still here to see, hey... (that's my baby, that's my baby)

Aiyo, I'll die for the prophets and I'll die for the Lord
On the battlefield, wounded badly, holding a sword
With no questions asked, I already know, it's all for the cause
Just laying me facing the East, when I'm under the floor
I might've sinned in the process, from being, in the projects
Eyes swept from all the anger, that could've fucked with my conscience
And more or less, I'm a man of my word
My body is holding a couple scars on it, though I was never a bird

And my ancestors picking cotton (I'll die for you)
My close homies that get it popping (I'll die for you)

Aiyo, I'd die for my moms, and I'd die for my kids
If you, really my Queen, then I'd die for my whiz

Jump in front of a biscuit, snuff money with all of my mics
Or we can brawl it out and take his life
By taking his gun, no problem
Just make sure we eating when we on the run
Like slaves that's chained together, who killed master?
The dogs is coming, the pigs is gon' blast ya
I'd die for you, I'd die for my brother
Die for the babies who can't eat with bare feet who need they mother

First off, drunk, you not my peeps

Blew her a kiss, as I sat down, she smiled and winked
Stood up, grabbed my hand, what up, slid ya boy to the bedroom
Popped the suitcase, I'm in the lead room
This check was loaded, equipped, with fifths
Porcelain handles with horse back kicks, whispered
""You know what, Ghost, I do hits"" But niggas get fooled
By the sexyness, I'm a real gritty bitch

Double cokeheads who love cartoons, type chicks who eat pussy
Listen to Prince and play with they wombs
Flight attendant out of Delta Airline, get money girls
Travelled the world, only one did jail time
Jade, her father's a judge, same nigga in the O.J. case
When he tried on the glove, but uh, in this scenario, four A.M.
The bars closed, now we at it again
Drunk nigga, come out I'm popping mad shit, he's past it
Nancy Drew, drew out her purse, the blue steel ratchet
Didn't even say shit, she blasted, barrel smoking
Shot the Henny out his hand for laughing
These are my bitches, Nancy and Jade
Natural born killas be letting they guns blaze... god damn!

Look she tired of the same old basic, let's face it
This is how she wants to be laced, I'm raping it
Anywhere, I'm taking it, she loving how the gangsta flex
This is thug sex, Iking it, nasty talk
As she liking it, spanking it, she biting the sheets
She's a freak, my view from the embassy suites
Is off the beach shore, Dirty would've love you, mami
'You like it raw?' A tear drop, fucking you slow
I see your knees knock, your love is so sweet
If I switch beats, and hit you with angles, you might breathe
You know the Godbody make healthy wise seeds
You, plus a glass of weed, is all he need
You could travel so far, look, maybe book a flight to Mars
To escaping at, one forty two?
They take Jet Blue for two, into Long Beach
Rain lifted whipping the port, from when I touch
Look something nice up in the stash, hit a Dutch

Spread the honey, big head inside the Humvee
Mix lead inside my lungies, spend bread on my Dungarees
And such and such, Ghost plugged me with this slut
Don't hug me, bug me, I'm ugly when I fuck
I'm hard like a jungle hunter, bust off in Heather

Pullin' up mad slow blunted, passin' police cars
I saw one two three bodies
Blood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter
That's the work of a tommy
But then I heard it was the work of a mami
Spanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag
Kinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick
She love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick
That's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop
Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot
Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition
Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness
So then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards

Peace Lord, how your physical?

Gotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall
Dope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball
They talkin' about killin' ya man's and them
That kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin
Yo that's my heart Tone; yea yea he killed the captain
What nationality nigga? The kid was Latin
It happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan
I was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne?

Yo, Ghostface, go in heavy, man, let's do it

[Chorus 1: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth ""I Just Want to Celebrate"" sample)]

(I just want to celebrate) Like we bangin on New Years Eve yall
(I just want to celebrate) Like we just beat trial
(I just want to celebrate) We hype for just bein here

[Ghostface Killah]
Stones on every arm, the crib is ten million
The corks from Dom Perignon can't reach my ceiling
Four maids with four grenades
When the sun's in my face, all I do is lower the walls for shade
The pool's a pain in the ass, fifty grand on Windex kid
They keep it clean the whole bottom is glass
So you can see the sharks and piranhas, a pair of pajamas
That's my neighbor, the faggot disrespecting my mama
No cars in the garage, it's underground shit
They way the floor open up you think I'm hiding spaceships
French chefs, the best grapes on they breath
Louie aprons on the Yank cats, the puffy cooks the rest
Besides I got birds that never leave the nest
They fuck with me, I'll watch em confess, then I'll go rest
Get back up deposit them checks
Muthafuckas fuckin up a good time by snappin your necks, come on

[Chorus 2: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth sample)]
(I just want to celebrate) Like my baby's first steps you heard

Money for everybody, candy to the kids

Mansion parties for all star weekend in my L.A. crib
We can to party, run out of Goose we got Dollies
Shorties wettin me, check out her body, uhh
Throw up your hands like it's your birthda, mommy
Let's celebrate, now I got her girlfriends behind me
Now I'm in the middle, watch is all chiseled
I can holla at the birds like Dr. Dolittle
(What's that in your pocket Ghost?) a Dill pickle
(Not that) oh that's the forty-five stainless nickel

On the floor who look right in them jeans
If you fat, I might take one for the team
But I gotta get drunk first knowhatimean, come on

[Chorus 3: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth sample)]

Na-na-na-na-nah, you can't catch me
I'm out like Thomas in, in a five-fifty
Police be fiendin to frisk me
I'm so legit I walk away with the car keys pissy
Back at the labo, shorty wop need a Dutch
He fuckin wit a Goose dick, tonight I'ma beat it up
Your thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up
(That's how I get Ghost, especially when you eat it up)
My goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious
Move it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress
Ghost don't have no patience
I like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations
I'm, definitely not lookin for love
But if you give it to me right now I might say I was
You can chill if you want I got crazy bud
But before we do what it do, go jump in the tub, come on

They ain't gotta do nothing, but just search them bitches
Let's go...

[Ghostface Killah]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
This is a stick up, I want y'all to lift y'all skirts
I mean shirts, take ya hoodies off, jackets and watches
Before you put ya hands on the wall, empty ya pockets
Fix ya face, this a robbery, nigga, respect the juks
Stop shaking, you making me nervous, I know that you shook
The fuck is that sticking out from under ya foot?
Move, turn ya head around, nigga, you better not look
Stacks, you hiding from Tone? I'll shake, rattle ya bones
You killed him! Nah, hit him with the back of the fucking chrome
In the dark, yo, I do this alone
That's the reason why I don't shake hands, in case I gave you a phone
That's a buck fifty, long hickey, when I strike I do it quickly
Creep up on my victims swiftly, make it hard for you to stick me
Cuz if we shoot it out, cuz if I die tonight you coming with me
Bitch-ass nigga, eat through ya chest like some fucking whiskey

BOY! Gut him like a pig in the dark
Or auction off ya bitch body parts

Get to sticking niggaz for the right prices
BOY! Yeah, this is priceless.. GET 'EM!

[Sun God]
Aiyo, I post up, packed the shotti
Black mags in lobbies, with red dots, to detach the body
If you a boss, why ya cash is sloppy?
This a Staten Island burglar gang, ock, not no Ave could stop me
I'm on the road, not no massive robbery
When it come to that dough, it over flow like paper bag tsunamis
I take shit, lumberjacks and Tommy's
Niggaz passing out bombs like Culpepper, so I pass behind 'em
My black glove, black mask, requirements
Sent the order to Trife Dies', and he gon' send 'em fast, they flying in
These cowards couldn't clash our lion's den
That forty-four mag'll twist ya aves and the cav you flying in
We hoping out cabs like Iron Men
It's hard to believe how niggaz leave with no bag supplying sense
Empty cuz my staff is hiring
Canine dogs with felonies duck fast when firing

[Trife Da God]
Aiyo, we carry arms like a octopus
Shorty's strapped with the mac inside her pocket book
Blowing all lots of kush
Dark tints on the V so the D's can't spot the crooks
Just throw ya hands in the sky, don't try to stop the juks
Face down, lay on the ground, no sudden moves
Yo, then, take off his Timbs and get the work out his shoes
Rip off the pockets out his shoes, make sure he come out his used
I hear sirens, plus the cameras is watching, it's time to move
If you lolly-gagging, word to mama, I'll body bag 'im
Leave his frame riddled with holes, looking like Gotti had 'im
Bragging, juked, in the wagon, laughing
We slid a few blocks down, this kid was frozen
With stones so we decided to yapp 'im
I put the tool in his mouth, said ""You don't want the action
These ain't E pills, nigga, these is fuckin aspirin

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I'm skinned up, Nikes is scuffed, still bugging
Earlier, around four, how I escaped the bus
The way I fell, cracked the face of my watch, my man's chanting me on
Like run, son, don't go up in the spot
Jetting through bushes and backyards, neighbors is ratting me out
Dogs is barking all you hear is the cars
Sirens, I'm trying to think, and toss the iron
Bomb in my sweats, got me running funny, you think I'm lying
May God strike me, if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath
The weed got me paranoid, my heart's pounding through my chest
Trying to focus, yup, and make progress
That's what I get for slinging in them projects
Next thing you knew, I'm in this bitch's crib, chilling
Told 'em my story, you'll like this, I had her legs in the ceiling
Cooking me fried fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits
While she doing this, the bitch still sliding on lipstick
Now I got the fat stomach on, she cracking the Dutch
Playing with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck
Like come here, miss Lady Wop, where you put the condom box
You finished off the last one, oh shit, I hear the cops
Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed the white yorkie
Jetting up the steps, and pig want revenge like Porky's
So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door
Like 'ooh', I seen my man Meth going in raw
So he jumped up, balls out, hid in the closet
I'm dying laughing, he said ""Yo, Starks, be quiet""

[Method Man]
And let me put my drawers on, nigga, what dope you on, shit?
Should of knocked, before you came in the spot, Ghost, you wrong
Busting in here on that government shit, got the chick screaming
Grabbing the sheets, trying to cover her tits
She's asthmatic and you laughing, son, I bumped my toe all the nice things
Just run and try to grab the gun
Cuz shit's real, man, you spazzing dunn
There come a time in a man's life, he got to toss his pack and run
You know he family like Crack and Pun, but Mr. G.F.K.
State your business, after that, be one
Now can it be that you hot, lord, you did some shit on the block
That the cops trying to lock you for
Can't believe you blowing the spot, lord, my chick is bugging
You tripping, my dick keep slipping out my boxer drawers
Now I'm caught up in the drug sting, niggas is calling my horn
Police is hitting every corner we on
Can't understand that it's a thug thing, and in the middle of thought
I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon

[Raekwon]
I need my money, Meth, going on about them hundred birds
Tell Tone to get at me, on 'em and my clients want work
He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter fact, beep me
Word to mother, lord, sunny got me hurt
You still fucking shorty? I knew it, the big mouth broad
That be yoking my balls out, her little brother wanted two bricks
You know that nigga 'Lipps, he Maybach, on 26
All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick
Tell me foul shit, wild shit, ya'll niggas wear a lot a loud shit
Yo, that Steve Rifkin style, shit
Hit me with some other talk, him in New York
They love the Venezuela nigga, stabbed his son with a fork
That was Jesus roofs, his little niece
Little niece, his father's homework
That's the kid who gave us a boost
He gave them things on the arms, said for us to be calm

Yeah, I was fucking, but you don't get me back like that
Causing me grief, you know me and homey had beef
Now you got me losing my mind, out up in these streets
You'se flamingo, showing your true colors
Heard y'all was ducking down low when you see my brothers
But it's all good, I move from ex to next
Got the baddest little chick to sign off of them checks
Fat bubble, her body's like one of the best

She eye candy, smoother than Godiva chocolate

They tried him for his Louis', son wasn't having it though
Yeah, yeah my nigga, the color of glue
Decided on a intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga
This is like out of the blue
I'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain
Proceded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap
Think I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed
Fucked up my writing hand, that's my check
Now I wanna kill this lil' nigga true
Only thing that stop my gun flaming cause he related to you

Who? He ain't related to me
Just that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealing my gear

Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me
Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbing all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance
When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shoot himself in the groin
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holding his nuts, screaming ""God dammit
Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all looking at me for?
Call the police, do something
Motherfuckers standing around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red
I said chill that's fam duke
He put real work in that make you cute, fuck that

Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
they eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fucking real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six, buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Niggas got to die, if I go they got to go
Niggas got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggas got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid
If I go they got to go
Niggas got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggas got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid

[Raekwon]
We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Laying on the bed, looking like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, looking at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who would of ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the snitch
on these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doing sign language is twitching noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blasting yo
All I heard was Frank Lexi get the raw

Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holdin the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the morning, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawling, cause Tony for the stalling
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggas)
Working out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cutting that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissor hands them grams, (niggas) respect winners
I got them big spenders coming through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga
Uh-huh

Ghostface Killah,"Pss, yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!)
Oh shit, yo, yo, run!

Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G.
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to, Ghost here they come now!
Er! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge

I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's
Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is

[Chorus]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!

Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and

I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie

It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up

From the love we made

I ran up on the corner,
Popped a boner, like what
She pulled her shirt down, smiled, trying to hide her butt.
I said, 'Nah, baby girlfriend, you ain't got to do that'
I hope you ain't the anorexic type trying to lose that.
Us boys like 'em thick short weaves curls braids
I take'em buck 50 60 with them thick legs
We can sail it out 5 nights 6 days
Boats cruise wardrobe flights everything's paid
If I'm aggressive just pardon my gangsta
I just wanna get to know you
Get to show the way I move that's part of my gangsta
Like art yo I can sit you down and paint cha

Matter of fact she saved my life
When I'm outdoors she check and see if I'm alright
I'm OK babe, how you?
I'm alright, just that the baby's kicking I want some popeye chicken
And my back kinda hurts from the way I was sitting
hurry home so you can rub my big belly and kiss it
And I need some, don't be fresh girl
You know I can't help it baby but stay away girl
Yeah, that's my joy, love, strawberry shortcake

When I can't event walk straight
That's the reason why I got two court dates
Grown nigga like me let his thing blaze for that

Ghostface Killah,"This is a story of a player from the Island
That lost his way, such a price to pay
To, kiss those girls and make them cry
Kiss those girls and make them cry
To love, to lose, to plead for a do over
A do over, give me a do over, I want a do over
It's that Radio Raheem and Ghostface Killah

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

Aiyo, I used to get a threesome, every other weekend
Cheated on my girl til we nearly stopped speaking
She broke down and cried, and it hurts so bad
Her friends went and told her I was a brand new dad
Of course, she knows now, I ain't used no bag
My excuses, I couldn't cum like that
She warned me of days like this, if this should happen
She'll be out, and we'll be the ones, sharing the napkin
Silly dilly me, didn't follow the instructions
Don't bring nothing home, I don't wanna hear nothing
But brought to the world, innocent, two month old
Little girl, but what am I to do? Yo, I lost my boo
It's like being kicked out the group and lost my crew
Throwing the baby up to someone I hardly knew
Nah that shit don't add up, what am I to do, yo, I lost my jewel

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

Aiyo, I wrote this right here, on the bus to Riker's
Right next to the thieves, the cons, the lifers
For mad years, you held you down, I'mma overwhelmed in pain
And the worst time to leave you, now
I'm sorry, please forgive me, the streets caught me
I appreciate your concern and support for me
Most important, your honesty and trust, your heart's incredible
This the truth spilling out of my guts
If I, would of took the chance to see
What was place right in front of my face
For sure, nine out of ten times
My accent's wouldn't allow me to be so naive
And blind, to carry out these mistakes
I'm cheating, running around, blasting my gun
For me, my rep on the streets like touching a son
You like a fingerprint, I never find a match like you
Thanks for your patience, you find a man, I hope it's true

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

She was screaming out the window, I was walking up the block
Throwing out my Timbos, and all my clothes
She said, if my, apologies
She said, the lost won't fit those
And I said, baby, now let me explain
I know I had fucked up, it was a one time thing
So take all the time you need in this life
And if you let me do it over, I promise to do it right

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?",Do Over
Ghostface Killah,"Yeah, aiyo it's four in the morning, I decide to turn over
Pull down your little red drawers and start to kiss you all over
You hope it ('last, forever') I know baby, I hope it ('last, forever')
So I, took off my paisley pajamas I got from St. Thomas
Yo, I love you so much, so let me pay homage
And if you do, yo I promise never break a promise
So can I give you the honors my little Pocahontas?
Play by play, Miss Camay
You like a Zales Diamond in the window, right on display
You just a shining, precised in every curve you cut
And for your daddy, yo, you never have to tuck in your gut
Because I love it like that, stretch mark fat, plus let me show my crunches
To burn it off, just lay right on your back
And let me do my love dance, I pop it to the left
I pop it to the right, I get it all night, come on

Them other chicks must hail to the queen, as I
Put them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine
(Last, forever, last, forever)
We can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine
We got each other through the bad and the best of time
(Last, forever, last, forever)

Yo, yo, I'm lost in love, with nowhere to go
She says I'm a pain in the ass, boy, get to the store
She can say that, cuz we best friends, we play together
She carry my left rib, therefore we pray together
Bury me on top of her, in our graves together
Cuz when she feel pain, I know how to make it better
Talks, some long walks, communication in parks
Understand what she's going through, our listen was smarts
Especially when she's on her friend, I be hoping it leave
I have to bite my tongue, just to keep from arguing
Six days of that is like, who let the monster in
After it's finished then, I can get on top again
Shorty girl's my oxygen, never catch her gossiping
Look it ya'll, this my flower, she gon' keep on blossoming
Long as she is mine, and I am her, we gon' ride the wind
This lady here is all for me, I never have to lock her in

Them other chicks must hail to the queen, as I
Put them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine

We can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine
We got each other through the bad and the best of time

Yeah baby, let's do it

Oh shit, look at miss thing, you done grew into a stallion
Girl, and still don't got no ring?
Back then, you was a lot younger, now you older
Broke my heart, on what you had in the stroller
On the low, that could of been me, Huggie down
Fly and handsome, talk about little Starksky
With little Barkley's, little car seat
Two years later, here comes little Sharneese
I'm saying, are you involved, what's up with you?
And where homeboy at? Oh word, ya'll through?
Eff him, you know how I do, when I come through
Shut the whole block down like I got something to prove
But um, besides the lane, you look the same
Still blowing beauty marks, sitting under your bang
Ankle bracelets, that Donna Kay shit
I saw one rope for your throat, yo, it cost about 8 chips
Hoodrats, they be wearing that fake shit
Like her, she wear the same bag, like it ain't shit
Pardon me, excuse my French
Just read my lips, girl, everything's me

Don't worry, let's breeze the bar
And in case I ain't tell you, those jeans is hard
And those is the snitches, mean mugging, can't fight
Run into the police, fuck them niggas
I pull out, like a tooth, when the back is rotten
Finish 'em off, like your menstrual, after you spotting

Ghostface Killah,"In the crib on this rainy day, I'm chilling
Glass pianos and Portuguese drapes, hang from the ceiling
Persian rugs, Moroccan sofas
I walk to the house in paisley robes and Ferragamo loafers
And Iron Chef just season the salmon
It's coming down pouring, he watching BBC, eating a salad
I'm on the couch hitting the chalice
Checking my texts and out of nowhere, my dick is hard as a callus
I stood up, pulled back my sleeve, checked my watch
Where the, fuck is my wife, it's 12 o'clock on the dot
Very impatient, I'm getting nervous, can't stop pacing
My heart's racing, her Nextel don't get no service
Damn, all this over a gallon of milk
Something, happened to her, somebody wig'll get peeled
Okay, let me calm down, maybe she at Keeba house
Her birthday's today, we both bought her jeans and a blouse
Since 7 o'clock, she been gone for Owls
Jetted up the steps to the master suite, checked the shower
Nope, all that is there is towels and soap
Stomach is nauseous, caught a big lump in my throat
Found a phone book with mad names, looked down
Bow, there go Keeba, tying my shoes, I put the bitch on speaker
And bluntly addressed her, 'where's my girl?' (Yeah, she ain't out here)
(Last time I seen her, Ghost, she beat it on an old nigga)
Yo, Keeba stop playing, yo (Nah, we took a shot of Henn')
(Lately she work out by 10, I told her, bitch, buy a Benz)
(Or even shot a car, I'm getting me some Advil)
(Show these motherfuckers, how Keeba love to drive stick)
I snatched up my raincoat, the grass was soaked
Under the bed in the guest house, where I keep my toast
I yelled to the Chef, yo, watch for Kayla, check the pool and the bowling alley
If anything, just hit my cellular
Hopped in the go cart, the yard is dark, I'm bugging
Few feet from the guest house, is where I parked
Hope she's OK, is what I say in my heart
But something don't feel right, so is what I'm saying to God
As I got closer, something ain't kosher
I heard a bunch of squeaky sounds from the house, I don't think I'm suppose to
Is this the end, of the Starks regime?
Let me find out somebody on my ground, yo, is pounding my queen

Yo, I'mma kill, yo! (Hold on, cause)
(Baby, let me explain, you over reacting, that's not what it was)
Shut the fuck up, you got caught moaning with your legs up
Eyes all red, what? Did y'all just blaze up?
Then froze for a sec, so I dipped quick, lift the mattress
Aimed the biscuit at both of them bastards
What ya'll excuse now (Yo, cause, she said she live with her pop)
(Her dude mad strict, that's why we up in the spot)
(And yo, this little trick of yours, bought me a ten G watch)
He reached down for his drawers, that's when I let off a shot
Back the fuck up, snatched his covers
Had 'em looking like the black Adam and Eve, some sinful lovers
(Chill, Tone, put the gun down) How you know my name, son?
(Hold on, let me explain) Yo, y'all two is done
(Just let me put my drawers, get dressed, before I get rocked)
(Cause real talk, is looking like you trynna let off that glock)
Yeah, you right, you look familiar, you put my cable in, right?
The FiOS nigga, and you fucking my wife?
(Yeah, I put that cable in, nigga, we both got caught)
(And she a triflyn ass chick, don't act like it's all my fault)
(Baby, no) Mind your business

I could be your friend, I could be your tease
I can be a freak, I can be a P.Y.T.
If you ask, I'll be that
I could be your girl, I could be your wife
I complete your side, I could be watching me
If you ask, I'll be that
I'll be your homey, lover, friend, I'll be your everything
If you ask, I'll be that
Say you want me, I'll come running
I can be your baby, just you ask, I'll be that

Throw me on the bed, no clothes, wrestle me
After smashing that, then will you cook for me
Promise I won't hit you, you don't have to be shook of me
Washing my boxers, shirts folded nice and creased
Plus when we argue, she will never pull a beast
Clap for my baby, award winning, best nookie

You suck your teeth and keep it moving with the screw, yes

Blow your cake out, earrings is snowflaked out
Will you marry me? Will you carry me?
Through rain, hail, sleet and snow
Don't say no, you'll embarrass me

Yo, boo, let's cut the crap, you know we like each other
I been wanting you bad, yo, that's word to my mother
I know you got a man, and I'm involved

I've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke
I run and help you with your bags upstairs
I was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by eight
With no time to be at work at nine
She'll be back by six, son pissed you off, I know
When I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit
But still, you was looking mad cute to me
With your lips poked out, being rude to me
You're still sexy, luscious, and all them words
Only girl in the building with a full length fur
Had no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel
It's only your love I want the best of

All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

I had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat
Folding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet
So you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down
And got up, you start tonguing me down
Butterflies ran across my stomach
Didn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it
Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table
Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel
Your feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach
Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep
I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel
If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal
But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes
Somewhere inside, I know you feel the same
It's alright tho, you look like, you know how to get it
Here take my keys, come upstairs in a minute

All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

Let's stop faking, let's just go get naked
No more discussion, we can get to kiss and hugging
My premonition, told me I got what you're missing
So let's stop playing, baby girl, that's all I'm saying

All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know",Let's Stop Playin'
Ghostface Killah,"Don't be surprised, when you see me 'round town
Walking around, with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised, if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man, who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely

On this cold pavement, I feel like laying
In the middle of the street, and just saying
I can't take it, I won't make it
Too much weight on my shoulders, and my kids are getting older
For so long, I've been so strong
I've been crying all week since you've been gone
And as the tears roll out my eyes
Another happy young couples walks by

[Chorus]

Someone been sleeping in my bed, eating my food
Using my soap, laying up in my pool
Walking around in his boxers, like every thing's cool
Gassing my chick for the whip, dropping her off at school
Under my covers and changing my channels
Playing my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles
My cologne's half way gone, a fake don, my wiz fell for
Now she strolls the park under his arm
This is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming
From the outside bugging, with crazy knots in my stomach
Say what goes around, comes around, now I know it now
Now I'm the fool looking in while it's going down
If somebody would of told me, I might be lonely
Now it's on me, baby call me please

[Chorus]

Now he's getting all my kisses, stroking my loving
That 'posed to be me, but I was too stupid and stubborn
Like a piece of rope, I let it go, my mother said it so
You better straighten up, don't act like you didn't know
Her birthday came, heard she was hugged up, wearing his chain
Play in the sky box, at some bullshit Knick game
My son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done
And he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front
He take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time
We watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing
You better go beg or something, before she go love him
He's taking your spot, 'cause you was dissing mommy, you bugging
They don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason
She's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this

[Chorus]",Lonely
Ghostface Killah,"Whoa, oh, whoa
Shareefa, oh

From the blocking, to the dropping
I need a girl that's stacking and popping
When I come in late, she's not clocking
Not in the crib, throwing 'round pots and
Nice girl, that's clean, that was raised to cook
Be on the couch chilling, shorts on, reading a book
Biting on a pen, thin glasses on
French type frames by Yves Saint Laurent
Say hey pretty mama, do you fit the bill
Do you got what it take for you to fit in my wheel?
Would you bust that steel if, niggas came to kill me
Protect that safe, baby, dag, that's filthy
Whoa, somebody let her know up in here
He like Papa Smurf, I'm like Papa Bear
I'm just looking for a queen, so I can rock her ear
Tell her P. Tone in here, I got her locked this year

I'm not your average girl
I be your Bonnie right beside you
No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah
I'm not your average girl
See me without you is unlikely
Them other bitches they night like me, oh, wow

You can have keys to the boat, money follow me
I got the cheese and the yolk, plus the juice
That's fresh squeeze with the pulp, mama got a big butt
Tiffany chain, the stones freeze in the throat
Love to hold my hand, stepping off planes from D.R.
Luggage with a big black tan
Whatcha gonna do? You or him, me or you?
Fucking with him, you look mad pitiful
Boo, I'm not the type that be slobbing down hoochies
Looking at these hoes, eyes low like Droopy
Tugging on my jacket til the lights come on
We run trains on them bitches, never ice they arm
That's a no-no, chicken heads looking for a come up
In the club, 'oh my God', now they wanna run up
Nagging til the sun up, shut up, I'm not a double-up, boo
Go get your feet done, your toes, cuz they knuckles up

I'm not your average girl
I be your Bonnie right beside you
No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah
I'm not your average girl
See me without you is unlikely
Them other bitches they night like me, oh, wow

Baby, baby, don't waste your towel
Looking any further cuz the girl is ours
Holds it down for you, any place, any time
You already know, I'm the one, yeah, I'm that
Fly girl, rider, just say the word
Anything pop off, it's us against the world
Such a hood girl, with that dirty loving that'll make your toes curl

Yo, relax and chill, analyze the story
Love, your boy Tone got mass appeal
All them other little players ain't as half as real
They just wanna get up in you like Mass & Gill
But me, I need a wisdom, play it like wifey
Well mannered, understand the kid and not bite me
All my real ladies, put your hands up
Holla at your boy, if you ain't a groupie, right now, stand up

I'm not your average girl
I be your Bonnie right beside you
No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah
I'm not your average girl
See me without you is unlikely

Ghostface Killah,"Her face glow like I was exposed to sunlight
She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes, as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous, is all around, she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood, like we changed the channel
This is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on, parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes, as I gave her, her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me, are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything, I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
(Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary
It's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?)
Tone Starks (Peace, I'm Gabby, well I gotta go, my husband is waiting)
But before I go, can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen, I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you, on my team, you take care

Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight
It's OK

You can tell he must be on a mission
Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That your the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me
'Cause this is love, it gotta be love
Love at first sight

Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight
It's OK, any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by

Stagger Lee swine, could you stay mine, pretty please?
I""m begging you, girl, but time fly since 2 o'clock, boom

What am I to do? Your steeze got a live nigga wanting you
Around the way girl, that's why I don't mind sporting you

Someone who loves you, only half as much as I do
(He don't love you, he don't love like I love you, boo)
(He's not even close)

Aiyo, he don't really love you like I do
Kiss your feet, make love to you, like I do
Wake you up, in the night tank and surprise you
Cross my heart, swear, put my hand on the bible
I'm not a cold blooded killa, baby, I cry to
The best thing for me is when I'm laying beside you
Turn you over, open up, get up inside you
He a woman beater, no doubt, and he lies too

Stay, a little longer (please, baby, just one last time)
I know you have to go home to him (I know you got to bring it out, though)

When you leave I get aggy, I don't know how to act
The reality settle with a punch and a smack
When I know that you with him, you ain't calling me back
It be that thing down there, that got me way off track

Someone, who loves you (I'm telling you)
(His heart ain't even nowhere near it as mines be)
Only half as much as I do (come on, trust me on this)

If it's like that, fuck that nigga, he a clown
He don't know what he got, let that bastard suffer
I sent you roses, Donna Karen bags from Paris
He can't match my one, son, he'll be embarrassed

Stay, a little longer (all I wanna do is take you out tonight)

I know you have to go home to him (come on, let's go get our one-two on, come on)

Aiyo, baby, don't leave, cuz the club is popping
We got grandma yay, plus the tunes is knocking
On the dance floor, I'm sweating my ass off
Imagining us in deep lust, how you look with your pants off
My one-two step, your dress is so spun
And your neck smell good, look cute when you chewing your gum and
From the womb to the tomb, you're blessed with a killa walk
You don't have to give me none, it's tight, we'll talk

So dirty bag game but we give them the stacks
Pride game better add to fame

Ghostface Killah,"Yeah, niggas don't know about Fatback
With the different color records they had back in the days
You know what I mean, the belt-driven turntables
With Technics joints (with the slipmats!)
Put nickels on the needles so the motherfucking record won't jump
The needle won't skip and shit
Getting juice from the fucking light poles
Shout out to the Bronx, nigga!

Aye yo, this shit go way back like a Uni marker, kid
Bombing the D train and hit the Bronx up
Krylon bandits attack; Planet Rock, Bambaataa
Peace to Pylon discovering rap
And the DJ that made the first scratch
Paved the way for Flex, Mister Cee, 'nuff of them cats
See, this rap shit came at a time that was accurate
Twenty-something years later, I mastered it
Seen light poles get used for power
I was a little nigga
Couldn't stay out late I was sour
So I sat by the window, heard the DJ cut
Impeach the Pres, Apache, and just begun
Otis Redding, ""Tramp"" the music stopped
Guess the system blew out one of his amps
It'd take a little while, then it come back on
Somebody stepped on the wire and shit, that's all
Now everybody's back in the groove, echo chamber
""Check one two, one two"" that's my favorite
Strobe lights is live, Pink Champale
Little pink joints being lit up on the side
Couple niggas had two fives
Other than that, cleared a circle in the park and shoot 5
Girls wore they Lees and jellies
Jordache and Lees, (TF Lords fit the fellys?)
(Sams ?) and Kangol buckets, B.V.D's
Go to Sergio's like, fuck it
Seen the stamp on that Crazy Eddie
Niggas coming back from the Funhouse dusted
Throwing bubbles on the wall

[Chorus]
We must remind you
Where this rap come from
Yes my brother, my sister
It's our duty, we must remind you
Hip hop was set out in the park
We used to do it out in the dark

Yo, it all started at the After Midnight Philly, but walk with me
Mad niggas coming down from New York City
Prolly hit the skating rink USA
Banging Schoolly, ""Gangster Boogie"" and ""P.S.K.""
I remember shells, Gazelles, top tens, and lottos
Mega design, reefer smoke, Coqui nine bottles
(Entire wore velours, call the boys with the Lucci wore?)
84's from Atlantic City Gucci store
Linoleum break dancing, Rust-Oleum cans
I put the writing on the wall signed, ""Truly yours""
Philly smashed '87 Music Seminar
Out on the battlefield like Pat Benatar
Hit the borough with Krown Rulers out of Camden
People Patty Duke-ing in the party, all cramped in
Around the time Flav started cold lamping
""Rebel Without a Pause"" was the street anthem
Old Memorex cassette, tape collections
Bright spotlights on all the fights at the Spectrum
When the Fresh Fest come, leather bombers and sheepskins
Brothers would bust they guns to get one
MC Breeze, Disco C, Jazzy Jeff
Cash Money and Miz and Lady B
Everybody banging ""Sucker MC's"" in '83
I was South Philly like St. Charles and Crazy D
Them wild North Side Puerto Ricans would snuff you
Twenty deep in a Ford Escort, pumping the Tuff Crew
I used to follow my cousin, he was a buck too
""Y'all don't like how I'm living, well, fuck you!""
I been a G since a little kid
Sticking my head up into somebody's dollar party, getting into shit
And late nights, shoulda been in bed
Instead, I was running 'round with them downtown lemonheads
A little man, hanging where them grown women is
Under thirteen, seeing real strong images
And that's the reason for my real rap penmanship
That's where I started it, and that's where I'mma finish it

[Chorus]",In Tha Park
Ghostface Killah,"""Am I a good man? ...""

Take my hands out my pockets you can see my thumbs
Both of them turned green, from countin' the ones
Memorized by the glory, word life
Cut off niggas who killed Bill but couldn't do nothin' for me
Shout 'em out every once in the blue and kid too
I never rocked with, laws they keep away we cool
I devised my own stimulus, plan I'm niggarish
I'm tired of eatin those crumbs and black licorice
The frame of mind so ? like cleansin' the mic
Let the imam pray over my head and wash
Thoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly
Watch us gift men and fetch the green like barley
If that shit happen I'll feed his whole army
Talkin' 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali
Try to stay humble, and swallow my pride
In God I trust, now talk about the ones on your five
Crisp dollar billin', catch me in a little hut in Beneen
Village style, feedin' the children
Big pots of jasmine tea with Mandela
Africans chantin me on like Coachella
Ghostface bom ba ye, kumbiya my Lord
My death day, 24 karat tomb I lay
Wishin they could bury me, next to the prophets
Nabi, Lut, Is'haq, Musa, Harun, Muhammad
Ibrahim

""Am I a good man?"" (I don't know)
""Am I a fool?"" (We'll see)

The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds
High currents ? places we formin wings
Kings offering, thrones was there
Man with the 7 crowns on his dome was near
Feet walked over rose petals, song from the ghetto
Face froze in gold like the pharaoh
A dawn in glory, robe of light, a powerful cherub
As he passed the path, white doves cost the eyes of thugs
Eternal heartbeat, in the dark fire in his blood
700 books were opened
It breaks to right, they threw the crooks in the ocean
Scared, brass hair like it grew from goatskin
The chosen has spoken, tablets were broken
The smoke hand grabs an omen
Gravity grabbin' me gradually draggin' me through hell's cavity
This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals be
God felt bad for me but cast me into Caspain' Sea
Satan draggin' his key, Wu-Family's the faculty
K.P., K.P.

""Am I a good man? Am I a fool?
""Am I?""

He used to sling in the stairwell
Fast to put the rap on thinking cap, ignite your hair gel
No such thing as a fair sale
He'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail
And on this level a thug'll sell you garbage
No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge
Where the youths is kept comin' back with they life earnings
Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning
The outcome tragic, household dramatic
Living rooms to ?, basements to attics
Support from the B, hit the courts from a fiend
Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team
So they sent him gifts, body parts per diem
In a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em",Purified Thoughts
Ghostface Killah,"Yo, yo
Y'all respect my tour bus
We got whores with no drawers ready to do all four of us!

Boostin' niggas that pop tags in the mall
True spot hoggers, used a few stockings
Niggas hand over the cash when heat's to they noggin
I sing a lil' lullaby, who gon' testify
The way a gruesome murder been televised?
Stupid! My name still ring in the streets though
Eighty-six, used to slip crack through the peephole

Both arms in a sling, push me on stage

Chill I got next, go behind Dirt
Sometimes I had to chill instead get neck
Rich chandelier gown all over my flesh
'Bout to throw ladies to Haiti, peace to Wyclef
Blowed y'all cream never throw dollar bills up
You know we window baggin' that krillz up
Fingertips hurt puttin' that work in

Think God brought em into my life as a suggestion
We click, I like mink, she like iced out rings
The finer things in life, together we share drinks
Vodka and cranberry, my little cherry
If I got luck she will fill up my commissary
It was matching, I felt the bomb between us
She was the jelly to my peanuts, Mars to Venus
The earth to my sun, moon and stars we added up
Mathematically, it’s like I had a bad habit
Bitch you knew my lifestyle, check of a crime boss
She would hide my guns in the house then lie to the task force
Finish my sentence, do my exact frame of mind
Knew everything I had was hers and she was mine

And use everything in their power to shut us down

Got a new connect, Don Stone
Flew his private jet from Rome to talk business

I was a boss amongst white boys rocking the flow
I had hoes, bankrolls and minks by the dozen
My rise to power was quick, they just wasn't
Trying to make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan
I blacked out on them and started my own clan
Black Gambino, black suits, black Syndicate
My crime fam was tight, every move was intricate
The coke was brought in from by bad Colombian mules
Gorgeous women that I draped down in jewels
Streets fight started, mafia wars in Italy
Crime fam against fam and no one could do diddly

Do the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads
Go against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes
Follow no family rules, rules are for fools
Chase the paper cause it's the cash that rules

I'm moving keys, them DeLucas couldn't touch my pianos
Putting pressure on them Gambinis and Verrazanos
They love my money, they hate to see a nigga getting it
Selling drugs is taboo, but I ain't fucking sweating it
The dirt gotta get done so I took my position
One day I'm just Black Tone with a lot of ambition
Next I got status, dinners with all courses
Flights in and out of the country, they getting nauseous
Money, power, respect; rise of the black suits
Talk shit behind my back, but to my face salute
Hugs and handshakes, they can't stop my reign
Got the coconut, pilots bringing shit on their plane
It's a shame, they ain't have the balls to make moves
They pussies, couldn't walk a mile in my shoes

Do the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads
Go against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes
Follow no family rules, rules are for fools
Chase the paper cause it's the cash that rules

I'm a black vigilante killer, pro violence
It's the rebirth, born again
Rise through the vinyl spin
They took out Starks but the light shines within
It's the almighty rise of the murderous Ghostface
Bodies dropped in Owls, left a cold case
Colombian neckties from a black Gambino
Bodies get dumped in the black El Camino
It's Reno, gangster wars, money, power, respect
Revenge is felt like the heat from a tec
Tommy guns are irrelevant, I'm bulletproof now
I could fly through the air and duck your chick-a-pow
Black superhero, crime boss arch nemesis
Good vs. Evil since the first book of Genesis
Battle to the end that's the way of the thriller
And Starks is reborn as the Ghostface KILLAH

Murders, bodies chopped into ziplocks
Kill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks
Crime boss, I call warn the DeLucas
Watch my eyes turn red, I got a squad full of shooters
Murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
When the gas start to hum I put the spark to your grill

Late night, stuck in the limo
Hogtie the capo all up,
Beheaded the driver
Left the bitch in the back with no tongue as the survivor
Raw dog, spit in her mouth, disappear in a swarm of killer bees
Cripple 'em from they knees, take they legs out (Nigga you know the steez!)
I'm a nighthawk, eagle eye, power of mind control
Faster than the speed of light, you catch a big hole
Ruthless, six bodies hung in the meat room
The butcher shop, I call it the body shop
Start from the bottom, killin' all the way to the top
Carve my name in your skin, pull a stocking mask over your face for recognition
No time for remission, attack till there's no one left in the position
The return of the worst case scenario, uh
Ghostface attacks on land and now aerial

Shit is changed up for all types of reasons
Staten island ain’t the same, shit is lame
No familiar faces son, i’m dodging the game
I want a clean slate, but these cops stay screwin’
Snatching me up off the block, what am I doin’?
Oh, it’s officer dingle and his sidekick berry
Driving me around the hood so I could worry
See how fucked up it is there’s crackheads on every corner
Kids in the schoolyard smoking marijuana
I ain’t feeling it, this ain’t the way I left these blocks
And my name’s faded out like some old damn socks
I want respect, these streets was my playground once
I was the mack across 110th on these stunts
Not once would a nigga test me or gets zesty
I would walk down the street and sneeze, they all blessed me

Been on the battlefield for a long, long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine

Yeah, homie, i’m the kingpin called future
Make a killin’ in these buildings in the millions
Got ‘em feeling like brewster
Shit hot as fallujah
Kids grown now, they cock rugers
Welcome back to the sewers
Where new whips maneuver
No kids playing, no safe and sound havens
There’s tre pound cases on the playground pavement
No more dudes with 22’s in their sneaker soles
Kids tote shit that leave your body with a heap of holes
I’m that neighborhood blizzard flooding these streets with snow
Heavy iron on the ready, my shit’ll crease your clothes
Keep a flock of sweetest hoes, yeah, I sleeps with those
Little slum young keisha coles with cheaper clothes
Undercovers all around the gutter, they creepin’ low
I stays ahead, kid, I toss bread like pizza dough
I keep the tef around my torso with the piece below
That bulldog short nose, g be at peace with those, you know

Been on the battlefield for a long, long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine

Mama bear was a church woman, pop’s skated off
I was impaired, an introverted youngin’, a lot changed my course
From nowhere to my first onion then them cops came 
Across flashed the badge, took my stash, told my little ass get lost
Threw me off when my grind was prime time then
You could step on and stretch mine’s to a nine times ten
I was gone, remembering though that fine line’s thin
So I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men
Dealers ran the streets, but the d’s ran them
I was a killer underneath, but needed expansion
Something to constitute being high in a coupe
The cries from my youth so I applied for the suit
Salute to the enforcer, call me officer now
Supporter of paraphernalia, I toss it around
The link to the cartel, costs is down
It’s that denzel in training day shit, caution my grounds

And I vow for revenge

It's funny, only if niggas really knew
Got the keys to the city, I could kill a whole crew
Put the squeeze on the willy, get silly, go fool
Chop a nigga up, blame his body on his dude
What it do? It's bigger than the boys in blue
Beyond definition what this falls into
M's in my optic, no ends to my profit
Judges, prosecutors, politicians in my pocket
Hostage, high life, living on the edge
Toxic in hindsight, see me when I'm dead

What a web, catch a neck, then I'm onto to the next

And shit went left, had to pinch my flesh
And figure some other scheme to get cream, reign supreme

He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge
Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz
No friends, no foes, only evil to expose
Let's make a video
Tell Lu I got his grandson and daughter
And I ain't lookin for no ransom
I want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!
I want him to watch me strangle his daughter
Butcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!

He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee
He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight
Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!
But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!""
And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane
Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench 
of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!
Finally it was over
The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
They shifted through the dead remains
The bedrooms, and the entry way
WHERE THE HELL IS LESTER KANE?!

Now what is this that stands before me?
Underneath this wack off coughing
It's Logan and her half beat offspring
I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing

Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days
They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route
The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house
Where to find Logan and her afraid child
In a dark corner where they were being held
They were blindfolded with taped mouths
No light or water, arms and legs bound

Break my back all week for

And amp up Ramones
And volume maximum

And the Chinatown whispers that would 
Obviously be muttered by the dogs 

Now compassion I don't lack 
Just heart filled with runner beans 
And feet like in running shoes 
And yes it was just you and me 
Just fly

No turning round
Set course for the rocks mate, chin up

And flights old, are melting with the past 

So it won't be forever then 
I can't do forever friends 
Cause something in my character just takes a hold 
And throws me out the car 

Maybe if I looked afar 
I could stop the catastrophe 
But you and me weren't meant to be 
And someone somewhere knew it from the start 

Now it's love that soaks my heart 
I contemplate the dark 
And superglue the memories and better days 
The times that made you laugh

Our passions overshadow the sky of fire.

In search of our reward.
Pushing forward in our ascent,
Evade the conflicts that lye ahead,
Our sprits will inspire those who never believed.

Follow the map we share upon our sleeves.
We share, we share.
Ambition leads us to, a higher plain where honors are received.

The choices we make, will be engaging.
Together we will prosper and flourish as one.

Climbing stairways, drown the sky.
Embrace the future, with hearts and minds.

Ghoti Hook,"Beauty sat bathing by a spring where fairest shades did hide her
The winds blew calm the birds did sing the cool streams ran beside her
My wanton thoughts enticed mine eye to see what was forbidden
But better memory said ""fie"" so vain desire was chidden

hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonny
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonnie
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonny
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonnie

into a slumber then I fell when fond imagination
Seemed to see but could not tell her feature or her fashion
But even as babes in dreams do smile and sometimes fall a weeping
So I awaked as wise this while as when I fell a-sleeping

hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonny
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonnie
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonny
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonnie

say man are you down for doing something positive in the community?
No not really
Well ain't you worried about doing the right thing?
Well I don't care

Her back of blue shoes
She wore green, they wear it anyway
She and the car
Went back through the red light
Stop I forgot all my memories
I see red when I see you
Bells ring at 3 Am
I get mad, drinks get spilled
Five past two I don't feel sad
But then I see you and I see red

I can't look down
Or I might follow you
I might follow in your footsteps
I see your shoulder the sun down
What's the luck
And I had to hunt, I had to hunt you

I see red when I see you
Bells ring at 3 Am
I get mad, drinks get spilled
Five past two I don't feel sad
But then I see you and I see red

don't feel sad

Don't feel sad

Here it comes creeping so close to the bed
Goodbye to darkness I see your shining face

Five past two I don't feel sad

And still I cannot sleep
Hidden lines have come to a head
No more secrets left to keep
And now that everthing is gone
The morning sun seems bittersweet
Has the day begun already?

And now ashamed of who I am
I missed what everyone could see
Always a fight for me to change
Into the man you want me to be
A better man that shares my name
Can I look into his eyes
And see a reflection of

I try to make it through the day
Too confused to disbelieve
Did it use to be this way?
I try to remember speaking
You I thought would understand
Appreciate my weakness
And tell me I can be a man

And now ashamed of who I am
I missed what everyone could see
Always a fight for me to change
Into the man you want me to be
A better man that shares my name
Can I look into his eyes
And see a reflection of

What's left inside to see these captured thoughts surrounding jealousy
No hope do you believe if left alone these worlds will bury me
And who will sing this boy to sleep in the stillness of his room
Present a melody of peace beckon dreams to follow soon
But if there's no one left but him ,then the curtain has been drawn
A wasted life deserves no song

And now ashamed of who I am
I missed what everyone could see
Always a fight for me to change
Into the man you want me to be
A better man that shares my name
Can I look into his eyes
And see a reflection of me

Don't leave behind an only son
To wish that you were gone

As a boy I held your hand
I never wanted you to leave
I could not ever understand
And now I'm here in disbelief
Do you have to say goodbye?

I've lived my life, knowing now
Imagining you here
Knowing what would take your life
Recounting all my tears
Did you see them then?
Did you think of how
You would tell someone
""I have to leave now""?

On cold wings she's coming

You better believe it.

When she embraces
Your heart turns to stone
She comes at night when you are all alone
And when she whispers
Your blood shall run cold
You better hide before she finds you

Whenever she is raging
She takes all life away

Whenever she is raging

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year

And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Y me sabe mal saber que sigues estando
En cuatroparedes que me ven durmiendo y que me ven soñando

Y en una promesa se perdio tu libertad
Y en el horizonte vi llover tu soledad
Y en cada recuerdo que me derrite
que hace que escoja entre perderte o escapar

Se caso el invierno con tus labios
Puse la vida en orden y vendi el viejo sillón
Se perdio en tus ojos el milagro
Y aproveche para cambiar de piel y religión

Y me sabe mal saber tu significado
Porque me confunde cuando busco amores en el diccionario
Y me sabe mal tener tu saliva blanca
Esa que te brota cuando estas nerviosa cuando te delatas

Y en una promesa se perdio tu libertad
Y en el horizonte vi llover tu soledad
Y en cada recuerdo que me derrite
que hace que escoja entre perderte o escapar

Y en una promesa se perdio tu libertad
Y en el horizonte vi llover tu soledad
Y en cada recuerdo que me derrite
que hace que escoja entre perderte o escapar

Gian Marco,"Tu tristeza se juntó con mi alegría
Y le robamos al alma tres suspiros
Decidimos empeñar nuestra rutina
Y aplicar lo que aprendimos
En mi ausencia y en tu exilio, y atardecer dentro de ti

Mi locura y tu serenidad se entienden
Y un extracto de tu boca me domina
No tenemos ni una deuda no hay pendientes,
No hace falta nada a cambio
No hay espacio a la ironía, respírame soy para ti

Dame una gota de lluvia, dame una promesa
Dame un buen comienzo para ser mejor
Dame tu sueño a diario y una noche en vela
Para ser el duende que cuida tu amor
Dame un fin de semana que viene de vuelta
Dame una aventura en nuestra habitación
Dame una pluma vieja y una servilleta
Siéntate a mi lado y duérmete en mi inspiración

Sé que tú yo tenemos una segunda parte,
Que tu cuerpo y mi delirio son amigos
Sé que somos tan distintos, tan iguales
La cuestión no es el cariño
Sólo basta con mirarte, y anochecer pegado a ti

Dame una gota de lluvia, dame una promesa
Dame un buen comienzo para ser mejor

Gian Marco,"Sácame de esta duda mi amor
Si sigo así me voy a arrebatar
Avísame de una vez por favor
Si tus ojitos me quieren mirar
Sácame de esta duda embustera
Que me maneja a su antojo y manera
Cuéntame de una ves por las dudas
Si mi esperanza está buena y tiene cura
Sabe dios si tienes ganas de llamarme
Sabe dios si en el horóscopo del día dice
Que vas a volver

Lejos de ti no se vive feliz, lejos de ti
No me queda el amor
Lejos de ti se me agranda esta pena, lejos
De ti no se acaba la guerra
Lejos de ti se me esconde la luna, y los
Inviernos son una locura
Lejos de ti, lejos de ti

Dicen que las canciones de amor
Siempre repiten y dicen lo mismo
Dicen que no te han visto pasar
Y que te fuiste sin pedir permiso
Dicen que si amas algo y se aleja
Si de verdad es tuyo regresa
Dicen que está prohibido extrañarte
Que no debo hacerte caso y olvidarte

Sabe dios que las palabras son del viento
Sabe dios si tu alegría y mi quebranto
Tengan ganas de volver a verme contigo

Cada mañana es un refugio
Y cada paso en la distancia
Me hace marcas en la piel
En cada linea de mi mano
Te he guardado un pensamiento
Eres el ángel de mi cuento
Eres mis ganas, eres mis ganas
Eres mis ganas de vivir",Lejos de Ti
Gian Marco,"Vivir en mil pedazos
Crecer con actitud
No creo en los fracasos, no
No creo en cosa malas, si estas tu

Tratar de ser constante
Comprar mi libertad sacrificar el miedo
Vivir sobreviviendo si no estas
Resucitar si vienes o te vas

Adivinar que sueñas mientras duermes
Seguirte si sales a caminar alimentar mi suerte
Besandote en la boca una vez mas
Resucitar si vienes o te vas

Vivir en un refugio
Secar tu cicatriz
Con balas de mis ojos
Matar a los fantasmas que hay en ti

Tomarle tiempo al tiempo
Vetar mi soledad hacerme compañia
Vivir sobreviviendo si no estas
Resucitar si vienes o te vas

Adivinar tus cartas en el juego
Seguirte sin poder ver mas alla
Alimentar mi suerte
Besandote en la boca una vez mas

Resucitar si vienes
O te vas

Gian Marco,"No me gusta estar lejos de tu alma
Why sentir que el viento no es de aqui
Saber que a mi otoño le hacen falta
Unas hojas que cayeron why se quedaron en ti

No me gusta hablarte en el silencio
Why en el calendario descubrir
Que lunes a viernes yo te pienso
Why los fines de semana vuelvo a reposar el alma
Vuelvo a reinventarte en mi

Si esconderte sólo es parte de tu juego
Why si al final de tu camino estoy ahi
Si con toda esta paciencia yo te espero
Si me vuelvo a enamorar
No hay derecho a reclamar de nuevo

Te puedo sembrar en mi memoria
Para cosechar una intuición
Puedo hacerte parte de mi historia
Deshojar cada detalle why ponerte cien finales
Mientras pienso qué pasó

Si esconderte te protege de mi sombra
Si avisar que no regresas es mejor
Si de la misma frontera no me muevo
Si me vuelvo a enamorar
No hay derecho a reclamar
",Si Me Vuelvo a Enamorar
Gian Marco,"Hoy mis ideas te quieren cantar
Why coronarme con tus ojos de papel
Voy a ponerle a tus encantos adornos de navidad
Hoy mi locura te quiere raptar
Sin resistencia why sin ponerte condición
Multiplicar las buenas cosas, dividir mi corazón

Que ahora está aquí, dispuesto a repartirse en cada beso
Le he pedido a Dios permiso para hablarle a tus deseos
Rescatar de tu mirada angelitos de la guarda why entender
Que me he enamorado sin querer

De tu mundo why de tu luz de tu manera de hablar
De tu boca why tus lunares tu forma de caminar
De tu piel why de tu flor de tu forma de suspirar
De esa risa contagiosa de tu alma

Hoy tengo ganas de pertenecerte
Ser esa parte que le falta a tu mitad
Voy a librarte de lo malo why también de la oscuridad
Hoy mi inocencia quiere renacer
Why sin prejuicio confesarte mi intención

Como te quiero why como curo tu dolor

Te voy a demostrar
Que con mi sol why con tus nubes puedo hacer llover
Que con un poco de cariño lo vas a entender
Que la humedad en la sequia
Es como amor que no se olvida, porque

Soy la lluvia que cae sobre el mar, que se evapora en tu mirar
Soy agua fresca why es por ti que caigo desde el cielo
Soy la lluvia que no tiene fin, que se evapora en tu jardin

Giancarlo Campomanes,"Yo estaba tranquilo me dijo te amo
Mi amor de hace un tiempo tenemos que hablar
Yo dije que pasa

Que no tengas miedo que no es nada malo, vas a ser papá
Me quedé algo frío
Me dijo que pasa acaso no lo quieres
Yo dije: que va
Me quedé pensando que nombre ponerle si salía varón o como la mamá

Se nos agranda el corazón
Enfrentando a la marea
Enfrentando a la ciudad y la vida que te golpea
Si bien no hay nada que ofrecer
No te preocupes corazón
Donde antes comían dos
Ahora comemos tres.

Como pasa el tiempo como va creciendo fácil sale guapo como el papá
Ella me dice tranquilo
Con que salga sano
si se parece a ti
Lo puedo superar
Y ambos sabemos llegará aquel día en que se haga grande y se tenga que ir
En ese momento recuerdo a mis padres
Todo lo que hacen por mi

No quiero volver a ser
Esclavo de tu triste amor
El amor que aquí estaba
Por fin se marchó

Las canciones desperdiciadas
Los besos bajo la almohada
Las desveladas noches
No aguantaron ni un reproche

No quiero volver a ser

como empezó
nuestra historia de dos

Jugando y jugando
me tomaste de la mano
y sentí algo profundo
en ese corazón tuyo

queda
nada entre los dos
solo quieres
sentir rencor

Poco tiempo después
te volví a encontrar
de la mano de alguien más
engañándole a la gente

Creyendo tú
esconder el sentimiento
que habita aquí dentro
para así

Fingir a tiempo libre
sentirme invisible
para ver...

Que ya no queda nada
que puedo yo hacer
por ti...

te digo una vez más
que ya no me hace falta

e irnos hacia un lugar dónde nadie nos dañe más

No entiendo porque siempre alejamos al amor
y lo reemplazamos por una corta ilusión
pero contigo nada de esto ya pasó

dónde estarás

que nos dimos tomados de las manos

Me había enamorado de tu sonrisa
Y estudié cada gesto en ti

Y ahora que lo pienso
fuiste tú
Mi dulce alimento, tú
No hay nadie como tú
Quiero decir que nada como tú

Y ahora entiendo que tuve miedo
y no pude cuidar este amor

¿Para qué te hare falta?, me gustas más así
Con aquel vestido que me enloquece
Why no te vengas conmigo si no me vuelvo de golpe

Como lo hare un chiquillo, con ese miedo que
Tú puedes ver en mi cara, enamorado de ti
Porque eres bella, ¡Dios! Más que bella
Pasas de bella, ya no se puede más

Una chica sin inhibiciones
Sin atarse a condiciones, de mirada lúcida
Tan bella que se pierde tras las gafas
Grandes, gordas, como dos farolas
¡Qué mirada plácida!, ¡qué bella!

Porque una chica, una chica, una chica normal
Tan sincera, tan bella, inocente, serena, me va más a mí
Porque eres bella, ¡tan bella!, que eres casi mortal
Una chica, ¡qué chica!, me gustas así

Mira cómo caminas, siente cómo respiras
Eres toda una estrella why tú no sabes que
Que la protagonista está dentro de ti

Yo que no sé lo que digo, yo que no sé lo que hago
Yo que sería hasta ""El malo"", con tal de hacer un papel
De estar en este film yo nunca me cansaré
Porque eres bella, ¡Dios! Más que bella
Pasas de bella, ya no se puede más

Sin atarse a condiciones, de mirada lúcida

Chi si volta è perso e resta qua
Io so per certo amico
Mi son voltato anch'io

E per raggiungerti ho dovuto correre
Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che
See'è un mondo che va avanti anche se
Se tu non ci sei più
Se tu non ci sei più

E dimmi perché, in questo girotondo d' anime
Non see'è un posto, per scrollarsi via di dosso
Quello che ci è stato detto
E quello che ormai si sa, e allora sai che see'è

see'è che see'è, see'è che prendo un treno
Che va a paradiso città
E vi saluto a tutti e salto su
Prendo il treno e non ci penso più

Un viaggio ha senso solo senza ritorno
Se non in volo, senza fermate nè confini
Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani
Io mi prenderò il mio posto

Recuerda que también a ti te he perdonado
Y en cambio tú dices ""lo siento, no te quiero""

¿Qué vas a hacer? busca una excusa y luego márchate
Porque de mí no debieras preocuparte
No debes provocarme

Ti sfiora appena e poi se ne va
Ti dice scusa, ciao, passavo di qua
Come una donna che non ci sta
Eppure a me non mi va,
Non va, sai di starmene qua
Qua sospeso a meta
No non mi vai bene
E goder non conviene
E mi tieni in catene
No non mi va se cade un pelo
Crolla il cielo 
Non mi va, non mi va

La notte poi vado in giro
Come se fossi un vampiro
Che sono in cerca damore
Per colpa io del tuo onore
E le signore piu belle 
Mi danno le caramelle 
E tu che mi dici aspetta
Che vado troppo di fretta

Tu sei sempre stata mia
Che amarsi no non è mai una sfida
Ma è come cercare in noi una guida

Gianmaria Testa,"Il primo fu Capo di Buona Speranza
Chiuso per legge e decreto speciale
Che la smettessero le onde pacifiche
D'imbastardire quell'altro mare

Poi fu la volta di Panama e Suez
E quindi del Bosforo e di Gibilterra
Ogni maroso pretese il rispetto
Della sovrana indipendenza

Niente più scambi di acque e di pesci
Niente più giri del mondo in veliero
Tutti i canali rimasero chiusi
A qualunque passaggio di flutto straniero

Così per un poco tornarono chete
Le acque dei mari di tutto il pianeta
Ma non durò molto che un'onda riprese
A dir ch'era tempo di farla finita

Successe che un giorno nel mare nostrano
Lo Jonio pretese di stare da solo
E così vollero pure il Tirreno
Il mar di Sardegna e l'Adriatico al volo

Insomma nessuno si mischi a nessuno
Tuonavan le acque dei bassi fondali
Ognuna rimanga ancorata ai suoi porti
E bagni soltanto le sabbie natali

Sembrava finita ma era solo l' inizio
E anche così fu ben brutto vedere
In quel che era stata la grande distesa
Lo strazio dei fossi a dividere il mare

Era solo l'inizio, come già si diceva
Perché? Ora la febbre secessionista
Andava ammalando ogni singola riva
E niente e nessuno riusciva a dir basta

Così da Trieste alla punta pugliese
E dalla Sicilia alla Costa del Sole
Ogni più piccola cala pretese
L'indipendenza e non solo a parole

Ma la questione divenne barbina
Quando si presero goccia con goccia
E ognuna guardando la propria vicina
Diceva vai via o ti rompo la faccia

Il mare fu presto una grande rugiada
Inutile ai pesci e a qualunque creatura
Morirono il tonno, l'acciuga, lo spada
Restarono in secca le barche d'altura

E poi un giorno, o una notte, non so
Accadde qualcosa di ancora più strano
Conoscete la formula H2O
Sì quella dell'acqua, che tutti sappiamo

Ebbene l'idrogeno trovo da ridire
Sostenne di avere la maggioranza
E quindi il diritto sovrano di ambire
All'ormai sacrosanta indipendenza

Ci fu come un vento, un soffio infinito
E l'acqua dei mari s'invaporo in cielo
Rimase un deserto di sale e granito
Ma buio e profondo più nero del nero",20 Mila Leghe (In Fondo Al Mare)

Passerà questa pioggia sottile come passa il dolore

E il tempo è ora

Lascia che sia facile

Soffia sulla cenere

Sei musica 
Ovunque andrai
E il buio che sembra eterno
Non ci spaventerà

Dimentica
Mani che si arrendono
Dimentica
C'è l'alba tra le nuvole

È un'ombra sai

E abbiamo fatto ogni salita senza chiedere perchè
Dimentica",Dimentica

Forse il tuo malessere è il mio.

Non mi lasciare più,non mi lasciare più,
Mi abbandono alle tue parole,
Sopra il filo da cuore a cuore e
Non mi lasciare più, non mi lasciare più,
Quando entro nella tua mano mi sei dentro
E così lontano andiamo andiamo nell'aria,
Nel fango rimango affianco a te nel cielo,
Sul fondo vado avanti io per te

Non mi lasciare più, non mi lasciare più.
Guardo intorno a me fino agli occhi tuoi
Pensarti è come essere con te tra vertigini e
Dispiaceri per raggiungerti cado giù.

Non mi lasciare più cammino,

Gianna Nannini,"Questa di Marinella la storia vera
Che scivolò nel fiume a primavera
Ma il vento che la vide cos bella
Da il fiume la port sopra una stella.

Sola senza il ricordo di un dolore,
Vivevi senza il sogno di un amore
Ma un re senza corona e senza scorta
Buss tre volte un giorno alla tua porta.

Bianco come la luna il suo cappello
Come l'amore rosso il suo mantello.
Tu lo seguisti senza una ragione
Come un ragazzo segue l'aquilone

E c'era il sole e avevi gli occhi belli
Lui ti baci le labbra ed I capelli
C'era la luna e avevi gli occhi stanchi
Lui pose le sue mani sui tuoi fianchi

Furono baci e furono sorrisi
Poi furono soltanto I fiordalisi
Che videro con gli occhi delle stelle
Fremere al vento e ai baci la tua pelle

Dicono poi che mentre ritornavi
Nel fiume chissà come scivolavi,
E lui che non ti volle creder morta
Buss cent'anni ancora alla tua porta

Questa la tua canzone, Marinella,
Che sei volata in cielo su una stella
E come tutte le più belle cose
Vivesti solo un giorno come le rose
E come tutte le più belle cose
Vivesti solo un giorno come le rose",La Canzone di Marinella
Gianna Nannini,"Qui dove il mare luccica e tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto.
Te voglio bene assale
Ma tanto, tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai.
Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e
La bianca scia di un’elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica, si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza,
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all’improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare.

Te voglio bene assale
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai.
Potenza della lirica dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po’ di trucco e
Con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano, così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole, confondono I pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo, anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come la scia di un’elica
Ma sì, è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto.
Te voglio bene assaje ma tanto tanto bene sai

La gente della mia età andare via
Lungo le strade che non portano mai a niente,
Cercare il sogno che conduce alla pazzia
Nella ricerca di qualcosa che non trovano
Nel mondo che hanno già, dentro alle notti che dal vino son bagnate,
Dentro alle stanze da pastiglie trasformate,
Lungo alle nuvole di fumo del mondo fatto di città,
Essere contro ad ingoiare la nostra stanca civiltà
E un dio che è morto,
Ai bordi delle strade dio è morto,
Nelle auto prese a rate dio è morto,
Nei miti dell' estate dio è morto...
 
Mi han detto
Che questa mia generazione ormai non crede
In ciò che spesso han mascherato con la fede,
Nei miti eterni della patria o dell' eroe
Perché è venuto ormai il momento di negare
Tutto ciò che è falsità, le fedi fatte di abitudine e paura,
Una politica che è solo far carriera,
Il perbenismo interessato, la dignità fatta di vuoto,
L' ipocrisia di chi sta sempre con la ragione e mai col torto
E un dio che è morto,
Nei campi di sterminio dio è morto,
Coi miti della razza dio è morto
Con gli odi di partito dio è morto...
 
Ma penso
Che questa mia generazione è preparata
A un mondo nuovo e a una speranza appena nata,
Ad un futuro che ha già in mano,
A una rivolta senza armi,
Perché noi tutti ormai sappiamo
Che se dio muore è per tre giorni e poi risorge,
In ciò che noi crediamo dio è risorto,
In ciò che noi vogliamo dio è risorto,
Nel mondo che faremo dio è risorto",Dio è Morto

Sento, e la voce ti manca
La ninna nanna d'allor
Oggi la testa tua bianca
Io voglio stringere al cuor
 
Mamma, solo per te la mia canzone vola,
Mamma, sarai con me, tu non sarai più sola!
Quanto ti voglio bene!
Queste parole d'amore che ti sospira il mio cuore
Forse non s'usano più
 
Mamma
Ma la canzone mia più bella sei tu!
Sei tu la vita
E per la vita non ti lascio mai più!

Gianna Nannini,"Penso che sogno così 
Non ritorni mai più, 
Mi dipingevo la faccia
E le mani di blu, 
Poi d'improvviso venivo 
Dal vento rapito, 
E incominciavo a volare 
Nel cielo infinito. 

Volare ohoh
Cantare oh oh oh oh,
Nel blu dipinto di blu, 
Felice di stare lassù, 
E volavo volavo 
Felice più in alto del sole 
Ed ancora più sù, 
Mentre il mondo 
Pian piano spariva lontano laggiù, 
Una musica dolce suonava 
Soltanto per me. 

Volare oh oh 
Cantare oh oh ohoh
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
Felice di stare quaggiù. 

E continuo a volare felice
Più in alto del sole ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare
Piccino laggiù.
La tua voce è una musica dolce
Che suona per me.

Cantare oh oh ohoh
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu

Gianna Nannini,"Sei una meraviglia e io lo so 
Ma hai rinunciato a vederlo 
Sei forte del tuo silenzio 
Che distrarresti anche Dio 
Col sorriso il candore 
Di chi ama davvero come te
Ma se camminerai vicino a me
Io pioverò e ti bagnerai
Di verità e di pazzia
E senza neanche un preavviso
Ci sarò io ci sarai tu
Come qualche anno fa

Se c'è una luce stanotte non è il chiaro di luna
Sei tu che fai luce e che sei bellissima come sei

Tu che cerchi sempre il paradiso
Andando troppo lontano
E che ti neghi alla vita facendo no con la mano
E sai donare e mi proteggi
Nell'anima hai tutto un mondo ma non lo esplori mai
Vai
Bacia le sue labbra e non pentirti
Perché sei troppo speciale
Lo dico io lo dico e basta
Lo dice tutta la gente
Ma se vuoi io ti proteggerò da te stessa

Se c'è una luce stanotte non è il chiaro di luna
Sei tu che fai luce e che sei bellissima come sei

Amica mia dietro la porta c'è un mare
Andiamo al largo io e te come qualche anno fa
Amica mia cosa non farei per salvarti
Per farti ridere ancora
Tu che non mi hai lasciata sola mai
Tu sei per me
Ore ed ore a pensare a non capire perché
Quando ci incontriamo noi
È tutto come qualche anno fa",Amica Mia

Gianni Basso,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Gianni Basso,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks

Che ahimè non ho
Di sdraiarmi e mettere su un bel film
Di quel genio di Totò

Senti che ancora fischietto la mia Yesterday
Se non fosse del tutto perverso e ridicolo
Giuro che piangerei

Vedi come divento patetico
Ora che penso che sono dove tu non sei
Così vanno le cose

E che ormai è impossibile la normalità
Io saluto la statua della libertà
Mi tengo la mia schiavitù

Oh but still you're blind, while you're dreaming your life away

Hey little boy, are you lonely at all?
There's a million girls want you to call
They can cover all your wildest fantasies, oh with ease
But there's just one thing, it's gonna cost you, yeah you

Hey big sucker, can I talk to you?
This is no big pitch, every warp is true
I can sell you everything you need, make you bleed

Giant,"I've been looking for an answer in the sky
Can you hear me? Cause I need a reason why

Don't let the sun go down, 'cause tomorrow she'll be gone

Give me one more day and I'll make her stay, hold back the night
If you're really there and you hear my prayer, hold back the night

Hold back the night, oh the night

Every minute, it gets closer to goodbye
Can't you give me just a few more hours to change her mind
Don't let tomorrow in, 'cause I just can't face it alone

I watch the light fading to black
I'm counting on you to build me a bridge, so I can bring her back

Soul to soul, no control, breathin' in your heart beat

You're on the way to stone, and now as I lie here with you

Out of the dark and into the light, mission of these shames
I don't want to wait another lifetime, 'til this one happens again
What you've done is takin' me from the prison that I live in

A taste on my lips, a whispering word in your ear
Oh passion, we're children just playing with passion
Losing our grip, falling asleep at the wheel
Still we hold on to the bitter end, thinking we can never lose
Baby it's a cold night and the winds of change are blowing

And these are the innocent days
Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands
And these are the innocent days, I know we're the last of the runaways

Never return, till love takes us home
Lover, we're drowning our doubts in each other
Closing our eyes, we bury the truth in the sand
I cannot take it, 'cause when we don't feel it, we fake it
Oh someday these nights come back to haunt us again
Oh we lie here at the water's edge, wishing we could float away
'Cause it's too late to turn back, when the only bridge is burning

And these are the innocent days
Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands
And these are the innocent days, I know we're the last of the runaways

I walk alone, while you are waiting, but somehow you saw through me

It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender, when love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two

I've been blinded by this fear inside that love is just a game
You distract yourself with someone else, and both havin' travelled in pain

He'll be waiting up for you""

Where would I be without you, lost and alone 'til your love pulled me through
If not for a heart so true, where would I be, I'd be without you
These four walls surround me, it's a price that I must pay
There's fear all around me now, but I'm a million miles away
Locked inside an endless night, you're just a dream away
No I won't give up on the fight, I'll be back with you some day

And I believe I can make it, when I see the hope in your eyes
And I know that you won't let me down, where would I be without you

One day you're here, the next you're gone, there's so much I need to say
But I know that I'll carry on, 'cause you were with me all the way

If they pass the bar

Were marjonal as well
They've added up and deducted their losses
Earned the rights to kill and tell

Look at you now Mother Martha and Sonya-the-trip
Guard their histories well
They're trading up from Halstons to
Harleys, Chanel to a burning leather smell

Listen up if you can hear me
There ain't no point to dwell
If I still stand where the earth
Tried to swallow, I hope you wait for me to live to tell

Severe nostalgia and upset to remember

Too many ends to meet
He felt like an empty gun
He felt the claw of the law

""Son, what is it you're up to?""

Looking like an accident waiting to happen
Politics, money or dope
Empty pockets, emptier hope
You could've been all tucked in tonight
Ted Koppel could've been your night
Light Instead we're both out here

Looking like accidents waiting to happen
Good cop yang and bad cop yin
Strap on cuffs and take him on in
Yin says, ""This is just like shotgun fishing
We ought to come back to this hole again""
Bitten lip bantor, loose leaf panthers

Way too wordy an episode
Likes to ride standing up on a bumpier road

Giant Sand,"The car stopped running in the middle of the road
Beyond any phone line or 911 code
Hopes were dismal we'd ever get towed
And if we slept in that ride we might awake upon explode

It was as dark as night when the sun went down
Long after we left the last little town
Not even the endless heat of day cared to stick around
It got as cold as it gets here then got colder we found

The linkage must've jammed 'cause now the Chevy won't budge
The kid sleeps on your lap and won't wake when you nudge
You left a whole world of light behind, now you hold a grudge
And as you carry the kid out, you curse the clutch

It'll be a wonder if you both can avoid the death of cold
This stuff used to be cake but now takes its toll
How can you be this unlucky just to get this unlucky old?
And you wonder what else lives in this slice of road

And you lie to your hands, you lie to your heart
You lie to your liver and tell them they will survive
Ironically, as you lie there by the side of the road
And can't wait for the sun to come and burn off the cold

When you awake it's still dark
And the thunder could mean rain
You check the child's breathing
And curse the clutch again

It seems impossible that no one has passed
Or crashed into your ride
And as the lull of sleep again attacks
The rain finds where you hide

Somewhere there's a bar filled with the careless and content
Somewhere folks are happy and don't care which way you went
Somewhere it's even warmer than the day you just spent
And wish them away with deplore and lament

There's songs that come to mind
When the mud turns blood to ice
A dance that shows itself
When the night becomes so spiced
A realm you never felt that steals away the life
Out of your heart, out of your soul, it takes a slice

With the dull grey thud of morning
You can't believe you're not dead
The child wakes with a smile
And just wants to be fed

There were no ghosts of the past
Nor visions of the days ahead
And as you stand to stretch
You flag down a blue flat bed

",Stuck

She pulls me back in again.

Seeing beneath the surface, faith followed by action
I live it all now, with a hunger and a passion
And when I get stuck I let go and keep mashin'
And when I get stuck, I get still and just ask Him
For knowledge of His will, then my third eye transcends
Thought and everything now's exactly like it's supposed to be
Channel when I'm givin' and give it back out, over beats
Every now and then I think of how things work
All that's fuel for fire now, it's funny how things work
And when I'm flustered and I find I'm slipping back in that space
I see that planet, now it's perfect in the middle of space
And I know that I'm

Findin' out my way somehow
Heard those sounds up in the sky

Cussing, drinking, smoking, killing
Dying, stabbing, shooting, thinking
Walking, pacing, running, falling

Yo, check it out, one time

All the bull stop's here, I'm the matador
Here to introduce a new rap category
Climb on top of my music, mine Matterhorn
Rhyme for rhyme, you don't really want to battle boy
Just another clip added in my catalog
Get your money young playa, I ain't mad at y'all
Here to bring soul like stas-gladisol (?)
Drop the fatter raw verbal mic analog
Sorry y'all, but I didn't bring a Gatt along
Just a pen that does tricks like a magic wand
Get my cadence and a whole rap pattern on
As the sky just falls over Babylon
Travel on Pluto, Venus, Earth, Saturn on
To the place many sane brains haven't gone
When it come to this here
'specially in this year
Frankly I don't have it all

Running, moving, stressing, fussing
Cussing, drinking, smoking, killing
Dying, stabbing, shooting, thinking
Walking, pacing, running, falling
Striving, climbing, scratching, clawing
Growing, knowing, guessing, acting
Working, looking, peeking, seeking
Peeking, counting, seeking, searching

It's the Gift of Gab's new rap seminar
Male groupies please show me where the women are
In a world full of shyst type criminals
Make a LP filled like cinema
Bring light like a rhyme prime minister
Send ya up write it off on adrenaline
On a scale of one to ten it's a ten and a
Half, feel my wrath now, sucka nigga what?
Used to puff on a daily pack of cigarettes
Til I bought a pack of chewin gum, Nicorette
Come to find that I had to get rid of that
Now at shows I got more wind in the set
Wrote a alcohol free song in the next
Thirty days drunk again like hypocrites
Dude, my ego isn't quite that deflated yet
Signed a deal with a major haven't made it yet
Got a past cable bill haven't paid it yet
Crazy wit, now I love my life takin it
Where it hasn't been taken yet
Go against the grain of the rat race daily it's

Rhyme to the rhythm
When I slip in to the zone
And zero deep into the ruse
It's to astonish my opponents
When I'm on it like I own it
Make the whole galaxy call it scripted
Held ya deep within a different world
Lightly, so only are to wane vain main
Never plain, stained brains
Try to elevate from here
Not just to simply maintain
To the vain bang boogie watch my spirit blang blang
I don't need no change of jewelery
I don't need a dang thang
Hang, rappers like you
That don't produce a realer(?) product
It's my soul's interpretation
If you want it, hey I got it
Only so much time allotted
Many thoughts that must be jotted
Clearing out the mind that's clotted
Not I'm writting on some 'Pac shit
In the month of august, take a break out to the farthest
Region on my rocketship
Now y'all MC's can eat my starter
See the crew I rep is Quannum
y'all the bench, we the starters
We the meal, the main course
For your belly, y'all some tottlers
Keep it modest, open honest
I don't claim to be the hardest
Killer, wit' a gun, I really, only want to be a artist
Travel the entire atlas, global trotter
Got a lot a proper type of sharper, riper, I can concentrate(?) to offer

In the middle of the sky, you see my Drella glimpse(?) just passing
Middle of the night, it's dusty, yet it's clear
Like as if you dipping your third eye into a tab of liquid acid
For some pyschedelic clarity to breath within the madness

When you're out and you're far away from home
And your heart and your mind, they start to roam
Fallin' out from the time they spark the zone
Seein' girls from the night they got you stoned

When you're out and you're far away from home
And your heart and your mind, they start to roam
Fallin' out from the time they spark the zone
Seein' girls from the night they got you stoned

Left the planet Earth to get a wider like perspective
On the bigger picture, now I'm steady cruising through the nebula
Headed out to Mars, with souls and minds are more connected
Built with elders how to conquer
Ignorance the mighty predator
I be the cosmic editor
And when it rains I let it pour
And if I'm sure I'm Thor, I guess I'll be the lyric pedd-a-ler
I'm deadly with the medley
Steady, ready with the metaphor
MC's are R.I.P. if they love life they why they said it for?
Headed for your head, it's gonna erupt, I'm blowing up
And popping this, it's cool I be the judge and jury
With the Johnny Cochran savvy, plus I hit the cabby green up really often
When I'm rocking like I rock it now, stopping is not an option
How a biased force subsided, never will run outta ammo
Used to build with pharoahs, riding through the desert on a camel
Ran into a camel by the name of Joe thought he was wacko
All he did was smile and pose and get my folks hooked on tobacco
I crackle as I rap, I pro attack a slacker
Never clever, sever heads
I'm clever, yes, I'll never dread a battle
If they white, they put they thumbs up up like fists if it's an afro
In the Bay I'm hella tight and plus I'm filthy in Seattle

In the middle of the sky, you see my Drella glimpse(?) just passing
Middle of the night, it's dusty, yet it's clear
Like as if you dipping your third eye into a tab of liquid acid
For some pyschedelic clarity to breath amongst the madness

I was infatuated by your stature
It's like I knew your soul before somewhere in the hereafter
Straight off the top connection conversation and some laughter
I feel I got to have ya
Though the friendship part we mastered to go and past that
Like make it a little complicated at times I stand back
And wonder if I'm missing my appointment on your M-track line
I really think it's time for you and me to pass that line

Many have tried and I know that few have been chosen
But when I'm with you I just get the sense that fate is closing in
I'm frozen in time, it's more than just you being a dyme
I see the other half of me when I look in your eyes, reflection
Soul connection for feeling circles, still working on myself
You too, I work with you through this cold world
There's no girl, that's making me do
The things I gotta do to betta get ta-ta-ta

You're everything that I ever been looking for in a lady
Should I just ignore it? and move forward?
Set's sort to assure us a fortune and build a fortress transcending metamorphis
Take a vacation out in europe, leave the whole continent tourin
Can't get enough of what you keep givin me more
And holding it back has got me torn in half

To the ink on the paper from the top of the brain
Ghetto youth zone rythms that are louder than pain
From Suedo to Cali it's all the same, people in chains
Where H2O Children cock it back and take aim
See, just the other day I was catchin' a cab
The driver came from his country to America to grab
A slice of the pie, he said my people haven't seen
The extremeness of hard times, I said ""what you mean?""
He said it's people in his country that would love to live
Inside these ghetto's, they live inside of shacks, and the kids
Don't see any kinds of education, boys and girls
Starve and die, and no money when your country is third world
I said ""I yearn for change all over the map
From a system deeply rooted in hate, it sets traps
Crack, liquor stores, guns, plus our culture was robbed
And we was sought, self-hated, major belief that God
Was outside, denied free thought, feelin' the pressure
Of the hellish eternity visions of, the oppressor
With the long white beard, lookin' down I keep, hopin' it
'll change 'til then, please don't expect me to get over it""
Before I bounced out, I said ""Peace, love
Ain't no reason why nobody need to suffer in pov-
Erty, while others gettin' richer it's the same old song""
Before I closed the door and bounced I told him ""change gon' come""
See I know they don't tell us that we really of Gods
Dwellin' in infinity, through the power of now
I spread the good Karma out, grab a pen a sheet
And empty out my mind, so the ancestors can speak through me
I tweak the beats, rock, eat the beats up
Dwellin' in the Fourth Dimension of spirit I'm Goin' Up
And it can't stop, don't stop, won't stop, ain't gon' stop
Aim for the top, straight blowin' up

Running through rhythms
Proceeding in the torch lights
Floating on melodies
Helping make my thoughts glide
Staidly berated through music I'm off my
Rocker rockin' into the depths of the lost god
Jumping off a climb in the faith I'm a fall guy
Never falling though, in the heavens we all fly
Fourth Dimension rocketships telling ya all why
Wake up from ya slumber my children it's all lies
Money just like everything else, it all dies
Itself is lost and it's still, ""Can I get a dime sack?""

'Cause true wealth resides deep inside

Give what it's channeling through me without no thinking
About it, no doubt about it, part of my beating
Came into open the spirit and let you see in

Poor is getting poorer so niggaz just take dough
Scratching and surviving and seein ya stay broke
Cultivating image instead of the great soul
Cultivate an image but it was all for show
Blow up, explode, didn't it erupt way though
Millions of dollars does not a mortal make whole
You can only take what you've given away though, come on

Admiro as fases dessa lua

Que sou sua estrada, seu caminho, seu projeto, sua direção

In the veil of the night

For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground

Where an old man of Aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night

For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you
I got plans for us

Nights in the scullery
And days instead of me
I only know what to discuss
Of for anything but light

Wise men fighting over you
It's not me you see
Pieces of valentine
With just a song of mine

To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold
Wise men fold
Near a tree by a river

There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon

In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you

I got time to kill
Sly looks in corridors
Without a plan of yours
A blackbird sings on bluebird hill

Thanks to the calling of the wild

Gigi D'Alessio,"Sembrava una ragazza fusa
Le coprivano anche il naso quegli occhiali
Senza età
Per qualche brufolo sul viso rimaneva
Chiusa in casa con la sua malinconia
Che le faceva compagnia
Ed io la odiavo
Vestita da buttare via
Dava quella nostalgia di una vecchia ferrovia
Sembrava fatta con la cera
Della luna qualche sera era l’altra sua metà
Caduta sopra la città, ed io
La odiavo
Lo sguardo nero di un guerriero
50 chili di mistero mi portava sfiga
Come un gatto nero, come un miracolo annunciato
Quell’anatroccolo è cambiato ed io
Se avevo il tempo di pensare
Che nell'odio c’era amore
Ero ‘o primm’ a ma vasà
Forse gli occhiali
Quei suoi vestiti, so stete a me ‘mbruglià
Si travestiva fino al cuore
Quella strega dell’amore, me facette annammurà
Vorrei gridare per non morire
C'è un altro al posto mio
La storia che t’ho raccontato
È un ricordo del passato che divido insieme a te
Da quando lei si è innamorata
Ho perduto un grande amico ma non l’hai capito mai
Solo stasera scoprirai
Che io l’amavo
Sarò un vigliacco per amore, facevo finta di pensare
Che portava sfiga come un gatto nero
Dell'”anotroccolo sposato” io sono ancora innamorato
Addio
Se avevo il tempo di pensare
Che nell'odio c’era amore
Ero ‘o primm’ a ma vasà
Forse gli occhiali
Quei suoi vestiti, so stete a me ‘mbruglià

Gigi D'Alessio,"Sta scoppiando l'alba e la città
Sta svegliando pure noi e le nostre incomprensioni
Mi regali un altro giorno in più di nevrosi e di tabù
Con le solite ossessioni
Solo con un po' di fantasia, io ti vedo
A modo mio, ma vorrei mandarti via
Poi ritorno a stare male, si raffredda il mio motore
Quella che sognavo non sei tu
Poi mi sveglio e trovo accanto a me
Il tuo corpo senza te, che mi dai
Per far l'amore, tutto il resto l'hai portato via
Qui non è più casa sua, tu vuoi somigliare a Dio
E tagliando a pezzi il cuore mio, ogni giorno butti via
Quel che resta del mio amore
Vorrei morire lontano da te
Ma per morire ho bisogno di te
Vorrei comprare quel vuoto per dare al tuo corpo
Anche l'anima
Scusami
Se con te sono stato nel letto
Anche a volte romantico
Io credevo ad un'amore che supera tutti
Gli ostacoli, regalandoti tutto me stesso e mai
Niente a metà
Scusami se ho cenato con te qualche volta
Coi fiori sul tavolo
E ho rubato dai libri le frasi più belle da scrivere
Pronto pure a portarti la luna dal cielo qua giù
Potevi dirmelo che i tempi cambiano
Ed io capivo che forse l'amore non era così
Non emozionarti in quest'addio
Non è giusto amore mio
Non ti sto mandando al diavolo
Sapessi quanto ho bisogno di te, ma tu non hai più
Interesse per me, è senza prezzo quel vuoto
Per dare al tuo corpo anche l'anima
Scusami
Se con te sono stato nel letto
Anche a volte romantico
Io credevo ad un'amore che supera tutti
Gli ostacoli, regalandoti tutto me stesso e mai

Gigi D'Alessio,"Parlava poco italiano diceva te gusta la Spagna
Aveva gli occhi arrossati dall'acqua dei mari del sud
L'avevo vista una notte ballare un focoso flamenco
A piedi nudi col viso sudato vicino ad un falò
Sbagliando i passi le stavo vicino ballando una samba
Era la donna più bella che c'era alla Playa del Sol
In poco tempo il suo sguardo al mio cuore gli dava tormento
All'improvviso m'ha stretto la mano e m'ha detto così

Bésame siente como suena el corazón
Yo esta noche quiero solo un emoción
Sembravo un angelo dagli occhi teneri
Chiedeva un attimo da mille brividi

Bésame siente como suena el corazón
E il suo sorriso nelle labbra mi fermò
Non era un angelo, ma forse un diavolo
E quella notte nel fuoco il mio cuore con lei si bruciò

En esa noche bailando recuerdo me dijo te quiero
Como una niña en mis brazos me hablaba palabras de amor
Intensamente su cuerpo buscaba caricias y besos
En esa noche mintieron sus ojos y me dijo adiós

Amore mio
Se stai dormendo
Mi dispiace metto giù
Pensavo a noi
Dimmi cos'hai
Sei stata zitta
Tutto il tempo in pizzeria
È strano ma
Sai che mi va
Parlare quando dorme tutta la città
Coraggio dai
Io sono qua
Ad ascoltare se qualcosa più non va
Il telefono dà forza e tu lo sai
Mi puoi dire quel che non diresti mai
Anche il fatto che ogni tanto ci ripensi a quella storia
E se stai male
Arrangiati bella mia

E va bene così
Me ne vado da te non ti cercherò più
Non ti chiamerò più ti cancello dall'anima

Dimmi almeno chi sei
Per trattarmi così
Quanto male mi fai e poi Marco lo sai
Non va giù manco ai tuoi

E va bene così
Me ne vado da te
Il motivo ce l'ho
Anche se morirò farò finta di vivere
Sarà difficile per me trovare un'altra come te
Che sintonizza cuore ed anima

Ma cosa fai
Non parli più
Senti dei passi e allora spegni la TV
Poi dici che
Senza un perchè
Sto litigando qui al telefono con te
Queste cose sanno un po' di gelosia
Ma in amore è giusto pure che ci sia
Sarà forse che il tuo primo fidanzato

Passando per casa tua

E va bene così
Non parliamone più

Sono pieno di te non ho il vuoto nell'anima

Non ti dico mai più
Me ne vado da te
Per ferirti così
Sono stato un po' stupido

Scusa ancora però
Tu non piangere più
Altrimenti lo so
Corro e vengo da te per baciarti le lacrime

È troppo grande sai 
Ma è giusto che nel male fa più male questo addio 
Sai quanti giorni inutili 
Aspettano anche me 
Ricordi malinconici 
Che odorano di te 

Via 
Un taglio a tutto e via 
Senza pensarci più 
Quello che adesso voglio non è quello che vuoi tu 
Ma restare fa male anche a te 
Io domani non so dove andrò che farò, 
Tanto non morirò sono morto già qui 
Nel lasciarti stasera. 
Resta lì dove sei non guardarmi così 
Mentre vado, lo so che se piangi per me, 
È un po' quasi tornare 
L'amore vuole amore e tu lo sai 

Via 
Allora vado via 
Che cosa vuoi che sia 
Ho appena fatto fuori quasi mezza vita mia 
Fino a ieri divisa con te",Via

Gigi D'Alessio,"Vorrei darti la mia vita e tu lo sai
È iniziato come un gioco tra di noi
Sapevamo che finiva tutto lì
Due giorni al massimo
Il tuo sguardo un po' imbrociato come mai
Compromessi con il cuore non ne fai
Tu mi vuoi sempre vicino
Come il sole del mattino
Non riesci ad immaginarti senza me
Io promesse giuro non le ho fatte mai
Sono stato sempre chiaro e tu lo sai
Ma il silenzio del tuo cuore
Non fa rima con l'amore
Hai bisogno di restare qui con me

Insieme a lei
Quello che ho fatto lo sa Dio
Ma come faccio a regalarti il posto suo
Sarebbe come il paradiso senza gli angeli
E poi in amore non si può giocare in tre
Insieme a lei
Ne ho fatte di fotografie
Ci sono scritte date e pezzi di poesie
M'ha regalato senza mai stancarsi l'anima
E io non posso farla piangere per te
Tu sei la neve e lei rimane sempre il sole
Ragazza mia

E non dirmi che ti lascio qui nei guai
Che il dolore non potrà passarti mai
Se si muore per amore
Io non posso immaginare
Che sia lei a dover morire senza me
Ma io promesse giuro non ne ho fatte mai
Sono stato sempre chiaro e tu lo sai
Si dividono le strade
Tanti auguri buona vita
Non odiarmi quando poi mi penserai

L'emozione mi rende nervoso lo sai
Faccio un po' ridere
Per quanto tempo ho cercato il tuo numero io
Una volta ti giuro l'ho chiesto anche a Dio
Come uno stupido
Se ti amo ancora sai
È fuori luogo ormai

Io che non vivo
Da solo senza te
Non riesco più a dormire
E se lo voglio fare
Io metto in un bicchiere 20 goccie tra le lacrime
Ma dentro i sogni miei
Ci siamo sempre noi, tu non mi crederai

Io che non vivo da quando no ci sei
Vorrei strapparti il cuore se penso
A quella sera
Che a Marco gli hai nascosto la mia foto
Fra le bambole
Non te l'ho detto mai, era un amico mio

Dove andrai vorrei starti appiccicato addosso
Tu lo sai, che continuo a ripensarti spesso
Guarda la faccia che ho fatto
Dicendoti addio
Senza avere uno specchio lo immagino anch'io

che un amico sta male

Il tempo sembra strisciare passando più lento del solito
Senza lei
Che amare un'altra mi sembra davvero qualcosa di stupido
Che vita inutile
Senza lei
Bevo fumando e poi mangio bocconi di picco le lacrime
Son diventato pensandoci bene anche un povero diavolo
E se mi guardo allo specchio mi sembro più vecchio in un attimo
Chissà se impazzirò
Si può pur andar giù dal balcone
Dare un calcio più forte al portone
Ma non senti lo stesso dolore
Quel sapore di morte nel cuore se tu non ci sei
Dove sei
Maledettissimo pezzo di stella cadendo hai colpito il mio cuore
Lo sai

Dove sei
Senza di te nella vita magari le altre bastavano
Per sopravvivere
Dove sei
Se fossi stato un miraggio la bolla d'amore scoppiava in un
Attimo e poi

Senza te
Mi regalavo nei letti di chi al momento mi desidera
Potevo vivere così
Senza lei
Ho cominciato a vedere l'amore come qualcosa di cinico
L'indifferenza è il vestito che metto ogni sera di solito
Ho quasi voglia di spegnere l'ultima fiamma dell'anima
Ma poi si arrabbia Dio
La mia febbre continua a salire
Quanto male che sento nel cuore
Ho paura non voglio morire

Se non ti accarezza quando fa l'amore 
Se ti fa dormire e non ti fa sognare

Ma farai soltanto parte del suo ieri 
Come ha fatto già con tanti vecchi amori 

Tutti quei progetti sul futuro 
Dentro le valige li hai portati via con te 
Sopra un treno che non avrà stazioni E hai lasciato il nostro sul binario morto come me 
A chi darò il biglietto di quel posto tuo Con chi tu stai viaggiando che non sono io 

Cosa te ne fai di un altro uomo 
Se ti fa volare e poi cadere 
Se quando ti abbraccia non gli batte il cuore 
Sentirai il suo gelo e non il mio calore Cosa te ne fai di un altro uomo 
Tu non ci sarai nel suo domani 
Ma farai soltanto parte del suo ieri

Se per lui le lacrime sono acqua e sale 
Non potrà capire mai chi muore per amore",Cosa te ne fai di un altro uomo

Mentre il vestito scivolava giù 
Il suo respiro quasi a soffocarti 
Le mani dove non volevi tu 
E dai vieni qui 
È solo un gioco nuovo fidati 
Non fare così 
Non puoi scappare vengo a prenderti 

Occhi di mare grandi come stelle 
Un vento nero le ha portate via 
Figli di nuvole I tuoi capelli 
Lui come un treno e tu la ferrovia

Parole crude come un fulmine 
E stava già li 
Come un falco su una rondine

Dove l'alba che nasce fa crescere un fiore che gira col sole 
Tu stammi vicino 
Io ti porto con me 
Per dormire abbracciati con le guance poggiate sullo stesso cuscino 

Questa vita spesso lascia lividi 
E pugni in faccia quanti non si sa 
E all'improvviso ti cancella I sogni 
Ma se l'ascolti poi te li ridà 
Ma io sono qui 
Come un pittore per dipingerti 
E resto così 
Come un aquila a difenderti 

Ma io solo qui 
Filo d'aria fra I respiri tuoi 
Adesso così 
Voleremo insieme quando vuoi 

Tu dammi la mano 
Io ti porto con me 
Dove soffierà il vento che porta lontano il dolore che hai dentro 
Tu stammi vicino 
Io ti porto con me 
Dove l'onda del mare cancella per sempre le impronte dal cuore 

Cieli azzurri e voli liberi 
Le tue ali non si fermeranno più 
Torneranno a librare 
Dentro a un arco a colori 

Tu dammi la mano 
Io ti porto con me 
Dove il cado d'aprile scioglie le neve la sposa col fiume 
Tu dammi la mano 
Io ti porto con me 
Dove danza una foglia che cada sull'acqua ma non fa rumore

Ma il silenzio te ne fa di più 
Ma se vuoi nel cielo delle rondini 
Io come un aquila ti porto su",Il  falco e la rondine
Gigi D'Alessio,"Metti le mie scarpe e viaggia come ho fatto io 
E vedrai che sono un uomo mica sono un Dio 
L’uomo che hai davanti nella vita ha stretto i denti 
Ha capito che si muore solo se ti arrendi 
Quanti giorni per il mondo solo per suonare 
Quanti aereoplani e la paura di volare 
Ho trovato un figlio già cresciuto che parlava 
Io non ho una foto insieme a lui quando giocava 
Quante notti e quante lune storte 
Con le mani sopra un pianoforte 
Calda e amara l’acqua che ho bevuto 
Quanti piatti freddi che ho mangiato 
Quante notti e quante lune storte 
E non arrivava mai la sorte 
Ho comprato soldi da un mercante 
Perché in tasta non avevo niente 
Io 
Che ho sempre fatto tutto quanto a modo mio 
Mettendo in gioco quello che non era tuo 
Se chiedi vedi bene prima quel che dai 
La vita da quello che non ti aspetti mai 
Metti la mia pelle e viaggia come ho fatto io 
E vedrai quanto sudore che ho buttato via 
E se durante il mio cammino ho fatto anche un sorriso 
Vedi bene che c’è dietro forse è solo un caso 
Ora che mi vedi e dici sono un uomo duro 
Tu non sai quanto ho sbattuto questa faccia al muro 
Le mie sofferenze ti assicuro sono tante 
Mi ha tradito sempre quello a cui ho dato il sangue 
Quante notti e quante lune storte 
Un funambolo su funi sciolte 
C’era solo una finestra aperta 
Ma non era quella mai la porta 
Quante notti e quante lune storte 
Ed un fegato incazzato a morte 
Mi rialzavo e ricadevo a terra 
Mi suonavano tamburi a guerra

Gigi D'Alessio,"Sei più bella ancora questa sera,
Così bella giuro, non ti ho vista mai,
C'è una luce accesa sopra quel tuo viso,
Hai un sorriso bianco da pubblicità.

Se ti avessi conosciuto prima,
Non ti avrei cercato e amato dopo lei,
Tu come una stella guidi il mio cammino
Per cambiare il mio destino.

Occhi nuovi
Per innamorarmi,
Occhi veri
Come I tuoi pensieri,
Occhi chiari
Vivi e più sinceri,
Occhi nuovi
Per I nostri cuori

C'era in torno a me terra bruciata,
Solo fumo ed io non respiravo più,
Poi come una nuova pagina di vita,
Oggi vivo e ti respiro.

Occhi nuovi
Per innamorarmi,
Occhi veri
Come I tuoi pensieri

Adesso sento il cuore,
Non ci credevo più,
Ancora posso amare
Se me lo chiedi tu,
Sei come ti sognai,
C'era la luna spenta
E il sole non usciva mai.

Occhi nuovi
Per innamorarmi.

Gigi D'Alessio,"Ricordo I primi passi in musica, 
E dopo un po' l'esame senza un pianoforte no ancora no 
Mia madre forza che ce la farai, ancora un po'. 
Mi ripeteva ""Non mollare mai"" 
Le prime feste con gli amici miei
Suoniamo un pò. 
Una canzone poi la scriverò 
E la canterò ma I primi dischi alla radio non suonavano
Sognavo un santo ed un microfono.. 

Ora, 
Io sono vivo adesso e canto ancora, 
Con la mia gente sogno e piango ancora. 
In ogni mio concerto, volo ancora. 
E' sempre primavera. 
Ora, 
Con le tue braccia vivo e amo ancora, 
Quante emozioni mi regali ancora. 
Sei tu il mio vecchio e nuovo amore ancora. 
E' questa la mia storia. 

La prima volta in un teatro, ma non c'eri tu, 
C'era mio padre che piangeva 
Ora non c'è più' 
Perché la vita da ma prende sempre un po' di più' 
E quel che prende non ritorna mai

Ora, 
Io sono vivo adesso e canto ancora, 
Dal palco tra le luci cerco ancora.. 
I vostri occhi nei miei occhi ancora. E sono un brivido alla schiena
Ora, 
Ho tanta voglia di sentirvi ancora… 
Gridare il nome mio più' forte ancora 
Cantare le canzoni a memoria tra un bacio nuovo e una parola

Chi mi odia io non odierò 
Nemmeno un pò. 
Odiare è un sentimento che non ho
Certo lo so .. Posso piacere poco Oppure no
Ma se non sai un uomo tu non giudicarlo mai
Ora, 
Voglio sentire che ci siete ancora per non svegliarmi dal mio sogno ancora.. 
Voglio il calore di un abbraccio ancora per continuare la mia storia.. 
Ora, 
A chi mi ha dato gioia, pane e cuore, 
Io dico grazie con questa canzone
La dedico a voi tutti con amore
E a me che ho scritto musica e parole",Ora
Gigi D'Alessio,"Ti diranno che sei già finito ormai 
Quelle parole taglieranno come lame 
Non avrai niente da dire
E non c'è niente da fare
In un attimo il tuo cuore è alla deriva. 
Nella vita ad un traguardo non si è mai, 
Non c'è meta se non sei sulla montagna, 
Il tuo pane avrà il sapore della polvere 
Dovrai solo non dimenticarlo mai. 
Farai a pugni con la rabbia di ogni giorno 
E la voglia di spaccare il mondo in due 
Ma capirai che nonostante le incertezze 
Sarà più forte la tua voglia di sognare sempre!!! 
Mai non lasciarti andare mai 
Tutto torna prima o poi 
I confini le ferite e I calci in faccia 
Vaie guarda oltre finché puoi 
Oltre le barriere 
Oltre l'ultimo respiro mai 
Non lasciarti andare mai 
Resta sempre quel che sei 
E vedrai che in questa vita tutto torna prima o poi
 
Ti diranno di aspettare il turno tuo 
E le spinte porteranno sempre indietro 
Ma nel carro della vita 
Non c'è mai l'ultima ruota 
Non è detto siano gli altri a decidere per te 
Mangerai con l'arroganza degli uomini 
In un piatto pieno solo di bugie 
Ma la vita insegna ad essere più forti 
E a camminare solo con le gambe tue sempre 
Mai non lasciarti andare mai 
Tutto torna prima o poi 
I confini le ferite e I calci in faccia 
Vai e guarda oltre finché puoi 
Oltre le barriere 
Oltre l'ultimo respiro mai 
Non lasciarti andare mai 
Resta sempre quel che sei 
E vedrai che in questa vita tutto torna
Giorni di silenzi che nessuno ascolterà 
Con il cuore appeso a un filo starai li 
A difenderti da tutto e tutti 
Perchè in questa vita vince solo chi sa essere migliore 
Mai non lasciarti andare mai 
Tutto torna prima o poi 
I confini le ferite e I calci in faccia, vai
Non lasciarti andare mai 
E vedrai che in questa vita 
Non è mica già finita 
Tutto torna prima o poi",Prima o poi
Gigi D'Alessio,"Sarà solo un momento 
Vedrai che passerà 
Parole 
Buttate 
Qua e là 
E non è una ragione 
Ti vesti e te ne vai 
Ma tutta questa fretta che hai 
Mi fa pensare 
Abbiamo superato crisi 
E tanti giorni amarti 
Noi soli contro il mondo 
Ma abbiamo vinto noi 

Ti prometto che sarò la luce quando si fa sera 
Nel buio della notte 
Sarò vicino a te 
Con il fuoco brucerò la neve che ti arriva al cuore 
Se scoppia un temporale 
Lo porterò lontano 
Perchè fa rumore 

Ti chiedo ancora scusa 
Del tempo perso ormai 
Ma tutto poi si aggiusta vedrai 
Sarà meglio di adesso 
Pensavo solo al mio lavoro 
Che a starti più vicino 
Lasciarsi non è vita 
La vita siamo noi 

Ti prometto che sarò nei passi tuoi ovunque andrai 
Ti porterò per mano 
Senza lasciarti mai 
Sarò l'ombra della tua figura e non avrai paura 
Meraviglioso dono 
Per ogni giorno perso chiederò perdono 

Non oso immaginarti sola 
Poi con un altro uomo 
Morirei solo al pensiero di vederti e non sentirti più mia 
Vieni qui ridi un pò fai così ora dai dimmi si almeno una parola 
Se mi ami ancora 

Ti prometto che sarai per sempre in ogni mio respiro 
Riportami nel cuore e prova questa sera a richiamarmi amore",Prova a richiamarmi amore
Gigi D'Alessio,"Ma chi sei 
Un brutto imbroglio una donna 
Un mistero insoluto intrigato col volto di una madonna 
Sei una scatola chiusa 
Chiusa dentro una chiesa 
E mi trovo a pregare per te 

Sei un serpente a sonagli che mangia il cuore 
Sei l'incanto che danza davanti a me 
Con quel bacio al veleno che fa morire 
La speranza davvero per me non c'è 
Sei un violino che suona e mi fa stordire 
Una strega che mille poteri ha 
Come piovra mi avvolgi per stritolare 
Con le braccia mi stringi senza pietà 

Vittima 
Io sono sai la tua preda ormai 
Che non ragiona più 
Senza reazioni mi piego al volere 

Sei una scatola chiusa 
Chiusa dentro a una chiesa 
E ritorno a pregare per te 

Sei un serpente di mare pericoloso 
Che mi attende di certo poi morderà 
Sei una tigre nell'erba dall'occhio ombroso 
Che in un pazzo ad un tratto mi attaccherà 

Vittima 
Io sono sai la tua preda ormai 
Che non ragiona più 
Senza reazioni mi piego al volere 

Vittima 
Io sono sai la tua preda ormai 
Che non ragiona più 
Senza reazioni mi piego al volere 

Tu sei un'aquila voli con grandi artigli 
Poi ti getti in picchiata e arrivi giù 
Io cammino ignaro e tu mi pigli 
Ed improvviso nel cielo mi porti su",Serpente a sonagli

Mani in altro arrendetevi

Sorridenti I vampiri,che Dio salvi gli emiri.

Bla bla bla che si fa, qui la nave affonda e loro discutono.

Dove vai, dove sei, bella patria di poeti e di tanti eroi. 
Tornerai, prima o poi,quella bella donna madre di tutti noi.

Questa notte Italiana.

Gigi D'Alessio,"Al pianoforte nasce un na na na na na 
Quel tuo maglione lungo sulle mani 
Poi cerca un ritornello che ti arriva dritto al cuore 
Così per suo mestiere il cantautore 

A volte la tonalità 
Può essere sbagliata 
Là scende un tono ed è una passeggiata 

Se la fai maggiore è nato un nuovo amore 
Il la minore diventano più tristi le sue storie 
Fanno piangere di più 
Se il bemolle scende giù 
Il diesis sale su! 

Il basso quando suona insieme con la batteria 
Ti fanno il groub senza l'armonia 
Se una chitarra fa un assolo urla e si dimena 
E' come per Ulisse e una sirena 
E mettere le viole, i violoncelli ed i violini 
Ma un solo ritmo fa coi mandolini 

Se la fai maggiore è nato un nuovo amore 
Il la minore diventano più tristi le sue storie 
Fanno piangere di più 
Se il bemolle scende giù 
Il diesis sale su! 

Ma son canzoni 
Per tutti i sognatori, cantautori 
Non siamo dei profeti e dei dottori 
Santi non saremo noi 
Forse idoli per voi

On a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named wildfire
With a whirlwind by her side

And the pony she named wildfire
Busted down his stall
And in a blizzard he was lost

She ran calling wildfire

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Once that you've decided on a killing 
First you make a stone of your heart 
And if you find that your hands are still willing 
Then you can turn a murder into art 

There really isn't any need for bloodshed 
You just do it with a little more finesse 
If you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee 
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess 

It's murder by numbers  one  two  three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three

Now if you have a taste for this experience 
And you're flushed with your very first success 
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome 
And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less 

Because murder is like anything you take to 
It's a habit-forming need for more and more 
You can bump off every member of your family 
And anybody else you find a bore 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC

that was not enough.

somehow i can not believe that it would be enough for me to melt with you and integrate without the thoughts of rape and murder. i cannot conceive of peace on earth until i have given you a piece of lead or pipe to end your worthless motherfucking exitence. imagine your nightmares of my sneaking into a vieled of satin bedroom and attacking your daughter, wife and mother at once ripping open their bowels sexually like a wishbone. imagine that magnified a million times when you realize that the blinders have been stripped from my eyes and I realize that slavery was no smiling happy-fizzy party. your ancestors raped my foremothers and i will not forget. i will not forget that Yale or Harvard or Princeton or In-Hell because you are on my mind. i see you everytime my woman walks down the street with her ass on her shoulders. i see you everytime i look in the mirror and think about the times that i would pat myself on the back for not being too black afterall. i think of you morning, noon and night and i wonder, ""just exactly what in hell is enough?"" everytime i see a rope or gun i remember, and to top it all of you ain't through yet. over fifty you have killed in mississippi since 1963. that doesn't even begin to begin all of those you have maimed, hit and run over, blinded, poisoned, starved, or castrated. i hope you do not think that a vote for John Kennedy took you off my shit-list because in the street there will only be black and white. there will be no Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, Conservatives, Moderates, or any other of the rest of that shit you have used to make me forget to hate.
there ain't no enough. there ain't no surrender. there is only plot and plan, move and groove, kill. there is no promise land. there is only the promise. the promise is not vowel until we have been nerve gassed, shot down and murdered, or done some of the same ourselves. look over your shoulder motherfucker, i am coming.",Enough

Or lost in battles or broken
Unless the homes of firemen, policemen, construction workers,

Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Gilad Hekselman,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast

My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast

Gilbert Bécaud,"PAUVRE PECHEUR


Toi qui traines ta vie comme un filet de pêche
En marchant tête nue vers les voix de l’amour
Tu sauras qu’ici bas où chacun se dépêche,
Les joies éparpillées font aller et retour
Tu regardes le ciel comme un cadeau de noce,
Tu espères de lui des escaliers d’argent
Et puis, désabusé, tu reroules ta bosse
En courant comme un fou parmi les océans
Sur ton beau navire 
Qui a pour nom « Janot du matin »
Il y a le bon le pire 
Que tu tiens entre tes deux mains
Toi qui pêches au soleil, pauvre pêcheur de lune
Toi qui pêches à la lune, pauvre pêcheur d’été
Tu essaies d’attraper les étoiles une à une
Et chacune est pour toi ta pièce de monnaie

Tu ressembles, vois-tu, à ce voleur poète 
Qui fabriquait, dit-on, il y a déjà longtemps
Avec beaucoup de soins, car il était honnête
Des pièces de cent sous qui lui coûtaient dix francs
Je ne sais pas pourquoi on dit en Angleterre :
« Chaque verre qui tinte est un marin qui meurt.»
Que ce soir, s’il vous plaît, il ne tinte aucun verre,
J’aurai trop de soucis pour mon pauvre pêcheur ! 
Sur son beau navire
Qui a pour nom « Janot du matin »
Il est parti sans rien dire
En me tendant la main.",Pauvre Pêcheur

Et l'on a chanté

Du champagne de France

Pour toujours dans la nuit
Emporteront ta vie
Mais puisque tu le sais

Reviens
Et tout comme autrefois
Elles frémiront pour toi
Dans la joie retrouvée

Reviens

Gilbert Bécaud,"Mes mains
Dessinent dans le soir
La forme d'un espoir
Qui ressemble à ton corps

Mes mains
Quand elles tremblent de fièvre
C'est de nos amours brèves
Qu'elles se souviennent encore

Mes mains
Caressent dans leurs doigts
Des riens venant de toi
Cherchant un peu de joie

Mes mains
Se tendent en prière
Vers ton ombre légère
Disparue dans la nuit

Mes mains
Elles t'aiment à la folie
D'un amour infini
Elles t'aiment pour la vie

As-tu déjà effacé ce passé qui m'obsède?
As-tu déjà oublié que ces mains ont tout donné?

Mes mains
Qui voudraient caresser
Un jour seront lassées
D'attendre ton retour

Mes mains
Elles iront te chercher
Là où tu t'es cachée
Avec un autre amour

Mes mains
Méprisant les prières
Trembleront de colère
Et je n'y pourrai rien

Mes mains
Pour toujours dans la nuit
Emporteront ta vie
Mais puisque tu le sais

Reviens
Et tout comme autrefois
Elles frémiront pour toi
Dans la joie retrouvée

Reviens
Ne les repousse pas
Ces mains tendues vers toi
Et donne-leur tes mains",Mes Mains [Olympia 1955]
Gilbert Bécaud,"Gare de Lyon Le jour se lève 
Moi j'ai pas fini mon rève 
Café noir douche glacée 
Difficile de se reveiller 
Ca me tient commu une fièvre 
Ce goût de Toi sur mes fèvres 
Et je pense à toi encore une fois 

Vite l'ascenseur la voiture 
Ca démarre à tout allure 
La radio joue des chansons 
Je suis coincé à la Nation 
Huit heures et quart fin Novembre 
Pourquoi on vit pas ensemble 
Et je pense à toi encore une fois 

Le bureau les secrétaires 
Les affreux et les affaires 
Ce téléphone merveilleux 
Vous avez Berlin sur la deux 
see'est jamais toi qui m'appelle 
""Auf wieder sehn Mademoiselle"" 
Et je pense à toi encore une fois 

Réunion pour une campagne 
On lance un nouveau champagne 
Je n'ai pas lu le dossier 
Marketing et publicité 
Tiens, à propos de Champagne 
Ca me donne des idées 
Et je pense à toi encore une fois 

Déjeuner avec la presse 
Explications en vitesse 
J'ai le coeur, la tête ailleurs 
Il n'est pas tout à fait quinze heures 
Où est-tu dans cette ville 
J'adore quand tu te maquilles 
Et je pense à toi encore une fois 
Et puis j'arrive à mon étage 

Tu m'as laisse un message 
Un numéro où t'appeler 
Qui sonne toujours occupé 
On m'appelle sur l'autre ligne 
Je te rappelle impossible 
J'ai besoin de toi encore une fois 
Quelque part je t'imagine 
Devant ces mures de vitrines 

On s'est donné rendez Vous 
Est-ce que tu te souviendras où 
Ce café de Montparnasse 
Dix neuf heures comme le temps passe 
J'ai envie de toi encore une fois 
Je suis un peu en avance 
Devant mon whisky d'urgence 
Tu viendras, tu viendras pas 

Je me raconte n'importe quoi 
Allez barman la même chose 
Je fredonne ""La vie en Rose"" 
Je suis dans un état encore une fois 
Et puis d'un coup tu arrives 

Tout d'un coup see'est bon de vivre 
C'est bien ton corps que je touche 
C'est bien ton visage ta bouche 
Vivement que le jour s'achève 
Que je continue mon rève 
J'en peux plus de toi encore une fois 
Et le temps, le temps cavale 

C'est la poursuite infernale 
Les fourmis et les cigales 
Ne voient plus passer les saisons 
see'est demain la fin do monde 
Mais puisqu'on est seul au monde 
On le refera encore une fois

Il laisse les parents accumuler les traites,
Cotiser la retraite, survivre dignement,

Qui monte jusqu'aux eacute toiles pour n'en plus retomber.
Et de mille m'eacutetiers en mille misegraveres,

Gilbert Bécaud,"Mon Dieu qu’il y en a des croix sur cette terre…
Croix de bois, croix de fer
Mumbles croix familières
Petites croix d’argent
Pendues sur les poitrines
Vieilles croix de couvent
Perdues parmi les ruines

Et moi, pauvre de moi
J’ai ma croix dans la tête
L’immense croix de plomb
Vaste comme l’amour
J’y accroche le vent
J’y retiens la tempête
J’y prolonge le soir
Et j’y cache le jour
Et moi, pauvre de moi
J’ai ma croix dans la tête
Un mot y est gravé
Qui ressemble à “souffrir”
Mais ce mot familier
Que mes lèvres répètent
Est si lourd à porter
Que j’en pense mourir

Mon Dieu, qu’il y en a sur les routes profondes
De silencieuses croix qui veillent sur le monde
Hautes croix du pardon
Tendues vers les potences
Croix de la déraison
Ou de la délivrance

Mais moi, pauvre de moi
J’ai ma croix dans la tête
L’immense croix de plomb
Vaste comme l’amour
J’y accroche le vent
J’y retiens la tempête
J’y prolonge le soir
Et j’y cache le jour
Mais moi, pauvre de moi
J’ai ma croix dans la tête

Que mes lèvres répètent
Est si lourd à porter
Que j’en pense mourir",Les Croix
Gilbert Bécaud,"J'avais un seul ami
Et on me l'a tué
Il était plus que lui
Il était un peu moi
Je crois qu'en le tuant
On m'a aussi tué
Et je pleure la nuit
Mais on ne le sait pas

C'était mon copain
C'était mon ami
Pauvre vieux copain
De mon humble pays
Je revois son visage
Au regard généreux
Nous avions le même âge
Et nous étions heureux

Ami, mon pauvre ami
Reverrai-je jamais
Ton sourire gentil
Parmi l'immensité?

C'était mon copain
C'était mon ami
J'écoute la ballade
De la Mort, de la Vie
Le vent de la frontière
Veut consoler mes pleurs
Mais l'eau de la rivière
A d'étranges couleurs

Cependant dans les bois
Un mystérieux concert
M'a dit qu'il faut garder
L'espoir à tout jamais
Car ceux qui ont bâti
Ensemble un univers
Se retrouveront tous
Puisqu'ils l'ont mérité

O mon vieux camarade
Mon copain, mon ami
Parmi les terres froides
Je te parle la nuit
Et ton pesant silence
Est un mal si cruel
Que j'entends ta présence
Parfois au fond du ciel",C'Etait Mon Copain
Gilbert Bécaud,"Tu ressembles à la musique que tu danses
Tu es violence, cadence et décadence

Super gadget de discothèque qui danse, danse

Gilbert Bécaud,"A l'escalier 6, bloc 21,
J'habite un très chouette appartement
Que mon père, si tout marche bien,
Aura payé en moins de vingt ans.
On a le confort au maximum,
Un ascenseur et un' salle de bain.
On a la télé, le téléphone
Et la vue sur Paris, au lointain.
Le dimanche, ma mère fait du rangement
Pendant que mon père, à la télé,
Regarde les sports religieusement
Et moi j'en profit' pour m'en aller.

Je m'en vais le dimanche à Orly.
Sur l'aéroport, on voit s'envoler
Des avions pour tous les pays.
Pour l'après-midi, j'ai de quoi rêver.
Je me sens des fourmis dans les idées
Quand je rentre chez moi la nuit tombée.

A sept heures vingt-cinq, tous les matins,
Nicole et moi, on prend le métro.
Comme on dort encore, on ne se dit rien
Et chacun s'en va vers ses travaux.
Quand le soir je retrouve mon lit,
J'entends les Boeing chanter là-haut.
Je les aime, mes oiseaux de nuit,
Et j'irai les retrouver bientôt.

Oui j'irai dimanche à Orly.
Sur l'aéroport, on voit s'envoler
Des avions pour tous les pays.
Pour toute une vie, y a de quoi rêver.
Un jour, de là-haut, le bloc vingt et un
Ne sera qu'un tout petit point.",Dimanche a Orly
Gilbert Bécaud,"Et maintenant que vais-je faire
De tout ce temps que sera ma vie
De tous ces gens qui m'indiffèrent
Maintenant que tu es partie

Toutes ces nuits, pourquoi pour qui
Et ce matin qui revient pour rien
Ce coeur qui bat, pour qui, pourquoi
Qui bat trop fort, trop fort

Et maintenant que vais-je faire
Vers quel néant glissera ma vie
Tu m'as laissé la terre entière
Mais la terre sans toi c'est petit

Vous, mes amis, soyez gentils
Vous savez bien que l'on n'y peut rien
Même Paris crève d'ennui
Toutes ses rues me tuent

Et maintenant que vais-je faire
Je vais en rire pour ne plus pleurer
Je vais brûler des nuits entières
Au matin je te haïrai

Et puis un soir dans mon miroir
Je verrai bien la fin du chemin
Pas une fleur et pas de pleurs
Au moment de l'adieu

Je n'ai vraiment plus rien à faire
Je n'ai vraiment plus rien",Et Maintenant

Je ne sais pas pourquoi

Plus de mouvement
Plus d'envolée
Bien bien plus léger

Premier concert devant le noir
Je suis seul avec mon piano
Et ça finit par des bravos
Des bravos, j'en cueille par millions
A tous les coins de l'horizon

Des pas qui claquent
Des murs qui craquent
Des pas qui foulent
Des murs qui croulent

Des yeux qui pleurent
Des mains qui meurent
Des pas qui chassent
Des pas qui glacent
Pourquoi
Le ciel est-il si loin de nous?

Brûlant mon corps de haut en bas!

Gilbert Bécaud,"Il avait poussé par hasard
Dans notre cour sans le savoir
Comme un aveugle dans le noir
Mon arbre
Il était si petit
Que c'était mon ami
Car j'étais tout petit
Comme lui
J'attendais de lui le printemps
Avec deux ou trois fleurs d'argent
Un peu de vert, un peu de blanc
Mon arbre
Et ma vie s'accrochait
A cet arbre léger
Qui grandissait
Comme je grandissais

Je savais qu'à force d'amour
Avec un peu d'eau tous les jours
Il ferait exploser la cour
Mon arbre
Qu'il grimperait de joie
Bien par-dessus mon toit
Pour toucher le soleil
De ses doigts
Quand le printemps nous fut donné
Toute la cour le regardait
Se demandant jusqu'où irait
Mon arbre
Mais moi je savais bien
Qu'il irait très très loin
Qu'il monterait jusqu'au soleil
Au moins

Un jour il a fallu gagner
J'ai voyagé, j'ai travaillé
Mais je ne l'ai pas oublié

Si je reviens chez moi
Et s'il est encor là
Qui sait s'il me reconnaîtra

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying: ""My God, that's tough""
""She stood him up""
""No point in us remaining""
""We may as well go home""
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play?
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally",Alone Again Naturally

Am I wasting time
Thinking that you
Will be my dream come true

If the answer is yes
What must I do
If I'm to get to you
It's not as though I haven't tried hard
Even had myself barred
From taking a rest
But like a lot of things in life
When your down
Nothing comes round
That isn't a mess
Dear dream I pray
That you will come my way
Give me a clue
Of how to get to
Of how to get to
Of how to get to you

Get out of clothes

Am I wasting my time
Thinking that you
Will be my dream come
Will be my dream come

Sometimes he thinks he'll go insane
How can he be so close and yet very far
Is there something that he should know
Some place maybe he can go to
In search of you

Only cared about what he could spend
I say to hell with your money fixations
Feels like we've lost a friend

And when i die as i must do
I know it's an awful thing to talk about
And i'd give anything for it never to be true
What a way to make a living digging graves
Still you'd never need to fear being made redundant that way

And for those of you who think that Presley
Only cared about what he could spend
Remember that without him might have been no Lennon
Feels like we've lost a friend

And when i die as i must do
Know it's an awful thing to talk about

That can stop me wanting you
And I do, so help me
I won't feel like having fun

Can I go with you

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I wouldn't be glad wouldn't be sad
I wouldn't be good if I knew what I could
And I hate to go
But I must you know

Duty calls
Niagara falls
See it go down
As it falls on the ground
And gets up again
At the count of ten

I would like everyone here to repeat after me
Something of which I know nothing about
Namely that which I will tell you
(that which I will tell you)
I'm going to school breaking a rule
I'm going around in a pitiful frown
Cause I didn't pass (came)
Bottom of the class (oh! what a shame)

Teacher was mad
So was me dad
Took off his belt
And without any help
Really hit me hard
Where I'd stuck a card

Thick I may be but a fool I am certainly not
Always remember the golden rule
When in no doubt get a car out
And while you're there how about,
Fetching me one of those pneumatic drills
Boy! I really love the sound that they make
So good for the pains and aches of life in general
Don't be such a miser

At the most a fiver's all you pay
Many's the time
I have wondered about what it is
I want you all to repeat after me
Something I know you know I know
(Something I know you know I know)
I wouldn't behold wouldn't be cold
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my

Dear old mum and dad
And the fun they had
Early one night
Dad put out the light
Got hold of me mum
Said he wanted a son
And as you can see
The result was me

Somebody told me once money does not grow on trees
Well if that's true then how do you explain

Not forgetting melons",The Golden Rule
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Did you ever tell somebody you're in love
Like the way I'm telling you I'm in love?

You can tell me how it feels to be loved
Only I can tell you how it feels to be loved
By you, believe me baby, baby by you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Loved, loved by you

Oh life can be short, of that there's no doubt
However I'm not pushed for time
If you can't come out till 'round about nine
By you

When that sun don't shine for me I won't care
Only sunshine that I'll need is waiting there

Waiting there, waiting there
There, there with you

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Living in a town that's on the brink of being a city
 Won't satisfy my soul though the women may be pretty
 My mind is made up
 I have had enough
 I'm leaving here today
 Shops, walls, pavements, streets
 Is all that I could find
 From head to foot and toe to eye
 I looked till I was blind
 No matter what turns up
 I'm leaving here

 You might think that I'm being funny
 Just 'coz I won't spend my money here
 Well let me tell you I have no obection
 Except that I can find correction
 Everywhere I go

 About walking down an empty street
 With gutters full of litter

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Everytime a bell rings
I go berserk
I climb into my hole
And sit there like a mole

Playing with the dirt
Contradicting people who think of me as being
So soft and gentle
Very clean

I used to have a daisy
A purple one called Maisy
Stuck on my bed
It didn't bother me

Yet when the landlord, Freestone saw it he said
Take it out at once or evicted you must go
So here I am in my hole
Watching people pass me by

Each of them in their own world and me in mine
I've never bitten off any more than I can chew
Never wanted too-
Every time a bird sings

Every time a bell rings
I go berserk
And as I've said before
I sit there like a mole

Playing with the dirt
Call it what you like
And by all means tell a soul
I'm very happy in my hole

Running round from time to time
Stopping only to unwind
Everything I have is mine
In my hole

Width about the length of a bowl

Sailed empty handed around the world

Of leading me on

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Once in a while, out of the blue
I might appear somewhat rude
But don't be alarmed or get upset
Just say to yourself this I'll forget
And when I come home after being away
It might do me good just to hear you say
Darlin' don't move an inch, keep perfectly still
Now do with me what you will
Sometime ago before we met
I vowed to myself that I'd never let
No-one at all ever tie me down
Never dreaming that I'd see you around
Now isn't it strange wherever you go
It's always the same with whoever you know
Which just goes to prove what I've been trying to say
Looking at you the way I do (that's love)
Promising always to be true (that's love)
Giving each other a helping hand (that's love)
Sharing each other's every plan, that's love
And in love you do
And isn't it strange wherever you go
It's always the same with whoever you know
Which just goes to prove what I've been dying to say
Holding you now the way I do (that's love)

Knowing inside it must be real, that's love

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Good morning Mary Ann

And how are you upon this bright

And sunny morning

I hear your brother Ted

Got caught for speeding

But was let off with a warning

I hope he's learnt his lesson

And the next time he goes out will drive with care

It doesn't pay to drive too fast

All it does is make your life last shorter



I know you won't believe this

But it happens to be true

I am a loner

My only real companion is dog I'm very fond of

His name's Homer

He follows me wherever I go

And of course I do my best to feed him

It's not the easiest of tasks

When you consider unlike cats

They're broader



Do what you want to within reason

But remember take your time

Nothing stops for those

Who can't afford to wait

The best advice that I can give you

Is to hold on to your head

And as long as you are good and kind

You'll always be a friend of mine

And it's true to say that a good friend is hard to find

But I'd like to think that you are

A friend of mine



Good morning Sarah Jane

And how are you today

Tell me is that your mother

She looks a lot like you

Though come to think of it

You look like one another

It's funny how with likenesses

Most people have a difference of opinion

They said that I was like my dad

Now they say that I'm just like his daughter



Do what you want to within reason

But remember take your time

Nothing stops for those

Who can't afford to wait

The best advice that I can give you

Is to hold on to your head

And as long as you are good and kind

You'll always be a friend of mine



You'll always be a friend of mine

As long as you are good and kind

You'll always be a friend of mine

You'll always be a friend of mine",A Friend of Mine

Apart from arms to hug and hold you tight
I'll have the love that I've been saving for you

Any old time that you can't get started
Nothing you do is going right

How much does it cost

Is it really any good

How would you react
Would you simply smile and say
Don't be silly go away
Anyone can plainly see

It couldn't happen here
Not in a million years
Everyone knows one and one is two
And all take for granted that it's true

Everybody know that the world is round
Although it doesn't look it from the ground
Everybody knows it's right
But what if one and one were five

And the world not really round
Everywhere was just a huge flat piece of ground
Look at all the animals
Living in zoos

Elephants and tigers
lions and kangaroos
Don't they all look cute
When they're hid behind a cage

Funny when they laugh
Exciting when then rage
But what if they took control
There and then reversed the role

What would your impression be
How would you react
Would you simply smile and say
don't be silly go away

It couldn't happen here

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I'm afraid that from today our meeting
Must be temporarily postponed
It seems our parents followed us one evening
Caught us walking one another home
Now I have been confined till further notice
Told I should be thoroughly ashamed
And for all the good that it will do me
They've only themselves to blame

I don't understand a word they're saying
Telling me it's for our own good
Do they think that we're just children playing
How can we be so misunderstood

I am a man the same as any other
Younger though I may be in my years
Tell me I'm a child who should know better
And you won't see me holding back the tears

And if the day you thought
Was drawing to a close
Just drags on and on till when

And the car you bought this morning doesn't go

Much to your pleasure
That you haven't got a care
All the worries you had in you
Are no longer there

I wonder would you mind

Oh, would you mind removing it

And I'm not one to fuss
But if I don't catch my bus

That if you have one more drink
We're all liable to sink

They almost look alive
It's amazing after all these years
How they've survived

Two young children gazing at them
Faces so forlorn
One is saying to the other
I wonder how they're born

It's funny how we always tend
To look back on our past
As if they were the only good times
That we're ever going to have

See the river heading outwards
Watch the ships sail in
Notice how despite their size
They very rarely sink

Tell the man who's watching with you
His shoelace is undone
When he looks pretend you didn't notice
You were wrong

And anytime there's trouble up ahead
Don't get into a state
Where you wish you were dead
Just take your time and do

What you believe is right
It could turn out to be
A blessing in disguise-disguise-

To overlook the bad

Talk about doing what you do best

Seems to me the more you do
The less you get
All told I would say that it was pretty grim

I say to you likewise I feel just the same

When two people get that close
That their feelings to each other

Won't change
I'll kiss you and then I'll kiss you once again

Or perhaps a good kick up the rear
But one thing's for sure
I'll have to endure
A great deal of pain so to speak

I know it's not right
But for a laugh every night
I knock on people's doors
And shout things like up yours

I'll never know why

I had so many things I wanted to say
Yet when knocked your mother answered the door

Why? I asked her politely
You're not her type, she said, you're too carefree
So take your bunch of wild petunias and go
We don't want you here no more

Now why does it always have to be me
Who gets picked upon just like three
Daisies in a jam jar looking bored
Or three Spanish bullfighters

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I remember once as a boy of nine
My sister eating glass
Though she thought it strange
For a glucose fruit
She enjoyed the taste it had
Having lived with you over seven years
It's amazing looking back
At the time our parents were of the view
Outside marriage it would never last
Now my parents they were
Divorced last year
And yours are separating soon
If they'd spent less time picking holes in us
Maybe they might not have been doomed
I remember once, as a child at school
My teacher calling me
And it, wasn't `Raymond, step forward please`
It was `O'Sullivan, come here'
Now at school they teach you to be polite
But as far as I am concerned
If the ones who teach you
Don't know themselves
How on earth are we supposed to learn
You might remember, just a few years back
Man's first footprints on the moon
Who'd have thought that after
Such a giant step
It would mean so little so soon
Mean so little so soon
If you go outside for a breath or air
And you start by breathing in
When you feel it's done you a power of good
It could have done more damage than you'd think
For the air we breath may be all that's ours
But you mustn't be fooled by space
At the rate we're going we'll all be dead
Breathing in our very own waste
Its amazing really, let me explain
But the thought of ending up dust
Is a clear reminder to those who feel
They're superior to us, superior to us",I Remember Once

The morning after you arrived

Instead of wishing you'd leave
I got down on my knees
Begged and pleaded with you
Not to get dressed
It's no secret that I love you
But what good is our affair
If I can't have you all to myself
She says while you're having fun
You are not the only one

Into detail she won't go

We are victims of a crime
We otherwise loathe
And for as long as we live
Till we die
There's no telling why
There's no telling why

Oh, pretty baby
You've got me on a limb
And you know you drive me crazy
For you I'd do most anything
Having stolen you from someone
Who loves you no less than I
It's amazing how love takes control
And there's no telling why",No Telling Why
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"You seem to be wanting
Everything yesterday
Always the impossible
That's what you seem to portray
Give me one good reason
Why, even if I stay
You won't walk away from me
Tomorrow today

You seem to be wanting
Everything yesterday
Why, all of a sudden
Are you acting in this way

Leave me as you found me
Astound me no more
Who cares what today's like
The morning before

Did you ever stop to ask him
Where he's going
Has it not occurred to you
Without you knowing
You're reducing me to no more
Than a wreck
I cannot stand the pace you're keeping
What's you're meaning",Tomorrow Today
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Now move a little closer baby
Don't stand in the road
There's such a lot of traffic about
You'll catch your death of cold
And as you can well imagine
What with your death on my hands
Nobody would believe me
They just wouldn't understand
Without you knowing
You got me going
Without your knowing
You got me going... (You got me going)
You got me going (You got me going)
All the way

Now waiting for the bus to come
Is getting to be a drag
Time was when it used to get here
Dead on quarter past
Now its almost quarter to
And still it hasn't shown
By the time I get to your place
I might just as well have flown
Without you knowing
You got me going
Without your knowing
You got me going (You got me going)
You got me going (You got me going)
All the way

And I don't ever want you to think
That I'm the sort
Who has a woman waiting for me
In every port
I mean, as far as I know
I've never been to sea
Unless you count the time I went out
In it up to my knees

And I don't ever want you to think
That for a start
I would ever do anything
To break your heart
You see, the bond we have between us
Is enough
To ensure when we're together
We are miles away in love

Now I'm not superstitious
But if ever I see a cat
The first thing that I do
Is check and see it isn't black
And if on close inspection
It turns out to be maroon
I'll breathe a heavy sigh of relief
And grab you on my broom
Without you knowing
You got me going
Without your knowing
You got me going (You got me going)
You got me going (You got me going)
All the way",You Got Me Going
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Look at me, I'm in my glory
Like a child, who loves a story
Pinching myself just to see
If you're really here with me
Nothing good can last for long
So when you feel like moving on
Break it to me gently
How I wish that we could make
Love for as long as it can take
Wear each other out, and then
Stop and start it all again
All my life I dreamed of this
And if a dream is all this is
Break it to me gently

And, I don't want to sound a bore
What will be will be I know
But there's no harm in asking
For when you have a beauty rare
Why can it not be everlasting

Is it true what I hear whispered
You get tired of men so quick
That it's now become a standing joke
How long will the next one cope
If there isn't the doubt
And I'm the next to be kicked out
Break it to me gently

And, I don't want to sound a bore
What will be will be I know
But there's no harm in asking
You've been through all this before
Could this one not be ever-lasting

Optimistic though I am
Things will remain the way they stand
Nevertheless there is this fear
You might one day disappear
I just hope that if it's true
You will have the decency to
Break it to me gently
If and when the time arrives
Don't just leave me high and dry
Break it to me gently",Break It to Me Gently
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"There's nothing in the world that I'd like more
Than to be left standing outside your door
Where perhaps I might be, asked to come in
There I could very easily demonstrate
What now appears to be my fate
You see I'm hooked on something
And it's not heroin

Oh, I just can't get enough of you
No I can't get enough, what am, I gonna do
I've tried every trick in the book that's going
Now I've decided that they're not worth knowing
My predicament is as simple as this
I'm not satisfied and the reason is
I just can't get enough of you
My experience of life so far

Has been to say the least not the least bizarre
I mean I work for a living, 8 hours a day
I don't smoke or drink except for a little wine
The friends that I have are the genuine kind
I think I'm fairly rational in a moderate way
Yet I can't get enough of you
No I can't get enough, what am I gonna do
I've had other woman but they don't move me
You're the only one that can see right through me
What you've got I can't explain
Other than to tell you I have one complaint

I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you

No I can't get enough, what am I gonna do
Like Oliver Twist, said when he asked for more
I happen to like what you gave me before
My condition is rather unique
I'm suffering from the world's first lovely disease
I just can't get enough of you",Can't Get Enough of You
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I feel so strange here on my own
She's out with her friends
While me I don't have one
Every time I have some
She would make them all disperse
Yet I love her with all of my hear
T For what it's worth
She said had I been more careful with her
We wouldn't have had to get married quite so quick
And she never wanted kids
Hates the thought of giving birth
Yet I worship the ground she walks upon
For what it's worth
I don't know what I can say
Perhaps it's just a passing phase
Nothing worse than being in love
With one who isn't
If I've hurt her I'll admit
I'll apologize for ITV 
Even if what she says I did, I didn't
I give her the bulk of my weekly pay
She takes it without even thanking me one bit
And I've worked hard for it
So a thank you wouldn't hurt
Yet I love her with all of my heart
For what it's worth
I don't ask for very much
I'm not one to make a fuss
In fact the less said is for me
So much the better
Maybe I should be more strong
Tell her straight look.' what's going on
But if I do that, she might leave me altogether
Oh, I've been high up and I've been low
But lately the latter is so far out ahead
I wish I were dead
She treats me like I was dirt
Yet I love her with all my heart
For what it's worth",For What It's Worth
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"So you want to love me
But you don't know why
You've got a problem up ahead
That's in sight
Love to meet your uncle
Only as I was saying
I have a relative myself the same type

Call yourself a man
I said, why not if it's true
I said, you call yourself a taxi and fly
And like a bird she flew out of the window
Leaving me a box of milk tray
A note upon it to say
If nothing's alright it's okay
'Cause help is on the way

Sorry to disturb you
At this awful hour
But I was wondering
If you have the time

Supposed to meet a woman here
At half past eight
And now you're telling me
It's already nine
Man you should have seen it
As the boat overturned
There was a cry out
From a hand or a leg
And like a stone she went
Down to the bottom
Leaving us above in dismay
Despite the captain who'd say
If nothing's alright it's okay
'Cause help is on the way

I got a letter
It came as a note
It said, I'm sorry
I haven't spoke
It was written out in Braille
So I knew that it felt good
Right from the start, solo part 

I tried to reach you
But you weren't at home
I left a message
Right after the tone It said, sorry I'm not in
If you'd care to call again
I'll get back to you, back to you
So you want to love me
But you don't know why
You've got a bee up in your bonnet

That's fine
Nothing like a buzz going around
Your head
To clear the cobwebs from the state
Of your mind
Well, you won't believe this
But believe me

It's true
I had this woman
In the palm of my hand
When like a madman
She leap out the window Leaving me a box of milk tray
A note upon it to say,
If nothing's alright it's okay
'Cause help is on the way.",Help Is on the Way
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Since I've known you we've always been together
And in that time the love we shared we vowed would last forever
Yet marriage is a subject you approve
Providing it has nothing whatsoever to do with you
And much as I respect that view

Have to state my case
Though I'm far from being over-the-hill
It occurs to me with each passing day
That I'm not getting any younger
God knows it wasn't my idea
The years that used to take
An eternity to make

Are now passing at what seems like one a week
If only we'd have met when I was your age
Wouldn't have this awful fear I get when I leave your place
You don't know how upsetting it can be
To hear you talk of future plans
None of which seem to include me
Blue jeans and high heel boots are great
'Course I still wear mine quite a bit
But it's now more apparent than ever before
Despite keeping myself fairly fit
That I'm not getting any younger

Even those gray hairs are now starting to appear
And there are lines under my eyes
That never used to be this size
Even though it could be due to lack of sleep
Something tells me that it's more to do with passing years
At times I think perhaps it would be better
If rather than go on this way

Posted you a letter
Explaining in great detail why I feel
The way things are between us
Suits you much more than it suits me
You have you whole life ahead of you
Well damn it I also have mine

And unless I am by nature a freak
There's no mistaking those deadly signs
And I'm not getting any younger
Look closely now and you will see
The rebel in his teens
Who thought all adults were obscene
Is now somewhat disenchanted with the news
That kids today have got no respect for his views

And I'm not getting any younger
Gone are those days when school reports were all I feared
Now for the first time in my life
I'm seeing something I don't like
And am powerless to prevent from happening
One day you'll find out for yourself just what I mean",I'm Not Getting Any Younger
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Oh, it's the niceness of it all,
Baby, it's the niceness of it all,
Whether you are close to me or far,
It doesn't matter in the least,
As long as I can be with you,
Any time I need to, like a baby,
That's just starting to grow,

It's the niceness of it all that,
Makes me love you more and more
And it's the niceness of it all,
Baby, it's the niceness of it all,
That makes me write to you and say
How much I've missed you over the weeks,
That makes me call you on the phone
Whenever there's a chance to speak
And even if there's only time to say hello,
It's the niceness of it all
That makes me love you more and more

I don't know what's come over me
I've hardly touched a drink,
My mother thinks it's marvelous,
He's off the road to sin,
She thinks you're just the tonic,
That I need,
And who am I to argue,

After all, isn't that what I believe
It's the niceness of It all,
Baby, it's the niceness of it all,
If I can't be with you for a week,
Then a day will have to do,
I won't say that that's enough,
But then beggars can't be choosers,
And besides if nothing else at least I know,
It's the niceness of it all,
That makes me love you more and more

Every time I see a shadow,
I think what a blessing it must be,
Not to have to talk with fingers,
Not to have look with nothing to see
You try living your life to the full,
Confined to a chair,

Try and hide your loneliness when no one is there
Yes it's the niceness of it all,
That makes me love you more and more,
It's the niceness of it all babe,
That's what I like, and what I need,
The niceness of it all, it's the niceness of it all,

Whether close to me or far,
It's no matter where you are,
For as far as I can see,
You're the only one for me
It's the niceness of it all,
It's what I like, what I need,
It's the niceness, just the niceness of it all.

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I've never been able
To stand on a table
Without using both of my feet
I've always resisted
The choice that was listed

Whenever I sat down to eat
Now don't think me rude 
But that dress is so low cut
Your navel is sticking out
And not that I'm curious
But seeing how low yours is
I wonder where mine is about

I read in the newspapers only today
That tomorrow's will be even better
Liquid detergent is now guaranteed
To absorb all the dirt from your sweater 
Or so they say
We once had a neighbor
Who came from Jamaica
(No, she came of her own accord)

Who talked with an accent
Like that of a Dachshund
Whose cousin the Queen had adored
Oh how would you like it
If I was invited
To Lords on the first day of play
I'm no Gary Sobers
But I can bowl overs
In quite an unorthodox way

Now cricket's a game that can baffle us all
It's the silly mid-on that gets me
Silly or not, it's enthralling to watch
Only maidens of course disagree
Or so they say

Life is so often a dullish affair
It's no wonder that crime has increased
What does it matter, if there's no hereafter
We're here after all just to breathe

I'm a coward I have to confess
But at least I'm honest

I'll never forget how it was that we met
You were just seventeen
I told you I liked older women
And you were the oldest I'd seen
You started to laugh
Told me I must be daft
Whereupon I said yes
But at least I'm honest

And I'll go on sending you birthday cards

And I'll try my hardest not to forget

I'm scared of heights you see

One thing I like about you is you're
never embarrassed at all

I won't get undressed

I'll give you a lift on my bicycle
if you don't mind going slow
Needless to say it can vary
Depending on how the wind blows

I couldn't afford the test

For something I might have done

Is it unwise you'll have to tell me
Because as far as I can see
If it's unwise all I can say is
God help you and me
Patience Is a timely virtue
Helps us overcome delay

Waiting up all hours won't hurt you
But it will done with skill
Kill you anyway
Is it a crime to say how are you
A crime to say how well
Is it a crime to beg forgiveness
After putting you through hell

Is it a crime you wouldn't think so
But from the looks that I've received
Not only should I not have said it
But I Shouldn't even speak
Memories alone won't take up
As much time as we'd like them too
Strangely enough. the more we break-up

The less I find peace of mind
Living without you
Is It a crime to say I love you
A crime to say I care
Is It a crime to want you madly (gladly)

Without you even there
Is It a crime to be remembered
By someone close to you
If it's a crime all I can say is
What is the world coming to",Is It a Crime

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I'm looking for a man who knows how to finish
Better than to begin
I'm looking for a girl whose age is Virginia
Name around seventeen
I'm looking for a tie that won't get knotted
One that will not be four making five
On I've a reason you see
That's good. tell me where's the door

I like to think it's time I stopped interfering
In peoples private lives
I like to think the bits I find fascinating
Ought to decrease in size
I like to think but then you tell me who doesn't
And I'll tell you a tale/tail
Is the part you start with when you begin
Or brush If your dog's on sale

I like to think but then you tell me who doesn't
And I'll tell you a sale
Is the time you find out everything's cheap
Only prices remain unchanged
I'm wondering If the girl I married this morning
Wants us to get divorced

I'm wondering If the child we both plan on having
Shouldn't be ordered first
I'm wondering If the pain I have In my left leg
Isn't just In my head
Which Is fine don't mind as long as I'm here
I might as well stay myself",Looking
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I've got a good position here. my boss is proud of me
He said so in a letter that he wrote the other week
My parents too are happy. which is nice
For without their encouragement I never would have tried
But now much to their horror. I've decided I might quit
What's the point of working hard when I can hardly live
The key to my survival lies with you
Don't ask me what you've got. I only know that while you do
For a minute of your time, a minute of your time
I would gladly go with you anywhere
For a minute of your time. a minute of your time
I'd be happy in despair

It's funny how our lives are mapped out in a certain way
Call it fatalistic if you want to that's okay
The point I'm trying to make. is. as a rule
An error on your part can be a costly one for you
But looking back how often have you thought. well I'll be blowed
If it wasn't for that error. I'd be on a different road
Which leads me very nicely round to you
You know how much I love you and until you love me too

For a minute of your time a minute of your time
I would gladly go with you anywhere
For a minute of your time. a minute of your time
I'd be happy in despair
For a minute of your time. a minute of your time
Even though it may not seem that long to you
For a minute of your time. a minute of your time
Even less for me would do

I don't suppose you'd ever think of moving in with me
Lots of people do it. it's quite common I believe
This may come as a shock. even to you
But I'm the one who feels this way and here's what I would do
For a minute of your time. etc.",Minute of Your Time
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Some say the right words, some say it's absurd
To think that children can brutally die
I say it's easy, so very easy
And all we do is wonder why

In spite of progress. you say we're making
In spite of wisdom. stretching afar
We find solutions, always solutions
But none to mend a broken heart

Can't be in two places at one time
I can't even stretch my legs
Without someone pointing a finger at me
Saying you'd better stop or else

You are the kingdom. you are the glory
No doubt without you I just couldn't survive
And yet It happens, oh when It happens
What do we do. we wonder why

Can't be In two places at one time
I can't even stretch my legs
Without someone pointing a finger at me

To think that children. without food can die
I say It's easy. so very easy
And all we do is wonder why",Wonder Why
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"You may have given me the breaks
Amended all my life's mistakes
Ooh but pretty baby
You don't own me

You may be more than just a friend
On whose assistance I depend
Ooh but pretty baby
You don't own me

What makes you think you have the right
To say that I owe you my life
A life you say is your life only
Nothing to do with me
Well don't forget for all your power
Even in my darkest hour
You don't own me

You may be fully in control of
Every dream I'll ever hold
Ooh but pretty baby
You don't own me

You might have taught me how to dress
Whereas before I looked a mess
Ooh but pretty baby
You don't own me

I know it sounds so very cruel
To have to say I don't want you
After all the love you've shown me
Let's not start a feud
I'm not your slave don't you forget it
And even if I live to regret it
You don't own me

Why must you always be so right
Why can't you never be wrong
It's not a crime to say you're sorry
And it don't take long
If it only takes a minute to say something that's nice
If it only takes a minute then why not twice

It might interest you to know
If I'm unhappy then I'll go
No point in staying here being lonely
What good would that do
It's time you got it through your head
Although I'm grateful for all your help
You don't own me",You Don't Own Me
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Now I'm not, I repeat not anyway a prude
But the sight of two people cavorting on stage
Doing what can only be termed a natural act
Is unless you wear a raincoat only good for a laugh

As a rule, I never smoke while on duty
It just isn't on do I make myself clear
Though at times if there nobody's looking I will
I mean, life's too short and if I didn't smoke I bet
What with the luck that I have
I'd probably die of warty and, that would be that

Who would have thought it was humanly possible
To mate an elephant with a kangaroo
Well as my dear old mother once said in a rage
""next thing you know they'll have pigs an the stage""

Whoever said blue skies were better than red
Must have been talking from out of his hat
I mean whose ever heard of a blue sky at night
Don't like waiting or suffocating
In over crowded tubes
But I like good wine with my dinner don't you
Yes we do",As a Rule

In the merry month of September
I took a trip to see
All the things I was going to be
A famous movie star
With a two hundred foot car

That will only carry two people
Came to see me yesterday
In the merry month of July 
I'll fly anywhere you want me to
Just tell me when and

You won't mind if I don't find
What I am looking for
What I am looking for
Is a bicycle made for one

Plus a carriage made for two people

Been through all kinds of hell
Trouble was not only my middle name
It was my first as well

Through the years all I've encountered
I've lust one thing to say
Hold on to what you got
And don't let it slip away

I've been taken for far more rides
To places I've never been,
Stabbed so many times in the back
I so longer feel a thing

Ask me what all this has taught me
And I'll tell you what I'll say
Hold on ...
Save it for a rainy day

And keep a watchful eye on anyone that tells you lies
See that it's true
You get what your entitled to
I was brought up same as you were

No different and no worse
You could be sure my mother would hit me
If I tampered with her purse
All my life has been a lesson

I have not a penny in my pocket and if soon
I should be found just as badly broken
I won't gloom
'cause it ain't me
As I've got myself which matters most
Throughout the life I lead
I have wandered into many a town
And have often been tempted to settle down
Yet if I did I'm sure I'd find
I'd always change my mind
So I'll keep right ahead with what I'm doing
Although I have no luxuries
My mind is quite at ease
It may seem medieval yet it's all that my heart pleads
And it ain't for me

What I am doing, although I have planned
Out everything yesterday morning
I saw you walk by My front door is blue

How about you
Coming around to see me in the spring
Mattress on my bed, there's one sheet missing
Since last July, I don't know why

I let you walk right pass.
My front door is green. Have you seen
Anybody with a name
Should know how to spell

It unless he is insane
And I'm very well

Inclined to look away
I don't know why, but some day
I will turn my head and say

Excuse me miss, but this glove is
It the one that you've just dropped
And you'll reply by saying ""of course""
Or in as many words ""get lost""

I've never been successful
I mean with girls of my own age
They like the food and the wines I choose
But after that I'm afraid

That in the art of making love
I'm really so naive it's not true
I usually pretend I'm too tired
And then fall asleep as proof

And by the sound of things
It looks as though I'm doomed
To spend the rest of my life living in one room
Dreaming of how one cold and windy night quite cooly

Sophia Loren seduced me

I drive a Ford Cortina estate

I'll show you my license plate",Shy

'Cause that's where I come from
Now if you don't and I know you won't

In Midsummer night's dreams
Where if he will permit you to

You'll see how it begun
But please don't say that that's okay
'Cause that's where I come from
And... if you ask me why we multiply

I'll tell you when divided
Two from two leaves
But please don't say that that's okay
'Cause that's where I come from

And if some day she should want to stay
On our mum's kitchen floor
Providing he's not under age
I see no reason for

Me to go out without a doubt, as he'll be moving on

To supply me and rewind me every time that I go down

It reminds me of a place I used to go
With you when I was a boy of seventeen
At least I think it was, if not somewhere between
That amount of fun I've not got
A lot of time to spare
Everywhere there's people staring
They think I am wearing funny clothes
Who knows, where I can go
For a meal there's a real restaurant in town

I would somehow be released
All problems too would cease
My heart would never feel no pain

At the very moment you arrive
I stop living and I start to feel alive
You have the power that's taken over me
Led me to believe
Call it what you like

I suspect that I will pinch myself to find
That it really isn't true
It really can't be you

Here's a thousand more
Will you still be mine forever and evermore

No te amargues ten la seguridad
de que tambien ella se arrepentira'

Well in that case
Why won't she answer the phone? 
Don't try and tell me
She's not at home

We're sorry but what can I say
I love her so much I can't think
What are we doing? What have we done?
What in the world is going on?
Isn't it crazy looking so fine

As it takes to make a drink
We could all become as the dinosaur has
Nothing but extinct

This one especially
When I'm alone with you it seems all my dreams
come true
It makes me feel so good I just can't help loving you
'Cause your everything I could hope for
That's why I love you
Sometimes I tell myself this girl don't love you no-more
And that someday with someone new she'll walk from your door
But if you did my world would break in two
That's why I love you
And anytime I see your face
Something very unusual takes place
All my inhibitions disappear
Now that you are here",That's Why I Love You

No matter what you say
Looks like I'm here to stay

No matter where I go
I don't know if you know
But everywhere we been
I'm kept in quarantine

It's easy to see why
She's over six feet five
I'm only five foot two
Is there a Tyre somewhere
That might take me a spare
Is there a bank in town
That might cash me a pound

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I want to tell you,
I might as well do
About a girl I met back in May
Her name is Rita
And you should see her
When she goes
Ooh wakka doo wakka day

She's got a brother
like any other
Who got his nose caught
Inside a gate
And when they freed him
It so relieved him
He just went
Ooh wakka doo wakka day

You wouldn't think to look at me
That I was strong but underneath
It all I really am
And just prove it why only the other
Day I picked a needle up with one hand

Now up in Bradford
A chap named Radford
While taking part in a local play
Was intercepted and then suspected
of going Ooh wakka doo wakka day

ay ay ay
Who's that lady I saw you with? 
It was not your wife
It looked to me suspiciously like
Some I'd had never seen before 
In my life
Do, do, do 

It's not surprising when
You come to think of it
Just what it is that makes 
people swear
You only have to sing the wrong bleepin' thing
And there'll be bleeping every bleeping where. 

Now if you love me
You're not above me
And if you don't well
What can I say
Except will see then
You come to tea then
you can go
Ooh wakka doo wakka day",Ooh-Wakka-Doo-Wakka-Day
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I don't know if you've heard the news but I'm a boy
Who's got himself a problem so big it's no joy
You see I've something that people claim
Could bring me fortune and instant fame
A face so ugly you could hardly blame 
Anybody here for saying so

I think I'll bury myself deep beneath the ground
And come up only when there's no one else around
And if by chance someone approaches me
And that someone happens to be a she
You can bet your life in time of worry
I wouldn't hesitate but to be that way

Oh why can't girls just look at me and smile
Instead of looking at me as though 
I will turn my head and before I go to bed 
Gaily underneath the blanket go

I've even wrote to Marjorie Proops, but she can't help
The best that she could offer me was disguise yourself
Well this I've done would you believe not twice
But more than once in fact I think it was nice
So much so when I'm inclined to hurry
I wouldn't hesitate but to be that way-oh oh oh

Whoa! Whoa!",Underneath the Blanket Go

I don't know if you don't know me,

You might do but then again you might not, you might not,
And I've seen so many peculiar incidents in my life,
Like the time a fella got married to a fella,

He called his wife,
Did they make a handsome couple,
Well how are we to know,
What happens when they want a child,
Isn't that what keeps a marriage alive?

Funny things in my life,
Like the time a woman said sorry to a man,
She stabbed with a knife

And in view of all of this nonsense,
I think it's only fair,
To point out that despite its faults,
England still has HP sauce,

I just can't get you out of my mind,
Don't be like that baby, be like you are,
Don't wear that hat baby, it looks like a scarf,

Don't make me have to go,
Don't leave me in a spin,
Make me your everything, everything, everything,

And I'd do my best to make you happy also,
For we'd make each other happy, too,

Don't make me have to go,
Don't leave me in a spin,

Where there's a match on, what can I say,

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"[Chorus: x2]
Sometimes I think I don't know what I'm doing,
But I always end up doing what I know,

And It's amazing when you think of it,
How many people smoke,
Despite the risks that are involved,
There's really very little hope,
Without them we just couldn't cope,
Couldn't cope, neither could we
Sometimes I think I don't know what I'm doing,
But I always end up doing what I know,
Doing what I know, doing what I know

Have you ever wondered,
What would happen in a third world war,
No sooner would it have begun,
Than it would be all over,
Just look over your shoulder, your shoulder,
It's above your knees

[Chorus]

And what I know, may not I know be a great deal
But what I know nobody can take,
Nobody can take, nobody can take away from me,
No, no, no, away from me, no, no, no
I do what I know, doing what I know

Away we go doing what I know",Doing What I Know
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I woke up late this morning
That's the second lime this week
If my boss finds out I'm late again
He's sure to make me leave

Is there no end to my worries
I'm forever wondering
My girlfriend's name is Susan
We got engaged last march

Was killed while getting off a bus
At the top of marble arch
What did she do to deserve this
I'm forever wondering

Let me say that right away
Whatever you might think
I am not about to lose my mind
Although I might feel that way inclined

I'm not the type, no head for heights
You think you got your troubles
Well just take a look at mine
Must be the first pedestrian

To receive a parking fine
Is there no-end to my worries
I'm forever wondering
How can you sit there and say things like

Boy you're looking good
When I feel like something the cat brought in
Not that I don't like cats why think
Yours would look great on a curry plate

I've got this slight infection
Thought was in my head
When I asked my doctor what it was
He said "" I don't know myself""

I'm forever wondering",Forever Wondering
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"You gave your love so tenderly,
Said there could be no one hut for me,
And all the time you had it planned,
To spend your weekend with another man,

What kind of love do you call this,
I cannot live my life on promises,
You say your lesson has been learned,
It's over now as far as you're concerned

Well I'll believe it when I see it,
I'll believe it when I see it
If I can't have you when I want to,
I might just as well be dead,

I don't think I can live my life
Sharing you with someone else,
You told our children on the phone,
How much you hated leaving them alone,

Yet for the past few weeks or so
You never phoned them just to say hello;
You disappointed me so much,
Does it surprise you that I bear a grudge,

In Spite of promises you broke,
You still insist that there 5 a ray of hope
Well I'll believe it when I see it,
I'll believe it when I see it

If we can't survive and live our lives
The way we both intended to,
We might just as well stop right now,
What good would going on do

I'll believe it when I see it,
Oh, you know I try to understand,
I'll believe it when I see it,

But then who needs biggies when with a pair like Twiggy's
I love you just as you are

When you do go away, even for a day
I would like it to be known
That I wish that you could stay
Now the day we got married

Over the threshold of Mooney's bar

Where in between every round
You fell flat out on the ground

Who I hear have settled have down after two years in the nick

Once and for all, who knows baby,
Next year a stork might call,

Present us with a beautiful sight to see,

All my life I never asked for very much,
Never felt the need to take what I could touch,

My ambition was without any fuss,
To be happy, happy, happy, happy
Well judging by the time I'm having with you,
I'd say it's come true, now why don't we

Get together once and for all,
Who knows baby next year a stork might call,
Present us with a beautiful sight to see,
Our own baby;

We'll give it everything that money cannot buy,
We'll take it with us everywhere we go,
Because we love it

You can be as wrong as you are right,

But as the doctor observed
What could she do with it
Then when she said we must part
Albeit for only an hour
Couldn't go through with it

I was unhappy until she came along
Suddenly problems
That seems insurmountable
Left in a huff

What would you do if like me
You had the girl of your dreams
Only you blew it
How do you think you would feel
Looking back and saying to yourself
That was so stupid

I don't know what makes
The perfect romance
Could be as simple as tickling her toes
When you're both in the tub
You'll never lose
Not when you choose
Taking a chance on love

When will you find it
Will it be true
What is the answer
I wish that I knew
Somebody's partner
Whose wife is a friend
Illustrates just what I mean

I was so set in my ways
Had someone followed me home
They couldn't beat me there
Never believed in the phrase
That you haven't lived till you've love
Oh, I didn't seem to care

Call me old fashioned but I still aspire

In a church full of people
A priest up above

I'm sure you must be very proud of them

On second thoughts I think I'd better leave
This talk of children is upsetting me

And I can't for the life of me fathom
Out why Eve when she met up with Adam
Didn't know they would put at risk
Every man, woman, child
For the bite of an apple

Remember days of wine and daffodils
A hand upon your breast oh what a thrill
It's so sad
You were the best love I never had

You make your bed
And then you lie in it
Wouldn't the truth be more appropriate

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying, ""My god, that's tough
She's stood him up""
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to well wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about god and his mercy
Or if he really does exist
Why did he desert me in my hour of need
I truly am indeed alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? what do we do?

Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, god rest her soul,
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

I cried and cried all day

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Always when you think about it, nothing goes
Quite the way you wish it would do
Even when you think that you have got it made
Someone else has gone and made it too
Usually the first thing you do each day
Isn't different to the last
Even if the same things are happening here
That have happened in the past
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Or which way it's gonna go
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
But you can be there after the day before
Never mind the weather if the sun don't shine
Well and good and good if it's clear
Seems to me we'd all be at a loss for words
If the weather was to disappear
Losing isn't always a pretty sight
Especially when you go for gold
Still it's only one jump in your life
And with many more to unfold
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Or which way it's gonna go
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Just like in Norway
There's Nor-way you could know
I wonder what would happen
If all the hills were flattened
And somebody requested a push
How would they go about it
Without a hill I doubt it
A push however hard is enough
Even if a push came to shove
Making all the right moves in excess
Doesn't mean your race is won
Even if your right shoe is on your left
Even if your left's undone
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Or which way it's gonna go
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
But you can be there
After the day before
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Or which way it's gonna go
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Droom summer hide fall dawn
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Could be I don't know
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Will it be sunshine, showers
A basket of flowers
There's no way you could know
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring
Or which way it's gonna go
There ain't no telling what tomorrow will bring",Ain't No Telling (What Tomorrow Will Bring)
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"When you're feeling blue
You don't know what to do
Just call on me
I'll make it worth your while
I'll always be at home
You'll never be alone
As long as I'm there with you
By your side
Now when the moon is high
Above there in the sky
Just knock upon my door
And I'll be with you
No matter where you go
Just come and let me know
I hold your hand
And when alone I'll kiss you
With you I feel happy
When I know that I'll never change my mind
With me you can be
Any hour (any hour), day or night (day or night)
Call on me girl, (call on me)
Anytime you like, like
So if you feel today
You'd rather get away
To some place where you know
You won't be lonely
Just call on me and see
How happy you will be
I'll make you feel
You life's just for me only
With you I feel happy

It's goodbye
I'll now hand you over to the A-side
I hope you enjoyed my little be

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I was asking for a drink last night
Never noticing that things just weren't quite right
For the bartender said you look queer
So disappear
Before I realized what I'd be through
A girl came up to me and said ""I love you""
But I whispered gently in her ear
To disappear
What is wrong with everyone in this town
That's what I am asking me
And to my reply it's bound to be
Something I'll never forget
That alone it would happen again
But if it did, I'd know right there and then
I would pack everything I have here
And disappear",Disappear
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"My doctor told me if my headache gets much worse
The best thing that I can do is get myself a nurse
Let her give me the kiss of life and after that
You watch my headache disappear three seconds flat
And as you know, I don't really want you to go
For I would much rather you stay with me
Be on hand when I need good company
, The other morning I forget now where I'd been
Some fella cornered me said ""hey man what's your scene?""
I told him frankly that I wasn't in a play
That if I was I wouldn't give my scene away
And as you know I don't really want you to go
For I would much rather you stay with me
Be on hand when I need good company
Altogether everybody turn and touch your toes
When I stop to give the signal
That's when I would like you
That's when I would like you
To go oh...oh
Muhammad Ali better known as Cassius Clay
Boy what a boxer he was and still is today
I had a go myself once thought that I was him
But unlike Muhammad baby I could never win
And as you know I don't really want you to go
For I would much rather you stay with me
Be on hand when I need
Much rather you stay with me
Be on hand when I need good company",Good Company
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I think love is just a load of crap
But having said that
If you'd love me the way that I love you
I'd take it all back
I don't give a dam about you now
And I'm not being sour
There's plenty more of you where I come from
On the hour
Every hour
And I don't suppose you'd consider
Accompanying me out to dinner
Found this really cute little French place
The food they tell me is Greek
I'll understand please forgive me
What's his name is it Dave
Does he take you everywhere
I'll bet
He's lousy in bed
Not like me
Oh I think women are completely daft
But having said that
How many of them do you ever hear
Get a heart attack
And having said that 
Don't come running after me again
I'm not your friend
Liked you once about a week ago
But that was then
Never again
Of all the women I've loved
You're the first to make blood boil
All the others they would of course
Make it bleed
I don't know how to thank you enough
Can't stand the sight of blood
You see
You mean nothing to me anymore
So now you know
I had been thinking that for quite some time
I'd let you go
So now you know
And don't think that I don't men this
Whatever we had between us
Is to the best of my knowledge
Now a thing of the past
But then again if you came up
With nothing on but your make-up
Possibilities are
Out if the kindness of my heart
I might
For tonight
Let you in",Having Said That
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"I love it but it doesn't knock me out
I think it's great, but it could be better
I like it a lot, it's just not my cup of tea
Yet if you were to change the melody
Take out a part that you think should be here
Put in a part that wouldn't otherwise appear
Well it's only an idea.
I hate it but that doesn't mean it's bad
In other words I quite enjoyed it
Apart from which, it's the best you've ever done
Yet if you were to change the words
It would be superb with perhaps a different melody
I love it but it's just a shade too long
Though to be fair you'd hardly notice
The only thing as I say is how it's done
Bits to me sound like it ought to have been sung
Not only in two part harmony but one
Making the whole thing really swing before it's swung
Walk instead of run
I love it, but it doesn't knock me out
Yet it you were to change the words
It would be superb with perhaps a different melody.
I love it but it doesn't knock me out
I think it's great, but it could be better
I like it a lot, it's just not my cup of tea
Yet if you were to change the melody
Take out a part that you think should be here
Replace it with a part that wouldn't otherwise appear

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"God speed on your journey overseas
Into the path of the sun
And while you're away spare a thought for me
Cause I'll be the lonely one
You say that my leaving doesn't mean
We've been together too long
What it does mean however is till
Your here
I'll be the lonely one
Come away with me won't you
I can hear A voice in the distance yell
And when I look up to see if it
Could be you
I see that it's only myself
I'll be the lonely one
Some say that it's easy to forget
The further it is that you run
What I'd like to say is when your not here
I'll be the lonely one
I'll be the lonely one
And I won't try and reach you
There's no point
You never return my call
If I do leave a message I guarantee
It won't be acknowledged at all

And while you're away

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Oh I'll may leave you for just a second
Just a second if that's ok
May last a little under an hour
All depends on how long I stay
Only when it's someone who's close
Does cancer hit you just like a bomb
Must be the only the disease on earth
Guaranteed to kill everyone
Watching and waiting
Mistaking the pun
For one that was never intended
Once they assure you it's all based on fact
You can be sure it's invented
I've got nothing but for tomorrow
No no don't get me wrong
What I mean
It's not I'll will be without my clothes
But there you want me well I'll be free
Wishing and hoping
And hoping and praying that it will soon stop raining
There's nothing worse than a cricketer's ball
Stuck in the mud complaining
Oh I may wake up to find you sleeping
Not in your bed but mine
I know it's only a dream
But what's wrong with that (ain't it)
Better than finding you on the floor (ain't it)
Better than finding you on the

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do
You do my name is Nosey
And this is me sister really (really)
Good she is at saying ""to you too""
Now just across the lawn is Pat
Sitting on his favorite hat
Waiting for the barber to arrive
And if he doesn't come today
Pat will shout (hip-hip-hooray)
Ain't it grand to be alive
When every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do
You do my name is Nosey
And this is me sister really (really)
Good she is at saying ""to you too""
Now lying on the garden fence
Is a man (at great expense)
History tells us will outgrow his youth
But only until such a time
He finds out why he's been lying
And then of course he'll tell the truth
'cause every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do - ya do
Now down among the partridge trees
Lives a man who loves his knees
So much so he's framed them in a jar
And if by chance one should escape
And to put on must in it's place
With half a pound of shredded tar
'cause every day's a holiday in Mr.Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon
And Bill and Ben found stardom

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Well here we are and here we go
Up the hill and down the slope
Pardon me if I seem out of breath
Bus was late so I walked instead There's nobody quite like me
Isn't that Presumably
What it is they say you're looking for
Ballad singer with a guitar
Okay so guitar was the part I got wrong
The rest of me surely is what you want
Wait a minute who is this
He needs a psychiatrist
Either that or I do give me strength
(Would do If I knew the way it went)
You say you sing slow songs and fast numbers too
Do you know volare
(Is that her next to you)
I'm running round in circles
I'm getting so forlorn
Whatever so forlorn's supposed to mean
I'm sick of good intentions
Whatever their intent on being
Who's responsibility lies in sending him to me
Tell me and I'll tear them limb from limb

No two ways about it
Or three or four or five

I know which one of those I'd rather heed
As I'm sure would the rabbit

I write each and all my songs
Always have done all along
So if you want ""My Way"" I can do
Every song in my way just for you
Has it occurred to you that I might not be well
I've got a heart that needs a bypass I can tell
So here we are together then
You and me the best of friends

How about employer then instead
We have to work closely and mostly we do
We're at opposite ends of

Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Oh I was born and raised in Alabam
Well it sounds better than Leeds
Mama said the sooner you grow up
The sooner you can leave
And thus I came into existence
What else can I tell you
I could reminisce about the kiss
That really blew my mind
I could demonstrate how when I was eight
I celebrated nine
I could be young I might be old
I could be and if so
So what
Got my finger on the trigger
Whatever that's supposed to mean
Got my thumb caught in between the door
After which I screamed
It only hurts now when I suck it
What else can I tell you
Well its very sad to think you had
More money than good sense
Now you've lost it all your back to call
On me you're oldest friend
I'm not a man who minces words 
And if that sounds absurd
So what
Even if it's likely to become the flavour of the year 
Demonstrating for the right to work is work that is sincere
There ain't no pride in being idle
What else can I tell you
Well I've been described as looking like a nothing of a man 
Had my work reviewed by critics who dismiss me out of hand
They say I'm middle of the road I say if that is so
So what",So What
Gilbert O'Sullivan,"Sometimes when I am lonely
And I need some love and care
Sometimes I feel I only
Have to call and you'll be there
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes
Sometimes I can look at you
Then I don't and then I do
Sometimes
Sometimes I take exception
To the way we're criticized
Once it was because we had long hair
And now cause we've short back and sides
They never stop they always have to win
Ooh a parents reputation is based
Only on what the neighbours think
Sometimes you have the answer
Long before the questions put
Sometimes you are a dancer
Without moving either foot
Sometimes I get undressed for dinner
Stay up all hours of the night
Have my breakfast with my lunch
Well you know it can be fun
Sometimes
Sometimes you take a letter
And you post it in a box
You assume that It will get there
Even though the last you sent got lost
How tragic it would be if here and now
Ooh all optimism disappeared
Replaced by something less endowed
Sometimes I'm up in heaven
When you hold me in your arms
Sometimes I'm up at seven
To the sound of my alarm
Sometimes I read about the third world
And the hunger there you find
Sometimes love it can be blue
Red or green and yellow too
Sometimes love is in the air
It's a crazy world I swear
