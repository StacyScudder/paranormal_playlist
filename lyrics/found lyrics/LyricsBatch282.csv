Louis Hayes,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Louis Hayes,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song is You
Louis Hayes,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Louis Hayes,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Louis Jordan,"Left Chicago in the summer, New York in the fall
Detroit in the winter didn't prove a thing at all
I got those roamin' blues, yes, I got those roamin' blues
Can't find no place to settle, woo, I got those roamin' blues

Joined a club in old Saint Louis, that G.I. free loot club
Stood in line so long man, wore my legs down to a nub
I hit the road again, yes, I hit the road again
Can't find no place to settle, so I hit the road again

I thought I'd made it, Jack in good old Albuquerque
I was on the wrong track, you know they tried to make me work
Ain't that a killer? I hit the road right quick
Yes, that judge was much too slick
Can't find no place to settle, woo, I hit the road right quick

Then Las Vegas was the next stop, that fast town left me weak
The dice man made twelve passes and I was up the well-known creek
Those gamblers put me down, yes, I had to walk right out of town
Um, um, that ain't no place to settle, um, I had to walk right out of town

Ah, but I hit the greatest town of all, Frantic Frisco
Got me a gal with plenty gold, and she just won't let me go
I think I've found a place, yes, I got my boots all laced
Found me a home, don't have to roam
It's good news, I've lost those roamin' blues

Louis Jordan,"Doug the jitterbug, 
Just a silly lug, 
Young and wild with lots of style, 
That's Doug the jitterbug! 

Just a crazy mug, 
Drinks liquor by the jug, 
He's alive with lots of jive, 
Doug the jitterbug! 

They threw him out of school 
'Cause all he learned was Tiger Rag, 
He never knew the golden rule, 
But boy, how he can shag! 

Doug the jitterbug, 
Cuts a wicked rug, 
It ain't no shame, he's not to blame, 
He's Doug the jitterbug! 

He studied to be a lawyer, 
But he never got a case, 
Every time they'd look for that cat in court 
He'd be doing the pantywaist!

Louis Jordan,"Out at the club tonight.  
Ole Richard went home early - he's got the key to the house.  
I'm gonna knock on the door, see if I can get in.

Open the door, Richard!!  
Ya see, Richard sleeps in the back room.  
It's kinda hard to hear.  
Maybe I better knock a little louder.

Open the door, Richard!!  
I don't think Richard heard me yet.  
Knock one more time-let's see what's gonna happen.

Richard, open the door, please.

Open the door, Richard
Open the door and let me in
Open the door, Richard
Richard, why don't you open that door?

Richard, open the door,
Man it's cold out here in this air.  
Now look, there's that old woman  'cross the street lookin' out the window

(Who's that, Widow Sweet?)

That must be her sister, I guess. 
She wants to make sure this is me.  
She's tryin' to find out what's happenin'. 
Yes, it's me and I'm late again!

(Did you hear what the lady's sayin'?)
No, what is she sayin'?
(She said you sure look common out here in the street.)
Common?  Man, I got class I ain't never used yet.  
I'm gonna knock again - Richard's got to get up.
Open the door, Richard!!  
Man, you got a key to the house?
(No, I don't have a key.  I don't have a key.)
Somebody's got to get in the house.  
We can't climb in the transom.
(Oh, I know he's in there.)
How you know he's in there?
(I can hear him breathin'.)
Ooooh, let's try it one more time!
Richard, open that door, man.  
Maybe Richard's gone.  

Open the door, Richard
Open the door and let me in
Open the door, Richard
Richard, why don't you open that door? 

I know he's in there. 

(How you know he's in there?)

Why, you got on the suit.

I know I got on the only suit.  
Ain't got but one suit between us.  
That's the reason why I don't like to room with nobody.

Richard, why don'tcha open the door, man?","Open the Door, Richard"
Louis Jordan,"Say!
Everyone's talking 'bout chicken;
Chicken's a popular bird;
Anywhere you go, you're bound to find,
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird.

Some folks call it a fowl,
That's the story I heard,
But let 'em call it this and let 'em call it that,
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird.

You can boil it, roast it, broil it,
Cook it in a pan or a pot,
Eat it with potatoes, rice or tomatoes,
But chicken's still what you got, boy!

It was a dish for old Caesar,
Also King Henry the Third,
But Columbus was smart, said ""You can't fool me,
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird.""

Louis Jordan,"Let the cats all criticize,
Joke about my baby's size,
She's reet with me because you see,
I likes 'em fat like that.

When she bounces down the street,
She's a whole heap of honey and ain't she sweet,
Feels so fine to know that she is mine,
I likes 'em fat like that.

You can have all those lean chicks tender and tall,
But when it comes to mean kicks,
A big fat momma's the best of all,
After I get through working well I reach and grab my hat,
And I hurry home,
Don't want her to be alone, cause 
I likes 'em fat like that.",I Like 'Em Fat Like That
Louis Jordan,"It made me cry 
To say good-bye, 
I'm sad and blue,
Now that you've gone 
I can't go on 
Away from you. 

I smile to hide 
The tears inside, 
It's hard to do, 
My happiness, 
My life's success 
Depends on you. 

The hours seem long, 
The world goes wrong, 
When we're apart, 
My skies are gray, 
What can I say

That I'm not blue, 
Oh, can't you see

Than a great big hunk o' lead

If your life hangs by a thread 
If you ain't got no red corpuscles 
Jack, you're dead

But you stubbed your toes 
When you ups and kicks the bucket 
Just like ole man Mose' 

When you get no kicks from lovin' 
And the news begins to spread 
All the cats will holler ""murder"" 
Jack, you're dead

If your friends gather round the bed 
And look at you and say ""Mm mm, don't he look natural?""

Than a great big hunk of lead
And if you don't respond to romance
Jack, you're dead!

When a chick is smiling at you
Even though there's nothing said
If you stand there like a statue
Jack, you're dead!

You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man mose

When you get no kicks from loving
And you blow your top instead
It's a fact that you ain't living
Jack, you're dead!

If you just ain't got nobody
Since you've gone and lost your head
Rigor Mortis has set in daddy
Jack, you're dead!

What's the use of having muscles
When your life hangs by a thread
If you ain't got no red corpuscles
Jack, you're dead!

You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man mose

When you get no kicks from loving
And the news begins to spread
All the cats will holler, ""Murder!""
Jack, you're dead!

All the breath is leaked out of you
When your friends gather 'round the bed
Look at you and say, ""Don't he look natural""
When that happens to you, daddy
Jack, you're dead!

Louis Landon,"Al borde de una laguna 
Tres brujas montan caldero 
Y baten un mundo espeso

Una le pone la luna
Otra sangre de cordero
Y otra los últimos besos

De camelot vuelan señales 
En los dragones y los cuernos 
Y hay un silencio de animales 
Mientras se anuncian los infiernos

El odio al otro es nuestra suerte 
La sangre ajena es nuestra viña 
Cuando profanen y den muerte
Seremos aves de rapiña

Los contrahechos del norte 
Y un enano de alcahuete 
Sádicos abominables

Reclutan tribus y cortes 
Para gestión de grilletes 
Y corazones de sables

Y una vez más como tragedia 
Ronda el olor a carne rota 
De calabozo de edad media 
Donde callaban al ilota 

Y una vez más contra el impulso 
De besar y abrazar a gentes 
Ceder al último recurso 
Ojo por ojo, y diente a diente",Camelot

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Louis Nelson,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

When through the kitchen door, up popped her father

But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Louis Prima,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby, you're my flame

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy-o don't you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

I met a trumpet playin' character and man alive
When he began to rip, he really played it from the hip
And when I asked about his name, they told me, that's The Lip
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

He's got a tone that's reminiscent of a boy named Bix
He plays so high that only dogs can hear him, just for kicks
And when I asked him does he read
He says, I'll tell you, hon'
I read a little bit but not enough to hurt me none
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

I said The Lip
(She must mean Ray Anthony, huh)
I said The Lip
(No, man, she means Harry James)
I said The Lip
(You mean Louis Prima)
I said The Lip
(Noo, Lip er ace)
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

I never heard a trumpet player play a note so high
I had to coax a lot before The Lip would tell me why
Then he took out a little jar that's labelled high note grease
And he rubs a little every night on his mouthpiece
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

Listen here gal, are you kiddin' about all that high note grease?
No, man, I swear, he had ten in a big valise
Wha', you mean he goes to the drugstore
And gets them from the medicine shelf?
No, some cat's told me he makes it himself
(Yip yip yip yip)
Tell us the secret of The Lip

Well, you take a bucketful of steam
And a dozen rooster eggs
And you mix 'em up gently with a bushel full of goldfish legs
And ya hang 'em on a sky hook in the midnight sun
Mmm and then you fry them until they're done
(Yip yip yip yip)
That's the secret of The Lip",The Lip

Banana split for my baby

Serve my chick a mess of calories

Banana split for my baby

Slip back the lid, scoop everything in sight
Make it a rainbow of red, brown and white
Chocolate chip and everything that's nice
Tutti-frutti once and spumoni twice

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me

Spray the whipped cream for at least an hour
Pile it as high as the Eiffel Tower
Load it with nuts, about sixteen tons
Top it with a pizza just for fun

Banana split for my baby

Stack her up with crazy goo
'Cause that's the stuff she likes to wade right through

Banana split for my baby

Now add the cherries the kind she loves to munch
Skip one banana, use the whole darn bunch
Drown it in fudge, six or seven cans
Give her two spoons, she'll eat it with both hands

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me

Separate checks, it must be
Charge the split to her, the water to me

Oh the banana split's for my baby
And the glass of plain water's for me
Ain't got no money

Louis Prima,"I search for phrases
To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are!

You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby, amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean, they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much
And just too very, very

And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

The kind she loves to munch
Skip one banana
Use the whole darn bunch
Drown it with fudge
Six or seven cans
Give her two spoons
She'll eat it with both hands

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me

Charge the split to her

And the glass of plain water's for me

Louis Prima,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day

Just made that much silk and then crawled in the ground

Louis Prima,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.

Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.

If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane;
Can't keep still, Tho it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree;
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody Grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan?, Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues

Why, if you told me night was day, I wouldn't doubt it.
Baby, if you told me that the world I thought was round, was flat,
Not one of my eyelids would bat, I'm easily touted.
But when it comes to matters of the heart,
I, and my belief in you, just part

I kind of believed you when you said your nights were lonely,
Til the day that I came by.
But when you whisper'd that I was your one and only 
That was a big fat lie.

I should have been wiser than I was and seen right through you,
But the moon got in my eye.
That stuff about ""I never lived until I knew you"" 
That was a big fat lie.

You must have started to fib when you were wearing a bib,
And such a habit's hard to break.
A little lie is OK, but when you lie night and day,
That's more than even I can take.

You told me we ought to marry and I let you sway me,
Kissed my happy days goodbye,
And when you told that man you'd honour and obey me

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody (And Nobody Cares for Me)

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Louis Stewart,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Louis Stewart,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Alone on a hill

Is keeping perfectly still

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

 We used to know

 The days that we were turning
 Each other round
 When the lights went down
 I don't know why I pushed you baby

 I didn't realise boy what I had in you
 I gotta change you but I don't know how
 I only wish that you could hear me now

 I can't take another breath 'til
 I'm down with you baby

Walking down these roads
Been searching outside
For some tender love

Louise,"Woke up this morning
I opened up my eyes
To see the sun was shining through

There was something special
I couldn't help but smile
Baby, as I remembered you

Turn away, dig along
They play my favorite song
Found an old photograph
Remembered how you made me laugh

Reminds me of you, there was no better
We thought we had nothing to lose
Reminds me of when, oh yeah, we were together
All the things you and I used to do
Reminds me of you, yeah

The first time I saw you
We must have talked for hours
I guessed we put the world to right, yeah

You drove me crazy
You drove me home at night
I never wanted to say goodbye

Like I know, movie scene
Wasn't real or make believe
Heaven knows, I can't forget
Memories are all that's left

Reminds me of you, oh yeah, there was no better
We thought we had nothing to lose
Reminds me of when we were together
All the things you and I used to do
Reminds me of you

Reminds me of you, there was no better
Reminds me of you, remember our first kiss
Remember, that's what I miss
Everything reminded me of you

Turnin' up radio, radio on
They're playing our favorite song
Found an old photograph
Remembered how you made me laugh

Reminds me of you, oh yeah, there was no better
We thought we had nothing to lose
Reminds me of when we were together
All the things you and I used to do
Reminds me of you

Reminds me of you, there was no better
We thought we had nothing to lose
Reminds me of when we were together
All the things you and I used to do
Reminds me of you

Reminds me of you, there was no better
We thought we had nothing to lose

Louise,"'Cause I had a dream, I was an Egyptian Queen
Floating down the Nile in serious style
I thank the sun for making you my king
And I never wanna wake up from this dream

I close my eyes and I fell asleep
In the twilight hour, something happened to me
When I woke up so surprised to see
That I had become an Egyptian Queen

I don't wanna stop this dreaming
I just wanna keep believing

'Cause I had a dream, I was an Egyptian Queen
Floating down the Nile in serious style
I thank the sun for making you my king
And I never wanna wake up from this dream
No, no never

In my adventure you're holding me
My Egyptian God, you're my Ramses
And we'll get lost in this mystery
To the big romance, won't you come with me?

I don't wanna stop this dreaming
I just wanna keep believing
This dream will never go away
Not even in the light of day

'Cause I had a dream, I was an Egyptian Queen
Floating down the Nile in serious style
I thank the sun for making you my king
And I never wanna wake up from this dream
No, no never

Can I be your own Egyptian Queen?
I will never tire with my Ramses beside me, yeah
Let me be your own Egyptian Queen
We can live forever in this golden fantasy

'Cause I had a dream, I was an Egyptian Queen
Floating down the Nile in serious style

Years went by, what was it that was said

I can't remember why
Do you remember why?
I can't remember why
I was ever mad at you?

I'm feeling like an idiot, 'cause I forget what you went and did
I'm certain it was some kinda mistake
I was young and broke your heart, I was needy
Was it smart for me to break it up and run way

Is this a well learned lesson
Doesn't makes me a better person than I was
Even if to have you, it's too late

I can't remember why
Do you remember why?
I can't remember why

We kill the love we keep inside

He turned the wheel so bravely
Was his aim to save me

Separating you from me
You might have been from what will be
Only water, only water

Thursday's child has far too gone
Perfect frozen, stolen moment
A passing glance, a lifetime chance

Dive, die with you

Louise Goffin,"Doc give dad some medicine
Her voice is in his head
Quite anesthesia
Never found out what they said

Sometimes still remembers
Few scratched in time it seems
Though quite anesthesia
Exploring the seams

I watched you my whole life
Givin' in to myth of guilt
When all you did was stay up late
Tipping all yours into milk

Silver hair, cigarette
And something on TV

Louise Goffin,"When I wake up in the morning
And the 'larm gives out a warning
I don't think I'll ever make it on time
By the time I grab my books,
And I give myself a look,
I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by
It's alright 'cause I'm saved by the bell
If the teacher pops a test,
I know I'm in a mess,
And my dog ate all my homework last night,
Ridin' low in my chair,
She won't know that I'm there,
If I can hand it in tomorrow, it'll be all right!

Lay your blanket on my bed
Then you can sleep with me instead

I don't care who it might be, it's not for me

And you stretched up on my bed, like I said

And all the city lights collide

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,

I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

Staten Island been wildin', so Osama's nothing
And my niggaz out in Brooklyn said Saddam was frontin'

Picture Me Rollin', holdin' less than a one or somethin'
You fake faggots, yeah we got that big automatic
Like, Bruce Willis and the Jackal type, yeah, right
You want to see it? Then get on my nerves
Oh you live, and I'm gettin' money spit on my curb
In the hood where it get no harder, only tougher
Crack fiends suffer, baby moms, baby brother
Hustlin', still forty off a hundred packs
I'd rather lounge in the back of the bar
Me and my dog throw crack in the jar
Listen to this rap star, while I sit back in the car
And I told ya'll niggaz how the Staten rock
We don't, trick on chicks, yo we clap them shots
You get caught if you ask a lot, like you don't know
And where you at, then ya ass is got

Conceived with slow jams by The Delfonics
At a level that you should of been years ago
Responsible usually for coke traffic, usually for broken bone tragic
Rest in peace, to Mayor Guliani's term
They say I'm wrong, shit
I'm try'nna see 26, with my daughters at the Emmy Awards
All around the ball glowin', they got the weed flow droughted
Or maybe niggaz in the hood just ain't 'bout it
Talkin' Hercules, and ain't nothin' but dog food
Staten Island, New York City drools
Crazy glue on my fingerprints
Name on the concrete of my hood, what's really good?
Vendetta's with these rap stars
Frontin' like this crime and the pet is they cars
Believe I was God in my last life
What if it was your knife? What if they was your gloves, nigga..

Aiyo, I came into this game on some real love shit
And ya'll bitch ass niggaz, ya'll wanted me to quit
Because the way I dress ill and the way that I spit
But I ain't never gon' stop, droppin' these joints
And ya'll fake ass niggaz, ya'll ain't gettin' no points
Don't try to sabotage me, 'cause you just can't do it
You had me in the Square, last year, but you blew it
Big Donna from the group home, that's my word
Splash shots at your whip, splash shots at your bird
Leave your brains and your Gucci boots up on the curb
Pillage for life, Allah's will be the most superb
Smoke weed with the cannon, smoke the herb
So bow down, all you crab ass clowns you can't live
My gun's on empty, but it's more shots to give
I pop you like a slave cop, run in your crib
Throw darts at your wife, throw darts at your kid
Leave your house flooded with hits like O.J. did
Escapin' the crime scene and you love how I slid

Waking up sleepy eyed
He says there's something about a highway

Getting ready for the next time.

Love,"We saw a sad girl walkin' a while ago
Said she didn't have her sweetheart anymore
But there was some place that she just had to be
And that was inside of some lonely room with me

But I had to leave or else my wife would starve
Then she said, “There's something else I've gotta do
And that's be inside some lonely room with two”

That's 'balony, just the same
No, I don't care if you're from Abalony
That's 'balony, just the same, just the same

Now here's another verse that's good for you
And that all that's good might not be good for you
And the things that people sometimes say are bad
It's because it's something that they never had

Oh, I don't care if you're from Abalony

He went down to the people that he used to know

And thought they looked different they still were the same

Are all that we hear in our ears
And even the King sometimes thinks a little weird
The same as all the rest and I'll give you my best

With the way that they're trapped in

I believe what they say, ignorance is bliss

I punish myself
I've done no wrong
Believe this world will take
And it won't be long
When the stars fall down
And I fall in love

All I want to do is flow
With the river of people
The bottom of my wishing well
Is an ocean of steel
In my dreams I go
To the river of people
Help me, help me to
Make my dreams come true

I could tell you how but I could not tell you why
I've been sold, fools gold
And bought all the things that money can't buy
??? that once I was in love with a pretty girl
She never broke my heart
I broke my heart myself

But I've waited so long
For the sun to shine
Thought that I just might be wrong
?? and ???
Don't tell me your dreams
Cause I don't want to know

[Chorus]

Help me help me
Help me help me

I've been to paradise and I don't like what I've seen
Things I thought were so sweet only ????
Life can be so cutting life can be so cruel
I believe that life has left me sitting on a monkey stool

Help me help me to
Make my dreams come true (Repeat x4)

All I want to do is flow

Love and Money,"Move your lazybones
You've got a burden of proof
Prove it to yourself
Find out the truth

There are no tears in our eyes
That were no already cried
I'll be there tonight
Waiting for you

We'll set sail on when the seas are rough
And we'll twist and turn on the axis of love

Call it foolishness
Call it cowardice
But I'd sell all my secrets
Just to touch your lips

Honey, I've just dawned
On what the night has pawned
You may be scared
But you're not alone

We'll set sail on when the seas are rough
And we'll twist and turn on the axis of love

You might say
I'm just smouldering after the fire
We can't just succumb to
The deception of desire
But if you'll only hear me out
Might I make a suggestion?
Listen to your heart
Don't ask questions.

We scratch and bite
Through what we can't say
But I feel tonight
We could find a way
I don't know what I'll do
If I can't see you somehow
Come to me
Rescue me now

We'll set sail on when the seas are rough
And we'll twist and turn on the axis of love

Sometimes you don't know what you're fighting for
You don't know who it is you despise.

Some worlds are held together by sellotape
He was drifting through the sharks teeth
He always paid his dues
When something told him he had nothing
That's when he knew he had nothing to lose

Again my patience makes the climb
Will my tears buy me time?

You're at the center of everything I do
Wherever I go, I'll walk the last mile with you

and run to fall in these meadows""

Love and Rockets,"Thinking of your private future
You snatched at the trees
In the starry dark green sleep
Thinking of your private future
You think at the river and set it flowing
A late fog's lifting a fast wind's rising
So you turn to reflect on your brief life
Session slip

Thinking of your private future
Cut by the scars of timeless coming back
Realize the unreachable is nothing
Cool winds wash down your hope and you slipped
Cool winds wash down your hope and you slipped

God's good to the humble
As the devil is to fools
Stop looking back in anger
Cause you can't change the rules
Believe in where you're going
But don't lose your yesterdays
To terrify to cry its true
Your life is just a game

So I need a million dollars
To sit on mountain tops
To see the stars surround you
Is to see an awful lot
I see the work of sinners
I see the work of saints
So I see the work of everyone
That's ever ever been

Sleep without reason
Your laughing masks your love
You've got so many scars 
How does it feel deep in your heart?

Cause when the covers blown over
It'll crack up your skin
So now you're drowning your sorrows
In whiskey and sin

Live the life you love
In the god you trust
And don't take it all to seriously

Love and Rockets,"Deep down in the city 'neath the concrete trees
Some signifying hack is scratching backs for fleas
Putting on their bad mouths for poor little me
Spreading ugly lies like it's some horrible disease

He said that I said what I never did said
But I said that it's rare that it's over your head
Ask me a question, then print a lie
I cancelled all appointments having vowed that he will die

So I went to find the source of this malitious dirt
Having reread the words and wiped the blood from my shirt
When I found him he was sitting high up in a tree
With one bloody finger on a typewriter key

Sky is gray and the grass unseen
And you're the dumbest **** this city's ever seen
He was laughing, shaking, high up in a tree
But then he lost his balance and he fell down on his knees

So I leapt on that mother my anger to appease
When I grabbed him by the throat, he said ""Oh spare me please""
Sure as gullible as my name I let him go back to the trees
And straight away the poisons flowing freely from the keys

The sky is grey and the grass unseen
And he's still the dumbest **** this concrete jungle's ever seen
That mother he was laughing, bathing in the heat
But then he slipped again and landed in the street

Deep down in the city 'neath the concrete trees
Nobody's seen that mother high in the fleas

And it shows four stars where the name oughta be

Had a dream...

I was riding on a train that wasn't bound for glory
Riding on a train, the train was bound for hell
Riding on a train that wasn't bound for glory, that's for sure
Riding on a train that's bound for hell

The engine with human blood was damp
The headlight was her brimstone lamp
And then for fuel I shoveled in bones
and the furnace roared with a thousand groans

The tank was filled with lager beer
The devil himself was engineer
The passengers were a mixed up crew
The churchman in his battered suit

The rich in broadcloth, poor in rags
Handsome girls, wrinkled hags
Black men, yellow, red and white
Chained together, fearful sight

The dream was storming at full pace
The sulfer fumes burned hands and face
Wilder and wilder the country grew
Faster and faster the engine flew

Loud and terrible thunder crashed
Whiter brighter lighing flash
Hotter still the air became
So clothes will burn from each shrinking frame

There came a fearfull ear-splitting yell...
Yell Satan: ""dance, the next stop's hell""
Twas then the passengers shrieked with pain
And begged the devil to stop the train
Stop this train

He shrieked and roared, and grinned with glee
And mocked and laughed at their misery
""My friends you've bought your seats on this road,
I've got to get through with a complete load""

You've pulled in the weak, you've cheated the poor
You starving tramp, you turned from the door
You've up gold till your purses bust
You've give a beastly lust

You've mocked at god in your hellful pride
You've killed and you've cheated, and plundered and lied
You've come across men and you've swore and you've stole
Not a one in body and soul
Body and soul

So you've paid full fare and I'll carry you through

If there's one 

And here's a time when I ain't no liar

A land that will save you, a land of fire

And your flesh will scorch in the flames that roar

You'll sizzle and burn from



And I awake with a thrilling cry

My were clothes were wet, my hair stood high

And I prayed as I've never until that hour

To be saved from hell and the devil's power



At present my vows were not in vain

That I payed no fare on that hellbound train ",Bound for Hell

Love and Rockets,"I was rollin? down the window of my car
And I was thinkin? where the game had got me so far

Doesn't matter where you're goin? or where you're comin? from
Or is your life just like a grain of sand?
Fuck all else

Well, I was rollin? down the highway of my dreams
And I was wonderin? 'bout Hollywood sunsets and the silver screen

Doesn't matter where you're goin? or where you're comin? from
Or is your life just like a grain of sand?
Fuck all else

Doesn't matter where we're goin? or where we're comin? from
Or is your life just like a grain of sand?
Fuck all else

Rollin? down the highway in a dream
I was rollin? down the highway in a dream
Just rollin? down the highway in a dream

Just rollin?, just rollin'
Just rollin?, just rollin'

I'll get back to you on that
How many spells and dollars does it take to make the magic
Of pulling legends from your hat?

Will they take another sucker for an undersell?
Regarding them with compliments and muskatelle
A honeymoon in Vegas in a plush hotel
Well, that's a sad town in the morning light

How many bullets in the back does it take
To kill a singing cowboy?
How much more of this bullshit can you take
From the charming envoy?

When you're making with the ballpoint on the dotted line
The Devil's in his heaven and your hair sublime
You fit the mold for stardom and the big bells chime
But it's gold leaf on a wild, wild, wind

And they're serving up your future with a twist of lime
Paying you in dollars for the perfect crime
And you're scratching off the silver for a nail of grime
And pissing in that bitter wind

Last month's color you've passed your sell by date
And your days are numbered

My backs about to break, no money in the bank, and she don't call me anymore.
I'm down to my last ring, it's time to sell my things

And from the rear-view, I've got clear view of who I used to be.

With a bottle laying in the bed
There was a little, a little bit left
So I picked it up and I killed the rest

But what scares me to death

Broke all but one of my Lord's 10

Love as Laughter,"Grab some grapes and leaves, man
You can never tell
When you'll have to change your face
And hide your trophies well

Comin? down the mountain
Or goin? to your home
The village has evacuated
Now you gotta roam

Your feet could start to moan
And your eyes don't see too clear
The darkest dreams could come
And shake your faith to steer

Remember the sun
All from memory
Close your eyes and run circles
?Round its enemies

Remember the sun
Before you awake
Remember all the reasons
And bake it into your cake

Then we'll all come over
Bring the coconut flakes
We're gonna get stoned with ya
Laugh at your mistakes

I know it's been hard to take
And I know you wanna run
But just try to stay in one place
And have a little fun

I know it's been hard to take
And I know you wanna run
But just try to stay in one place
And dance before it's done

Holding on to all that matters is now lost
I try to wipe these tears away
But the fight is much too constant these days

I want you to be my lover
And I don't want to face another night like this
And these lips won't touch another
Not as long as there's a longing for your kiss

Pray for me before I break
These chains of sanity that kjeep me at bay
Memories like cigarette stains
On porcelain

I want you to be my lover
And I don't want to face another night like this
And these lips won't touch another
Not as long as there's a longing for your kiss

I'm standing still
But where do I go from here?
I'd rather run away
Than spend another day running out of tears

For too long
Oh yea, and how could I forget
The complications you have failed to comprehend?
I know I know you're wasting time
You're wasting time on me
Now I can See

Tell me do you still have pieces of me
Cause I'm not complete at all
We can try, we can try but we're never gonna get it right
Unless we fall

And now that all is said and done
I guess it's time to turn our backs and run
Away so I can finally take the break that I deserve
Then while we're at it we can slowly build this bridge
And burn it to the ground in a matter of 10 seconds

Love of Lesbian,"Quiero planear sobre tu tierra estable
Quisiera regresar a ese viento suave

Cuando yo solo era brisa
Acuérdate bien, que al no poder mirarme
Sabía que existía solo si a ti te podía mover

De casi todos mis viajes, 
De ahí me llevé varias canciones de aire
Recuerdos de viajes que mares del trópico adquirí

Fue después de veinte inviernos
Acuérdate bien, por las presiones de aire
Los círculos radiales se empezaron a expandir

Mientras tanto tú, tú tan anclada en tus raíces
Con esfuerzo percibiste que invertí mi dirección

Y de quien siembra vientos, 
¿Qué se dice? Ya lo sabes
Solo cuando te quebraste, 
Solo entonces me di cuenta, era yo

El huracán de una escala descomunal
Crecido en su arrogancia por sí mismo 
Dio una vuelta en espiral
Y ese huracán con la luz de lunas de hiel
A mil metros del suelo 
A duras penas se dio cuenta que arrasó bajo el volcán

Toda sed de comprender cualquier motivo, el sinsentido
Ha dejado a hombres de ciencia sin salir de sus porqués

Fenómenos del mal, desastres, que vienen y van
Que van, que van, que van sucediendo
Sin aviso fiable o preventiva medición

Tu tierra antes dormida de tu lava se llenó

Ya no hay nada en mí, solo restos que destruyen
Y mi huracán de una escala de fuerza seis
Crecido en su arrogancia a duras penas 
Se dio cuenta que arrasó bajo el volcán, 
Tu volcán
Ni siquiera el mismo diablo lo haría mejor

Y el huracán de una escala descomunal
Crecido en su arrogancia 
Por sí mismo dio una gran vuelta en espiral
Y ese huracán quiso huir de su propio ser
Se fue a otras ciudades convencido que a tus islas

Love of Lesbian,"Cuando el mago enfermó era día de función

Y el pájaro sonrió con la mirada más triste del sur
El gran truco final
Fue abrir las ventanas: ""un nuevo mago encontrarás si a los ojos miraras""

Del indomable e inolvidable Halley Star?

Fue mi gran invención
Pero no ha vuelto más a buscarme
Adivinando antes que yo mi deserción

Ahora mi porche sin luz
Si caen gotas avisando que hay tormentas
Ya vuelvo a pensar en volver atrás

Quiero volver al azul
El que sentía pilotando aeroplanos de tinta y papel
Y de aeropuerto un diario en blanco

¿Dónde estás planeador?
Quiero el perfume del ahora y el aroma de una flor de piel
Yo que pensaba que aún volaba
Y era inercia

Que alguien me salve
A veces despierto y soy yo
Y que alguien los pare
Empieza a cansar tanta ambición

Planeador, eleva grandes ideas
De la gente a quien no dejan despegar
Y en lo personal
Encuentra buques en selvas
Y ese cofre que aquel niño me escondió

Venme a buscar
Le bastaría un poema
O aquellos cuentos que al cobarde hacen andar
Fui un adulto precoz
Sietemesino de una nube azul y densa que me expulsó
Y que aprendió cayendo

Uuu, que los pegados a la tierra nos detestan
Solo por probar
De dar un paso al ras de cielo

¿Dónde estás planeador?
Lancé botellas desde playas tan desiertas
Que es mi piel coral
Y hasta el mar viendo mi sal de mi se ahuyenta

Que alguien me salve
A veces despierto y soy yo
Y que alguien los pare
Empieza a cansar tanta ambición

Y nunca a la pared
Y si me dejas aire

Si fueran puntos grises mis rarezas
Cada tara que creé
De seguirlos con un lápiz al final
Verías mi cara en el papel
Por eso
Estoy por aquí otra vez
Rebuscando en mi almacen esa palabra
Cónsul de mi timidez
Ojalá encuentre la forma
Más me vale
Tengo un tema que acabar
Si no aparece nunca

O entiendo que no di con la palabra justa
Y cuando al fin la encuentro llega aquel mar de dudas
Si cuando me decido tú me detienes siempre
Me aprietas justo aquí y dices
No, mi leal traidor, inspiración
Cuando apareces menos hoy
Y soy
Te quedarás dormida

Es peor mi geniocidio

Sí, la voy a soltar
La quiero soltar
Pronunciaré 'esperanza'
La gritaré por dentro si es lo que hace falta

La escribiré mil veces, me alejaré de espaldas
Quizás de repetirla algo me quede
No puedo permitir tu negación
Mi leal traidor inspiración
De intermitente aparición
Como un ángel hallado en un ascensor
Qué bien funcionas como recuerdo
Acojo en mi hogar
Palabras que he encontrado abandonadas en mi palabrera
Examino cada jaula y allí
Ladrando vocales y consonantes
Encuentro sucios verbos
Que lloran después de ser abandonados
Por un sujeto que un día fue su amo
Y de tan creído que era

Prescindió del predicado
Esta misma semana
Han encontrado a un par de adjetivos transtornados
A tres adverbios muertos de frio
Y a otros tantos de la raza pronombre
Que sueñan en sus jaulas
Con ser la sombra de un niño
Señalo entonces
A las palabras que llevan más días abandonadas
Y me las llevo a casa
Las vacuno de la rabia y las peino a mi manera
Como si fueran hijas únicas
Porque en verdad todas son únicas
Acto seguido
Y antes de integrarlas en un parbulario de relatos o canciones
Les doy un beso de tinta
Y les digo que si quieres ganarte el respeto
Nunca hay que olvidarse los acentos en el patio

A veces les pongo a mis palabras
Diéresis de colores imitando diademas
Y yo sólo observo como juegan en el patio de un poema
Casi siempre te abandonan demasiado pronto
Y las escuchas en bocas ajenas
Y te alegras, y te enojas contigo mismo
Como con todo lo que amamos con cierto egoísmo
Y uno se queda en casa
Inerte y algo vacío
Acariciando aquel vocablo mudo llamado silencio
Siempre fiel, siempre contigo
Pero todo es ley de vida

Si las palabras se atraen
Que se unan entre ellas
Y a brillar
Que son dos sílabas",El Poeta Halley

Porque esta vida debacle
Sea media parte
De un todo que te dé mucho más
Más, más, más
Que los amigos de antes
Sean de ahora y siempre
Y no nos fallen más por detrás
No hay más, no hay más

I've got a friend who's not really my friend
But I hate him just like everybody does
He's got the scooter he's got the haircut
He's got the eyeballs - he's always so fantastic

If you want to be unusual
You should listen to yourself
If you want to be all different
You should get out of bed
If you want to be so famous
You should listen to yourself

He stole a magazine
'dancing queen'
The frontpage girl called marilyn
She looked pretty, lean
And quite obscene

He knew
She'd never let him down
Like every other one in town
She was the only one

Marilyn the dancing queen
Was smiling from his
Tv screen
Marilyn the dancing queen
Was always loving in his
Sweetest dream

He tried to call the magazine
Left a message on
Their answer machine
That his in love with marilyn
If she could phone him back
He would be keen

She'd never let him down

That I'll never understand
I opened up to show you
Saw us walking hand in hand

now I feel so embarrassed
I was just disturbing you
But how could I keep it quiet
Didn't know what else to do

I had to have it all
And ran into a wall
And I didn't stop to see
Plain reality

now that I left the whirlpool
I'm walking straight again
My life is back to normal
But I've noticed it too late

how can I live my life for me
When everytime I close my eyes
There is you that I see
You're everywhere, can't run away

A fragile smile, an old clichée
Few hours to enjoy every day
Tomorrow'll be the same

But I don't want to be part of this game
They all try to touch my heart
But it seems I touch the stars instead
And now it feels like love is all dead

stuck in the wrong dimension
No one to blame nothing to mention
Another day of electric light
I'm locked inside this automatic life

I'll be alright
Oh yes, I'll be okay
But I'll still be dreaming
For you to come my way
I'll be alright
Oh yes, I'll be okay
But I'll still be waiting
For you to blow me away

I guess I'll take it all
The space, embrace, the rise and fall
Just something to hold on to and recall
I can't beat gravity 
The supreme dream of feeling free
I must be my own enemy

stuck in the wrong dimension
I'd give my soul for sweet redemption

Video me in this automatic life

I can't remember anymore
I must've passed out here on the floor
Ask myself why
The morning after the night before
I feel sick and my body's sore
I can't believe you walked out the door
The morning after the night before
I played the fool I played the whore
Another night of my private war
Ask myself why

why do I always abuse, why always want more
Why didn't I realise what I had before
Why couldn't I love and cherish
Why was I such a fool
The night before the morning after 
The night before

the morning after and I'm alone
You packed your bags and left for home
My last chance I have definitely blown
The morning after the life we had
Now love is dead just like my dad
Wished for a happy ending not one
So damned sad

I'm cashed up, tied up in the game, I'm stuffed up
Tuxedo bitches got a lap up,
I don't matter when the automorb throw my hat up, akup
Walk up, wondering why them bitches don't trust us,
Pussy coming in, I'ma need more rubbers,
Your bitch love us, she lick dick under covers,
Take cover, leave nothing on the tongue, girl
I like damn bitches in the valley, 
Working at them dalleys, porn star Valery,
Nice to meet, said she like the D, 
I like to be in fact like once a week
Once she get the akup, bitch, pack up,
Turn around, count the money, watch the shit add up
Turn around, get another bitch that's badder,
Ask fed up and then fuck her faster, nigga

Waste money before I waste my time,
Keep a bad bitch on my line
Real buzz, let me talk my shit,
Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick
And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup,
Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup

Bad bitches on my line, call it car waiting
niggas waiting on a sideline, they be hating
Four bitches on my whip, I'm a limit dating
All black karma, ask me of a nigga's hating
And I run myself like a really,
When a nigga play my songs, hand a bottle to the DJ
I rather kill her, I rather fuck your bitch, nigga,
You're at home, I'm on the road, getting rich, nigga
Enough of that shit, let me get back to the women,
‘'cause it's taking this bitch, I'm liking what I see
Give me more bottles, I'm trying to get drunk,
Wake up tomorrow, look to my right, ask who the fuck is you?
Please don't tell me what we do, 
Poundry, round two, high class biz', 
But best believe I'll ground you
Walk of shame, baby, let my homies crown you

Waste money before I waste my time,
Keep a bad bitch on my line
Real buzz, let me talk my shit,
Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick
And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup,
Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup",Akup
Loverboy,"I knew her since high school, we were seventeen
I was old enough to know she was old enough to dream
I try to remember, bring back memories
And you know that she is always on my mind

She knew what I needed, never let me down
She was always the last to leave, and the first to come around
I try to remember, bring back memories
And you know that she is always on my mind

Always on my mind
She's driving me crazy
Always on my mind
And you know that she is always on my mind

Every night in my dreams I still see her face
But she gave it up for me, she only gave me a taste
Every time I see her it comes back to me
And you know that she is always on my mind

Always on my mind
She's driving me crazy
Always on my mind
And you know, yes you know, yes you know

Oh yeah, always on my mind
She's driving me crazy
Always on my mind
And you know that she is always on my mind

Always on my mind
She's driving me crazy
Always on my mind
And you know, yes you know, yes you know
Always on my mind
Always on my mind",Always on My Mind
