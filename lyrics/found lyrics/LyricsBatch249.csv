King Diamond,"Missy I miss You so. Oh little Sister
I wish You'd come back to Me and sit by My side
We'd laugh and we'd play again, if only You'll try
You know ""THEY"" would show the way
From the other side
Rise from Your grave little Sister

Rise . . . Rise . . . Rise My friends . . . Rise
Spirits rising from their grave
Burning shadows in the dead of night
Icy fingers all over My hand
Try to make Me understand
""Finally we have returned . . . All of us""

Missy is that You, come closer
Spirits rising from their grave
Everywhere that ghostly stare
Icy fingers all over My hand
Lead me back to where she stands
""THEY"" are back to share My life . . . ""THEY"" are back

Missy come, come with Me, there are things I must know
How did you get here, where's the door to the other side
Missy: ""Beyond the graves lies the gate
the gate that leads to the dead
We have to leave before the dawn
if not by the sun we will burn""

Spirits rising from their grave
soon the dawn will chase the dark away
Icy fingers all over My hand
Lead Me back to where ""THEY"" stand
Am I glad You have returned . . . All of you

Do You remember when Grandmother said she heard ""THEM"" sing
I've heard ""THEM"" too and I really wish I could hear ""THEM"" again
Missy: ""In Your mind You'll hear ""THEM"" sing
every night at the graves
we have to leave before the dawn
if not by the sun we will burn
now sing""

King Diamond,"""Who's gonna set fire to the coffin?""

""I think You and Your wife to be
Should do it together, while I keep
The demon inside with My crucifix""

King Diamond,"Yesterday I spent an hour
A full hour in therapy
My favourite Doctor Landau
My God I hate his breath

He asked me questions
That kind of fool deserves a lie
I gave him answers
The kind of answers Doctor like
Yes, I gave him a bunch of lies

I told him all My nightmares
Were dead and gone
""These days I sleep like a baby
And there never ever was a ""THEM""

He asked me questions
That kind of fool deserves a lie
I gave him answers
The kind of answers Doctors like

The Doctor looked at My eyes
Landau: ""No trace of insanity
Maybe the time is right now
To have a visit from the family
I'm thinking of Your Mother
What does My little patient say?""

I should have taken his stethoscope
And then forced it down his throat
My Mother was at stake
So I behaved

That night I cleaned the entire house
For everything but the memories
No dust, no tea, ah stupid me
I even took the axe away
The sun is up and it's time for bed
I'm so tired
I can't wait no more",Lies
King Diamond,"I cannot sleep at night
That's what the day is for anyway
And as the clock strikes midnight
I hear them dancing at the graves
Singing to my mind
Killing the pain . . . sleepless nights . . . sleepless nights
I cannot sleep at night
That's what the day is for anyway
And as the clock strikes midnight
Only they can let us meet
Even though she's dead now
I gotta see her again . . . sleepless nights . . . sleepless nights
I cannot sleep at night
I will do anything to see missy again
Then let us make you an eternal deal
You will attend to the graves
You'll give us the house back and keep in mind
That we only come here at night.
So we made the deal under the starry night and
Amon belongs to them now . . .
I feel the dawn coming my way
And as the sun breaks up the dark
I can't hear them dance no more
There's no voices
Killing the pain . . . pain . . . pain",Sleepless Nights
King Diamond,"A little later in the day Mother and the Doctor went away
They left me lying on the floor
Heading for local church, no a trace of guilt in their eyes
The reverend Sammael, the venom of GOD himself
And so easy to convert

Conspiracy, I'm being victimized again

Knocking at the preacher's door
none of them were ever here before
Sammael, GOD in his eyes, leads them into the silent room
Oh such a holy gloom

""Priest, do You remember King, the loony one
the one who killed his Grandma' up on the hill?""
""Yes I do""

Conspiracy

""Now he's back, the loony one""

Talking to the preacher for a while
the Doctor turned him into a child
Sammael, GOD in his eyes, swallowed everything the Doctor said
Oh in the gloom of the night

""From what You tell Me we cannot save him
It could be Satan himselfg or some evil demon
Let us not waste any time, the demon might twist our minds
We must go and do what must be done""

Conspiracy, I am being victimized again...victimized

So they left the church, conspiracy of the cursed
Through the dark and the rain, the priest was mildly insane
A crucifix in his hand...Oh no...

""Soon the house belongs to us My dear
and King will be gone forever, isn't it just heaven?""",Victimized
King Diamond,"It must be summer the sky is clear
The garden is so beautiful
All the flowers and all the trees
Make Me feel like they're inside of Me
I'm holding My sister's hand
While we're playing in the sand
It's all but a dream

My bed is moving, I cannot see a thing
I am in total darkness, someone is calling
I can feel the chill, it's all around Me
I know it's not a dream, No no no

Someone is in My room
Standing at the end of My bed
Must be a visit from the dead
Must be a visit from the dead

Now I see her figure, it's just a little child
And there's no reflection, she's in the mirror
Could it really be, has she returned?
My little sister

""King beware, something bad is coming Your way
King beware""
Must be a visit from the dead
Must be a visit from the dead
Missy will You tell Me
You know we don't have no secrets
""Just beware""

Must be a visit from the dead
Must be a visit from the dead
You've to to tell Me Missy

""I will send You a dream,""",A Visit from the Dead
King Diamond,"My Mother is entering My dream now
She's wearing a wedding dress
Something's wrong with the way she walks the aisle
I think it's her legs

Suddenly there is someone else beside her
That man I recognize
The Doctor intends to marry Mother
It's got to be stopped

Now what have I done
My Mother's on the floor and the Doctor's gone
Everything is wrong
And as I keep the axe I wonder what's to come

I'm caught within a dream there's no way out
I can't escape
If only I could see the light of day
I might escape the dream
The wedding dream
Oh the dream

Now everything turns to darkness
Deep within I feel like I'm going blind
There is a light at the end of this starless nightmare
Someone's calling, guiding me back inside
The dream
No

Get away from him Mother
You better stop kissing, 'cause he's an enemy
Take at look at his hand
He's got the key to my house, the Doctor is the devil

I'm caught within a dream there's no way out
I can't escape
If only I could see the light of day
I might escape the dream
The wedding dream
Oh the dream

Dream, the wedding dream
Oh the dream

Now everything turns to darkness
Deep within I feel like I'm going blind
There is a light at the end of this starless nightmare
Someone's screaming: ""Help me please"" And it's Me

At sunrise I woke up in a sweat
The nightmare was gone
The dream I was sent is fading slowly
I do not understand",The Wedding Dream
King Diamond,"Walking in the garden, picking flowers in the sun
Madeleine is on her own
She can't see any of the other nuns
Is she blind or is it her mind
What's going on? What's going on behind these walls...

All the birds are singing, but Madeleine can't hear their song
Memories of screams in the night
Moaning coming from below where the prison cells are cold
She does not understand what's going on

Now the bell is ringing, communion time has come again
Is Father Picard really a friend?...

The sour tasting blood of Christ
What's going on? What's going on behind these walls...

What's going on? Behind these walls...",Behind These Walls
King Diamond,"Oh mama don't walk away
I'm a goddamn sore loser
I ain't too proud to stay

But I'm still thinking 'bout you
And I'm so lonesome without you
And I can't get you out of my mind

Oh mama don't leave me alone
With my soul sat down so tight it's like a stone cold tomb
Ain't it clear when I'm near you

I'm just dying to hear you
Calling my name one more time
Oh so don't pay no mind

To my watering eyes
Must be something in the air
That I'm breathing

Yes'n I try to ignore
All this blood on the floor
It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

Oh mama don't walk away
You leave me here bereaving from the words so hard and plain
Saying the love that we had

Was just selfish and sad
To see you now with him
Is just making me mad

Oh so kiss him again
Just to prove to me that you can
An I will stand here

And burn in my skin
Yes I will stand here
And burn in my skin",Burn

It was only yesterday, thunder rolling by, breaking up the sky
And the rain was pouring down
Pounding on my brain, driving me insane
I was drinking wine again, oh yeah blame it on the wine

It was only the 1st of may, thunder rolling by, breaking up the sky
And the rain was pouring down
The inqusition came, I felt the pain
I had to relieve it all in just one day

If you look at the eye, it will take you back in time

Black clouds in the sky dancing before my eyes

Afraid of shame, she's crying out for help
To be clean again

No one cared and no one ever will
Her feelings were not shared, she wants to break the spell
and she's going

Into the convent, a smile on her face
Into the darkness to hide all her sins

Welcome Sister, I'm Your chaplain
Down on Your knees and pray if You please

Unfold Your wildest dreams, it's time to join and sing

That night she awoke to find The Eye
On the stone cold floor Why, She never ever would knoe why

7 figures walk the streets of Louviers
Picard is one, another two are priests
And then the nuns going to

Evil company full of secrecy, again and again

The room is dark
Candies on the wall, they've been here before
The christian cross is hanging high above
The altar of GOD

Madeleine is at the gate
Hazy feeling in her brain
As the strangers come in to

Evil company full of secrecy, again and again

King Diamond,"One little girl with dirty fingers
Playing with broken doll
As the other girl is lying
Digging deep into the ground
They seem to play an evil game
A game that doesn't have a name
Both of them are in the ashes
At the stake where witches burn

If only they could see beyond the ground they play on
The girls are laughing still, they think they're having fun
They should be far away, watching the sun go down

One little girl picked up a necklace
From the ashes of the witches
It had wings and then the other
cried out loud Now let me have it
The other looked without a sign
Right into the witch's eye
The kind of horror that she saw
Made her choke for evermore

Through the summer rain of 1845
The coach had finally arrived
To the valley where the crossroads meet below
And where all darkness seems to grow
People blame it on the Hill
The hill where no one dares to go
The Mansion

The coach had stopped and from the window you could see
Seven horsemen in the night
Miriam Natias and Jonathan LaFey
Saw the magic in their eyes
They were in for a surprise
The darkness would soon be complete
A horseman came forth from the dark

""We know you've come to inherit what's your's, the mansion
Take our advise and go back on this night
If you refuse eighteen will become nine, oh no""

""I don't believe a word You say""

I saw a man digging in the ground
Working the late shift, it was the gravedigger
Jeremiah had worked here for years
Already had one foot in the grave
With my help we got in the other
I can't believe, he wasn't stronger

To let the reverend fill up her purse
Jesse Bell, may his soul rest in hell

And there it was... The House of God

""This Place is terrible"" inscribed above the door
Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the church within

more a beast

King Diamond,"I'm back in the church... night has taken over
I'm breathing hard... in the dark
Through the hole in the floor, I hear the winds from the catacomb
Here it comes, out of the hole, a magnificent light

Blinding the entire church
Contorted faces and bodies too, powerful entity floating high above
I was no more scared of dying, but I was terrified of knowing the truth
I don't want to, but I have to... I have to know who you are

""You have entered where no human must go
You have seen the lie... the lie about the cross""
I am many... We are One, THE HIGHEST
You'll never know why We kept Him here

The one who did not die on the cross
Could it be We kept Him away from God... so that he may never walk
Never walk the Earth again?""
""Or could it be that We've kept Him... safe from YOU

So you may never try to do again what... you did back then?
I guess it all depends on who you are
I guess it all depends on who you really are""
""God and Satan are just puppets on OUR strings

""Live this life the best you can, and leave the rest to US""
But I can't... I won't be one that feeds an unknown God
Show to mankind that You really exist
And then explain to us the meaning of chaos

Give us reason to persist, to go on living through this Hell on Earth
All I want is peace of mind from all you non existing Gods
I bet that not even You will ever understand the truth
Cause YOU are nothing but a puppet on even higher strings

Your unholy eyes, I want to sew them shut
Oh you meaningless little God, and so I choose death over you
Up up the grey cold stairs, up into the tower of Hell
With a rope in my hand, I'm searching for the unknown land

King Diamond,"I'd been riding hard most of the night, wooded ravines on a mountain side
My horse was getting tired, and so was I
Up there the moon was full, down here darkness ruled
The trees were so much higher than they were meant to

In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes
I used to know this road so well, many a time i was here before

But now it seemed so different, the road was no more
I was lost, I stopped and looked around
I had this eerie feeling, that I was being watched
In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""

I knew I was not alone, and it wasn't not that crazy moon above
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes
Watching me
The trees have eyes, watching me

Then the sound I didn't want to hear, howling at the moon
Eyes I didn't want to see, I should have turned around
So much louder, the howling was chilling my bones
One wolf grown to a dozen, and here I was alone

Yellow eyes, they were everywhere, yellow eyes, as I prepared to die
Suddenly there she was, in a halo of light
Suddenly there she was, silvery black and white
The bluest magical eyes staring right into mine

Never ever had I seen in a wolf, such a beautiful beast
In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes",The Trees Have Eyes
King Diamond,"Upon the Cross he did not die, they tortured him, but he survived
Smuggled across the open sea, to Southern France, tranquility
There he married Magdalene, and founded another dynasty

King Diamond,"The storm was gone, but dark clouds still hung around
The perfect setting for things to come, late afternoon
She was still in bed after her visit to the crypt
Someone was calling Henry's name
Or was it only in her dream?

A dream of breaking glass, glass cutting into flesh
Rain turning red, blood running for the dead

Again she heard a name... it was louder, but the same

Jonathan was fighting his way out of bed

""Where is Brandon Henry and why is he late?""

""He didn't feel very well today

So I sent him back to bed and there he'll stay
But I, my dear, will cater to your needs
For you I will be the hand, the hand that feeds""

Abigail obsessed with her revenge
Her old spirit was back
It made her remember her dream of broken glass
""Use it in your scheme, the broken glass""

Broken glass crushed into sugar glace
Making dinner for Jonathan, Abigail was having fun
Would it be romantic dinner or slaughter of the lamb?
Would broken glass be cutting deep, deep into the flesh of a man?

Dinner was enjoyed by candlelight
And Jonathan was wearing his
Funeral suit, it put him in the right mood
Whatever it took, he would do

He was in love... he was in love again
He was in love... he was in love again
But Abigail would soon feed his love away

King Diamond,"The moon is outside but it can't get in
Almost dead from his nightly sin
Jonathan is deep asleep, a perfect time to visit the heap

Down the hallway to the lair, down down the slippery stairs
Abigail is in the crypt, a lantern in her hand

The secret of the crypt
A coghing made for a child, wondering who is inside
Oh Abigail and off comes the lid

The smell is sick
Mummified in front on its side
A name was cut deep in the lid with a knife
And it said: Abigail

A silvery necklace was round the mummy's neck
It had wings and was sharpened round the edge
""What are you doing here"", Henry had come in unseen

Abigail pulled on the necklace and the little mummy's head
Was separated clean from it's tiny neck
Then up up up, up into his throat
Twisting and turning it, oh she couldn't stop

Brandon Henry was going down in a pool of blood
He was on the ground

There's an eerie glow in the crypt down below
Mummified infant on its side
""Gotta go, gotta run, I'll be back for you little one""

In the crypt Abigail's twin is searching for a home
Abigail's twin is searching for her Mom

Will she ever know",The Crypt
King Diamond,"""Mommy... mommy... mommy... mommy""

Later that Night in her Room, Abigail was drifting off to sleep.
All of what she had seen Today, was hard to believe.

Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy
And that's a shame

Abigail was quickly on her feet
Down the stairs and into the dark, Abigail was following the sound
And there she was: the child

It was clearly a ghost, the ghost from the gate in the storm
""Little girl, tell me who you are?""
""I am your spirit twin from years ago, I'm little one""

That brought back memories of Abigail when turning six
Sneaking out of bed, like she always did

Hiding in the dark, listening to the men
Tell their stories from way back then
She remembered the story of Jonathan

And they'd been talking about the Little One

Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy
And that's a shame

And Abigail was sure to die

Suddenly the door was open, Where have you been my dear?
I'm Brandon Henry and I serve the master here

Through a maze of gloomy hallways and candles black
Safe from the storm she followed the man with the shaven head
They went into a room that was like a shrine
Jewellry and dresses too in cabinets made of glass
Portraits on the walls, 18 in all
A strong scent of old perfume, and then there was THE HAIR

Long black lifeless hair",Mansion in Sorrow
King Diamond,"Curtains of back were inside the room
Shutting out the light, the light that always hurt his eyes
There was nothing bright in this entire mansion... no, no
Except for the candlelight... the light... and the fire that burned real slow

Oh Miriam... why did you have to go and die?

Curtains of black were inside the room
Abigail was not alone, there was someone else in here too
""Come closer dear"", said the shadow in the wheelchair
""Stand by the fireplace, so I can better see your face""

Oh Miriam, why did you have to go and die?

[Solo: Andy]

The shadow could not believe, the likeness in her face
It looked as if his Miriam had come back from the grave
""I am Count de La Fey, and you are?""
""Abigail"", she whispered and shivered to the bone
""Can I?"", he said ""Can I,.. can I call you Miriam?""

""Miriam... or Abigail is fine
You can even call me Lucy for it is just a name""

He struggled out of the wheelchair
Since his fall many years ago
Now he could only walk by a cane, what a shame

[Solo: Andy]

""Don't move! Stay where you are"", and then he was right behind her
Touching her long black hair, he was breathing much harder now
Then he grabbed her head

In the pain she screamed as he
Yanked out a lock of that beautiful hair, oh dear oh dear oh dear

He quickly struggled across the floor to a smaller cabinet
Behind glass door it said: ""To My beloved Dear""
It was then he started to compare, and she saw the other HAIR
In his twisted mind, she was back, but why
""I must retire my dear in order to prepare
You should do the same, tomorrow an heir""",Miriam
King Diamond,"You could see the fire burn, you could see the colours turn
From black to no return
The night began to cry, rain from the sky
As the mansion died

Oh no... it died... oh no... it died
Deep down below, fire would not go
The crypt is still alive, listen to the child that cries

I wonder what is wrong
It's so damp... and cold... in here, could this be the home of fear
There's something in the dark, that should be left alone
As if it had a grave of it's own

[Solo: Mike]

There's a body on the floor, I hope there is no more
I think I'm stepping in blood
Too dark for me to see, a dark you only feel
Dark that always must be

I see a child... now I'm blind... where did she go? Oh no
Deep down below, fire would not go
The crypt is still alive, listen to the child that cries

Where did she go? She must have slipped into the dark again
Not too far away, I see a light
And there is Little One, standing by the wall
The lantern in her hand is lighting up the coffin on the stand

I used to know your sister, your eternal spirit twin
Oh but Abigail was way too busy with revenge
And now you're stuck in here on your own

King Diamond,"""Wake up Abigail"", midday, Henry was at her door
The Count would not rise 'til the afternoon and lunch was for two
So they talked about Miriam and then Abigail said:
""What about Little One?""
Henry froze: ""Oh, you mean our ghost?""

""Downstairs on the lowest floor
That's where you will find THE DOOR

When night time came on the second day and dinner it was done
Jonathan's headache it was gone
""Miriam please take my hand"", then his mood really changed
""Time is right to produce an heir""

Playing along with his eerie game she followed him up the stairs
Up to a room where love they would share
To a room that smelled as if Miriam was still in there

Jonathan was a hideous sight
So Abigail she hilled the candlelight
What was to come, should have never been done
She was blocking her mind from his awful thing
In her mind his moaning became
Nothing but falling on slippery stairs
Falling and crying, crawling and dying
At the end of the stairs

Her eyes turned black in disgust
Hating him more with every thrust
And then it was over before it begun

Abigail was walking in the forest where
The darkness, it seems to be alive

It was hours ago that she left her home

And now in the darkest night a storm was born

King Diamond,"Midnight, I see the snow that's falling
Midnight, still hanging on this wall

I'm thinking back in time
To when there was still a life
Free of misery
Oh, but it was never to be

King Diamond,"I stumbled out of Grandma's room,
Down the stairs and out of the house
Once outside I felt My mind begin to
Fight a battle for control

With the tea pot broken I kind of
Realized
That ""THEIR"" power was less here,
Here on the outside

I fell to my knees in haziness
And I looked in through the window
To the cellar

Things were moving down there,
""THEY"" were searching for something
And ""THEY"" really found it,
The big axe was flying

Flying out through the cellar door
Up the stairs to the kitchen...
Then I passed out

The next thing I remember seeing was
The smoke coming from the chimney
I soon realized the smoke I saw was
Actually... Oh No!
All there was left of Missy and her
Dress, poor little girl

The spell was broken, I really felt the
Change
As my mind and body became one
Again

The moon was alive with its silvery
Eye
Staring right into My evil heart

I went back to see if My Grandma'
Was still there
Waiting for me in the attic

King Diamond,"Tea time Monday night, I was waiting
passing time
Then from the hallway, I saw Mother
in her nightgown
Swaying up the stairs, up the stairs, it
seemed so unreal
I knew Grandma' had sent ""THEM""
again, the invisible friends

A little later in the middle of tea we
came close to ecstasy
""THEY"" were telling tales from
beyond when Grandma' rose

She opened the door, and there was
Missy
Seeing Mother in Grandmother's
chair, she went into tears

Missy was screaming
""What have You done, what have you
done to My Ma"", crying louder now
""We better get rid of her, She's too
young anyway"", it was Grandma' who
spoke

""Bye, bye Missy, be gone forever
The beautiful fireplace in the kitchen
will do""

I saw Missy struggling in Grandma'
wrinkled hands
""Oh No, let me be, Oh No Please No
Grandma' Please
Aagh Grandma' You're hurting me.
Don't touch me or I'll break it, I've got
the tea pot, I'll do it anyway""
I saw liquid spreading, the bloody tea
all over the floor
Now I heard ""THEIR"" voices, some
kind of demon growls
DIE - SHE BROKE AMON - AMON - DIE

""THEY"" dropped ""THEIR"" tea cups,
Grandma' stood still
forced by invisible hands, Missy went
down the stairs
As I waved her goodbye, Missy was
sobbing away

You from the window. Now come
inside My dear. It's good to see You
again, despite what You did to MY

on Grandpa's lap. I bet You're dying for
a cup of tea.""

To whom it may concern.

I am scared to death. 9 years ago they finally let me out, and I
was just beginning to feel better. I am not Myself any longer.
I guess You could not even recognize My face if You saw Me now.
That phone call 2 hours ago has torn Me apart. It was Grandma.
She invited Me back to the old house. I do not want to go back,
but I must. Maybe You will understand My fear if I tell
You what happened during My childhood.

18 years ago I was living with My mother and
My sister Missy in Grandma's old house. I had
been told that Grandma was away on a long vacation,
and that she would soon return. She did.

I have later found out that she was actually being released
from that same asylum. ""She's insane"", they said, when she
kept on babbling about ""THEM"". I still cannot make up
My mind about who really did separate Grandpa's head
from his shoulders. You see, ""THEY"" were always so
nice to Me.

Anyway, time is short and I must leave for the old
house. So here is what happened 18 years ago. And
in case we never see each other again, at least You
will know why.

I bet we are going to have tea.",Coming Home
King Diamond,"Tonight would be the last night that we had our tea
That bloody tea, which sent us into ecstasy
Yesterday Mother complained, feeling dizzy, all in pain

Mother's getting weaker, looking paler day by day

As morning came, she could not make it out of bed
And Grandma's spell was getting straight into her head
Not a single word, she didn't seem to be alive

Getting weaker, looking paler day by day

Then Missy came in and she led me by the hand
I didn't want to go, Oh but I should have known
Mother was barely conscious, why should I care
Just looking forward to the next ordeal

I think I heard My sister begging me to stay
She gave me the phone, so I could call someone for help
I simply let go of her hand, then I cut the wire

Missy was crying as I left them both behind
And Mother's getting weaker, Missy shouted at 
My back ""I hate you""",Mother's Getting Weaker
King Diamond,"Look, the old bitch is back, yeah,
Finally we'll get some company again
The attic room has been
Locked up for far too long, just like the
Old bitch herself, she's on time
Though, why that silly wheelchair?
Oh she's pretending as always, but
She does make a good cup of tea.

""Oh My God she's here. 
Missy, listen to what Mother says: 
Now you be good to Grandma; and remember
She's been away on a long vacation.
That goes for you too King. 
And stop playing that thing. Answer the door""",Out from the Asylum
King Diamond,"Morning came and so did they, flying
Questions from the police

Dr. landau
To return and tell me why they're
Taking me so far away

'Cause I could have been the...
I could have been the next in line""

Nobody found a trace of missy
I'd be the last to tell them anyway
How could I ever ever explain

Now I hear ""them"" again, singing

I hear ""them"" again, singing

Blood still running from my open

I hear ""them"" again, singing

Dr. landau returned, and I told him the
Story
""Are you mad or just insane?""
I tried anyway
""You can take him away now, the boy
Has lost his mind""
Oh no no

I haven't seen my mother since they
Took me away
And dr. landau wouldn't tell me
He wouldn't tell me anything

""Ah!""",The Final Hour
King Geedorah,"Render unto Geedorah what is Geedorah's
Tend to when he seizure through a beaker and a tweezers
Read the fine print and be like, ""What's the big deal?""
Spun wheels-of-steel since broke wheel Big Wheel
Back when it was greasy S-curl, now it's easy dread
Had a rhyme on how they used to tease him 'bout his peasy head
Yes-yes-y'all to the beat, have a ball or Avacore
Have it your way, grab his straw, Jabberjaw
Since two tone Lee's, these new phonies is boney hoes

Lonely like cheese and baloney only
I could've broke my ""sacro-philly-ac"" (sacroiliac)
Silly grind, Billy Jack, illy nine milli black
Listen to it go ""bang!"" Through and through a Kangol
A strange combination of a king who use slang flow
Two-thirds slow, one-third amazing
Wonder words, fine sponsor of this Thunderbird occasion
And have an iller rhyme, at least by Miller Time
Collect the skrilla and geese with a killer dime
Met her out in Killa Queens, originally she from the Philippines
I love the way she fill her jeans
Still a teen, and made for strange bedfellows
Okay, so it's head to elbows for shell-toes
Uh-oh, heads up! There she blows
A whole load of Head & Shoulders, and who care where she goes
Let the music take control
Just don't let the evildoers abuse it and use it to take your soul
It's like putting fire to fake gold, it turn colors

And get duller than a bake roll with no butter

The shutter of a cake hole
Who break drakes 'til it get old and flake mold
Cornball, have 'em seeing white stars, I warned y'all
Like getting hit with a bottle of Mo' from Sean Paul
(He not white) ... Oh, he mad light though
Either which way, they not ready for the lightning show
And can't scandalize mine
You could ask a swine who can't stands when I shine
Geedorah the professor, add a question to the lessons
He suggest you get a full assessment instead of guessing
It's too stressing, did he stutter like rookie yes-men?
Or did he just bring the butter, like the cookie chessmen
This just in: they ain't even worth the worry

Lying on their first birth and couldn't even hurt a Smurfberry

Hear ye, hear ye! How dare ye
Go up against the king who do his thing tri-yearly?
They're too carefree with their mouths around here
Off with his head, and display it at Town Square
On top a seven-feet spike, make sure it's on tight
In light of when the peasants throw stones with all their might
Skull get smashed for weeks
'Til vulture beaks eats the last meat off your cheeks
Maybe then they'll know the right words to speak
Out loud, at home, in the world, or in the streets
It's no escape, just in case
All the kings' mens and 'em decides to go apes
The most slick-talking of burly guys
Get caught and boiled in oil like curly fries
Even those that's Mr. Furley's size that earned the fate

Could all get burned at the stake
Send word to his closest kins, that for his sins
We claim his throne, his providence, and its citizens
In the name of King Geedorah! ...

Don't make him catch a seizure ...",The Fine Print
King Geedorah,"That's right I got problems and personal issues
Stories that'll make ya, eyes tear and wet tissue
It's true, I'm Madd like the Rapper
I'm so upset I gotta put it up in my rap before I snapper

After the things I've seen from Atlanta to Queens
To the mean streets of Brooklyn when I was a teen
Back and forth to the Islands, scream when I left
But adapted, and still my dreams haven't left

I only hung with the crack kids we not the best
Me and the ruffest ruffnecks went chest to chest
Now my best friend's locked up north I won't rest
'Til I let him live his dream threw me and I confess

That even though both our hearts was dark his was darker
Best believe when shit got spark he was the sparker
And when the block got hot he was the fire starter
And if I had beef my nigga Roger was a martyr

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Yo, you one of the most important people in my life
They called you Dice but I called you cousin
We was buggin' 'cause I figured that we both had something in common
You loved to chat reggae music and I loved rhymin'

But still they ain't call you Dice for nuttin'
I seen you shoot with the wiliest cats and leave them with nothing
Somethin' must have pleased that bluffer in you
To make you wanna take dough from those tougher than you

Threw out school we made money together
When you was on the floor shootin', I was the side better
And yo we cleaned out them cats and took the scraps
But you wasn't a ruff cat and cats knew that

I knew eventually them thugs would try to hurt you
If I was there, I'd never let nobody hurt you, it's hurtful
I knew they wouldn't let you take the money and run
That's why I shoulda came when you told me to come

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, how certain things don't go right
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Yo, it was June sixth '96, graduation night
Made it threw the school swish shootin' dice gettin' in fights
I even sparked a riot, 'til the school got quiet
And dismiss just got tired of usin' my fists

We had some shit like knife pipes bottles and sticks
Can't forget them 380's, nine's and 22's
Best believe, many dudes was paid in my crew
We made a name for ourselves boy I've seen some drama

Seems my momma never dreamed she'd go threw so much trauma
Comma, pause you ask about cops and laws
Well that shit don't exist when you black and poor
So we broke 'em, but at that night my heart got broken

Choken on the weed smoke drinkin' rum and gettin' open
Not to mention, never a big drinker I'm a thinker
But I'm thinkin' hey dis my night, pass me more liquor
Fight breaks out, I'm just too nice to get in it

But my brother got stabbed and I missed it
Word up, its crazy
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey
(Wonder)

I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
I wonder, why certain people come in my life
I wonder, yeah
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights

Hey, why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Before I rock raps, I drink a keg of Listerine
Then I spit the freshest lines you'll ever hear for centuries
Then I form blazing sword and cut your mic cords
And kill them garbage rhymes only your friends get hyped for
Blitz your whole team, them niggaz need to come clean
So I give 'em an acid wash like old school Levi jeans
(Lockjaw!) Crackin your faulty frame
And I bring the house down without hijackin planes
Locked stocked with two smokin barrels and will use it
To fuck up more beats per minute than drum'n'bass music
Trunks ain't a rapper, he's a monster from the future
Twistin your body in more positions than Kama Sutra
Smart-ass, gettin the Last Word with Jim Jome
With a right hand like Dr. Claw that's known for breakin bones

Yo, it's King Gheedra, combined with the forces of nine ether
Blowing woofers and tweeters, shaking syllable meaning
Disaster's cataclysmic, mystic natural, it's about time
We hit you with some substance that's actual

I got a gift call, hip-hop prophecy, says 2003
Ends the reign of the jiggy MC
No more roaming on this planet like scavengers
Sciences broke the code of the Gregorian calendar

Define laws and space in time, trying to trace my lines
Hold up, respect the architect
Digital rollin', my whole crew roll with VS
Type to master this whole universe in three steps

We stretch across the equator with something major
Universal rhyme tones, tamper with ya time zone
Minds blown by the millions jus' for the feeling
Hip-hop, it just don't stop until I make a killing

Nah, I'm kidding, but for real, the world ain't the same no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Word up, word up

Well, I'm colliding with the mind of a survivor
Surviving, uncover the time brother
The high volume white collar high styling
Verge jocking the side, dodgin' mirages

Conquer the vibe, hunger lurks
Nine to five work saga, God bless the life
Father trife, crawl for the light, pounding the globe on sight
Vocal pimpin', it's throat

So you know how we go down yo
Struck from the ghetto yo, medal throw
Settle the dough, live showbiz
The cannonball, weapon, men and arms

Four section, super intelligence, balance
Benevolent, stinging nettle medicine
Crouch tiger, dragon, craftmatic
Watch ya back, if, catch this

Fascist through the atlas, first class diplomatic status
Stagma flag, overstanding the plan
Bar skin, then a [unverified] streets watch timex clocks
[Unverified] punchless [unverified] on the dot five

Minutes to rot
So we blew blocks, crews
It's old news how we do

I'm a drop one rhyme
For every time, I cross the thin line
Between yours and mine, see, it's part of my design, shifting paradigm
Yin and yang combined, must be out ya mind

Thinking star would never shine
Pops duke, focus with a hawk's eye view
I'm all that, a plaintain, and some Ital stew
Gettin' spine ache, British, ATL upon this

Even avitronic figures be thumpin' off over this verbal elixir
Magnetic attraction, raw, nearly Jacksons
Straight open in the caption, here comes the Hix and Braxton's
Lyrical contraction, delivery reaction, it started with a passion

That's just the way it had been, raw with umbilical cords strapped
A corpse, won't drop a curse, while mustard hit this spouse?
Sharp with a needle, try to reach the people
Ya'll fiending for the sequel and the beat's not even EQ'd

King Geedorah,"Ghidra has arrived, you guys could take five
By the time it's over, no snakes alive
Take the dive, I'm tellin' you, you better off
Then up against a flow to make her, take her sweater off

From the set off when it came to scripts he could hardly brag
It's the result of concentration and lolly-gag
I said, ""Yeah right"" he pulled the mic out a snotty rag
Sealed up air-tight and wrapped up in a body bag

Get a advance and catch chance writer's block
After spendin' the first and last penny
My own worst enemy tell me if I'm OD and usual flow
And made deals with these cats who keep sending dough, so

The Three Headed said it, never get busted
He's a man of his word who's not to be trusted
Beats encrypted, multi-faceted encrusted
Shorty pawn, keep mic rusted

Sort of mellow type of fellow
Who sometimes spaz on wife like Othello
Hell no he won't use words like illuminati
Or Gotti all shotty might use karate

Azar the Gaza cut I'll ask why a mask
With the gall style caps say nice fly
Exact dough till it stack high, white ho, black
Guy the rap game, black eye

Exhiliration, Jet Jag's accelerations
Touch speeds minds can't concieve
Achieve altered, attitudes and angles, angels answer
Aura, illumilation, awesome interperation

Awkward alarm, ankle house arrest and who's best?
Monster Island Czars crush pawn dreams to be king
A frank reality calculation could never be
Quest destined, distant competition dusted

Disgusted raise for second, crowded
Clouded confusion, conclusion simple, plain
Self education, self made millionaires
Serpents slitherin', sidewind searchin'

Stalkin', heat sensin' can't have me Jet Jag's riki tiki tavi
Superhero hit zero to sixty hot pursuit, pedal to the floor
Handlin' lyrics, traction swervin' left right makin' head fix
Layin' high stakes levitates, quick hit breaks
They fly past hit war parts fly loose, kill a mongoose

Fake niggaz contiue to practice the art of intimidation
Sterile minds concieve and threw up all artificial insemination
Syntax a sequential rage unless it's all deliberate
Angle wide words clear, but population stay illiterate

Consider it God's a fine power, fools get rid of it
Men build dreams on promises but lacken' the will to deliver it
You, I disolve connivers like saliva on tic tacs
World is strange, but get the job done like sises mix max

Flip tracks, murder stinks, drunk niggaz killin' six packs
Chokin' on venom, suffered tricknological kick backs
Poverty stricken' minds, all thoughts barely worth two cents
Build history through time, many a design on blueprints

Anooshes slides in the sky, eight-five percent never knew
Wise men arise, pull files like internal revenue
Forever true, appauled? There's self evidence with leverage
Upset? The beast belly concoct

Homogenised beverage
Clever shit, calculate a sabatoge trojan horse
Gift from? See through any G motion that grows in force
Chose to toss to teach familiar line throughout the underworld

God of elevation kills Superman, rape Wondergirl
The discounted, decapitated rapist it's acceptable
The everyday occurrence a fatal outcome's inevitable

Might as well join the forces boss
Chance take a loss like coin toss
Roll with the double headed nickel
Pawn the pawn a Jet Jag with the sickle you and a pickle

King Ghidra yo you ass betta leave 'em alone
Before ya go catch a seizure and leave 'em blown
If you ain't the best of the best in the top three

Either myself, I and me don't even think of caps
But act like you had a slight inkling perhaps
Or get smacked back in the ring like Bob Backlund
Ink jet black and wack

Shut up ha ha ha, young man

They're sittin' down by a river in the swamps
They're sitting on a log
One of them is kind of a big fellow
And the other one is a little bit smaller and he's got a long-billed cap
And they're sittin' there ponderin' on what they're gonna do for the night
And anything the big guy decides on the little guy's for
Cause he digs him, he's cool
So it's called Roosevelt and Ira Lee

The river was dark and muddy
And the moon was on the rise
And all of the creatures in the swampland
Had woke up to feed for the night
Roosevelt and Ira Lee were sittin' there on a log
Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt and said
I'd sure like to have a mess of bull frog
He said: Yeah yeah lawd sure would taste good

So they slipped on their rubber boots
And walked down to the water edge
And right away they knew that the night would be a bummer
Cause Ira Lee stepped on a water mossacin Ugh! Ugh! Lawd
""Somebody help me !""

Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt when he quit his screamin' and kickin'
And he said, ""Let's forget about those bullfrog legs

That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind",Always on My Mind (Matteo d'Amato Remix)
King Just,"[Intro]
Hell yeah
This is how we supposed to do
Uh-huh, Black Fist we gon' do?

[Chorus]
Drop the grenade, niggas ain't larger
Time to get paid, you're in the alarm
Rappers get slayed, and they cause no harm
I'm about to lay, hey, can I get some?

[King Just]
Yo, come get a fuckin taste of reality
Casualty, wept over the whole fuckin galaxy
Battle me, your styles a game like Sorry
Or like Atari, I'm gnarly just like a Harley
Davidson, I take on the bravest one
And turn into that bitch ass nigga he was
'cause, ain't no fakin and no playin
And every word that I say, is every word that I'm slayin
Oh God, why do they think I'm broad
Is it my lyrics is hard or is I'm wit the Mob
From the Six, now all these rappers talkin shit
But I must be schemin on my life to make hits
Black Fist on the rise, oh now you're surprised
Ya niggas don't exist, like fuckin pens you pry
But I'mma ride, this beat like girls ridin my meat
Fuckin wit Just, that's like swimmin in Shit's Creak
Wit diarrhea, oh mamma mia
Skills is ill, real faster than a cheetah
In a jungle, and I'mma watch ya empire crumble
If rap was football, ya niggas would of been fumble

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Back up, back up, yes Zoo's in town
Wit the new twist and a brand new sound
What you want? Ya niggas ain't ready for war
'cause it take ten more, before I get raw
Hardcore, off the wall hip hop
Nonstop, settin up shop on your block
Wit glocks, let ya brain rot
Mob tactics, bustin shots, there's a freeze on the pop
What blood clot? Means no money, no honey
And that's what make us better than you dummies
Sayin all types of shit like Shaolin wouldn't last
But just like an automobile you been gassed
Passed, just like the rest, you want to come for test
My brain's half rhyme, the other half cess
I've been blessed wit the success
What did you except? Look at the way I catch wet
From the projects, and I'mma live here
Til I die, gettin high, Shaolin Soldiers take over in '95
And I'mma make sure all my shit is raw
For ya niggas who front, spell it backwards, war

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Hey good lookin, what you got cookin
Pack your nerve quick, I have this in the street shookin
The fucked up, niggas better duck
Somebody call a bomb squad, 'cause I'm about to blow up
Boom, there goes the building
The bomb makes a killa stackin loot to the ceiling
Who dwellin and dealin, maybe I got the fuckin feelin
That I'mma make platinum, I gots to see the million
I'm destined to buck fuckin wild just like a Western
They goin two in the quarter, and have mad sessions
Ain't no second guessin, I'm back, where's ya heart at?
Shaolin's on the map, Zoo niggas attack
The track, got my mind flippin a hundred miles a minute
And as long as I'm in it, boy, I'mma finish
A M.C. off, they got lost and tossed by the source
'cause I pay the cost to be the boss
You get flagged like Betty Ross and the Spangled Banner
Slammin shit more harder than fuckin Thor's hammer
The ill manner, wit ill grammar
When I get mad, I turn the opposite of fuckin David Bammer
The incredible, unedible, turn backwards
Terrible, cock a phony rappers offa pedestal

Yeah, how we on that Shaolin Soldier shit

The way they smell and the things in their purse

I just want to say what you want me to

oh, take me. take me back
Take me back to virginia,

Sleep to the music of the ice cream man
And rest my head
If I wake up on the right side

A song for my people from yesterday

Dancing to the music
As she sings out to me
Smiling and laughing as the people dance my soul
Take me back to virginia

And several desires to pursue

To cause the tide

Reach slow motion to con the mind

To where my senses left
And rain had turn my sense to mush
This slowly seeping straight through the crust
Now let these stains of gunk slip down
To where my head once sunk and drowned
Just await for a while to see
My body has merged to the deep cruel sea

But my soul floats
Adrift thoughtless minds, distorted lines
The soul is broken down, border lines
To cause the tide, to enforce divide

King Kukulele and the Friki Tikis,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas

Cause daddy never had his back
Always talkin bout how his mama front now that's played out
You are who you're made of, all make-up don't make out

And medicine isn't healing but a hug is
And smiles don't last forever but forever is

She said put this ten in church and pray for better then before
Oh my God

I said God, save us, money, slave us
War, left bodies on the floor, good gracious
I said God, save us, money, slave us

So I'm never second, never second guess me on the second hand
Every second count
Cause if I'm second than that's still a blessing
Cause you took a second just to check me out
Could a check me out, I mean out for real
We need family time, we got a house to build
I mean why they tryna take the house from Bill
Now we need a doctor and a house for real
Dear Mr. President, if you're hesitant
Your presence is requested in the mist of neglagence
To fix your residence
It's a message in our restlessness
Tryna wrestle with being the lesser of
Whatever the lesser get
If it's a lesson it's really stressin it's really stretchin it
We finna burn this bitch down if you really question it
Allow me to define the depths of something so definite
Death ain't just a step to you motherfucker's just steppin it

Might sound crazy but just maybe your protection on this earth

Whatever people had we didn't even have half it
I had to have passion and never had fashion
It's hard to have class when it's half assed backwards

You remind me of dancers cause you so well balanced, the world's spinning

I'm begging you for a second just free my body I'm sore
I'm soaring, I'm sorry, you saw me leaving out of the door
But when odds ain't even how evened out is the score
We remind me of missing space
Too much distance placed between hugs and kissing face
Yeah we remind me of failed cries
But what is pain, to wooden brains and nailed eyes
Earning love is learning losses
How could you plant seed and not return for harvest
We are missing concerning fathers
And that reminds me of burning crosses
Turning nauseous cause you remind me of me
Except I'm the new design, what are you designed to believe
Just tell me you're gonna stay, build a stage and perform
Take me by the hand when I'm lost and tell me a poem
Yeah tell me that story about the storm like how it rains

Fuck a school, and the teacher too, they don't teach the truth

All my niggas hug the strip and all my bitches love to strip
So suck a dick, I got kids, and a baby mama too
Yeah she work my fucking nerves like a baby mama do

I can scream, cause you just smile like everything is fine
Hope is fun, when I grab my gun, come take dear life or mine
Suicide, yeah it's suicide, life is suicide
Fuck your right or wrong, the shit that I been on is do or die
If I do I die, if I don't I die that's suicide

It whole heartedly been a part of me in my own thought
Process so I digest through my own art
That I'm blessed though I digress due to slow starts
But who else could bring the hood out
And tell 'em when they let God in, it brings the good out
Learn a lesson and listen, my current composition concerns your present condition
And turn direction envision of givin' blessings and wishin' you well
Well wishing and tales fishing
Siftin' through hell's kitchen to find good
Have a God-like mind as the divine should
Define good within yourself I think the time's good
And may these lines live forever like a line should
It's a war going on and your soul fighting
So frightening within you I see thunder and both lightening
Boat striking, snow ice and hail
Your whole life unfold like, cold nights in Hell
In a mode like, you're feeling low like, like you don't like yourself
You got no sight, no insight, no foresight, that's the shit that your foes like
Run up on a nigga get 'em froze like
Put the 4-4 to his foes like
Niggas 'bout to take a pic, trying to get the pose right
Red dot, headshot, hit 'em close like
Like, like all theses niggas I've got to shoot one
Fuck one, plus I'm cocking two guns
Fuck shoe money, I'm coppin' coupes son
No y'all niggas not 'bout to do none
Guns, that's a way of life, get money not God
You got guns, we got bigger guns, go get one and I ride
If I die, they say I went hard, I go super hard
Bitch you with this shits or not? We gon' get this loot or starve?
Fuck you doing? Writin' in a pad, fuck you making songs
What you rappin', boy you know what's happ'nin', that shit take too long
Fuck you mean? Get this fucking cream, get this fucking cream
Hug this block, tote this fucking Glock, can't let these suckers scheme
Shit too real, shit too fucking real, I'm too real to dream
So when it's this cold world won't feel a thing

Lonely days are gone
All them nights to come
Waited to be yours

King Missile,"I remember the last time I donated blood.
The nurse put a bandage on my arm and told me not to remove it for six hours.
The time was five o'clock, and
At about ten to six, 
I was having an early dinner with some friends
In a pretty nice restaurant.
I was embarrassed enough that I had short sleeves on;
The bandage made me look downright silly.
So I removed it slowly,
Surreptitiously,
So no one would see.
Suddenly,
A thin but powerful stream of blood started gushing out of my arm.
It hit a man sitting directly opposite from me,
Splashing off of his head and onto the floor.
A waiter,
Delivering a bowl of chicken noodle soup to a nearby table,
Slipped.
The bowl went flying and landed on my head.
I was completely covered with noodles and I disappeared.
Well, I learned my lesson that day.
And the next time I give blood,
I'll wear long sleeves
And I'll leave the bandage on.",The Blood Song

Doors of perception, windows of opportunity
These are illusions, like the killing floor."" 
Ed spoke in a squeaky whiny voice 
With perhaps a slight tinge of glee, 
But this was only because 
He couldn't be bothered to develop a manner of speaking 
That truly reflected his mood. 
""This is a vacuum. 
There is no air in this room. 
Despair is no fun anymore. 
Nihilism knocked three times on the ceiling, 
But the rosy fingers of dawn always inserted themselves
In the nose of unfulfilled promises. 
Angels sang ""Heysanna, Hosanna"". 
Paralyzed primadonnas danced in the streets all day
But when the darkness came, everybody went home. 
I was ready, everyone else was asleep. 
And while it may have been a relief to see that I was right all along, 
Here I am still, alone and trapped, awaiting the endless end.""
""And I can turn it all around, and laugh at it and laugh at myself 
I can laugh louder than the walls, the halls, the waterfalls, 
Louder than Charles de Gaulle or Fulton Mall, 
But I don't know what I'm laughing at. 
I don't know just what I think is so Goddamn funny. 
I don't know why I don't just shut up and give up and lay down and die. 
What do I have to complain about anyway?"" 
Ed asked his Picasso, ""I'm a millionaire!""
This wasn't actually true. 
Ed's Picasso was an obvious forgery, 
His three Rothko's had just been singled out 
In an article in ""Artforum"" entitled 
""The three most insignificant paintings of Mark Rothko"" 
And his Barbara Krueger's had been irreparably damaged 
By Rein Sanction and a few other bands from Gainsville 
That refused to acknowledge the value of art.

""Come to think of it,"" 
Ed mused to the laminated roadkill coffee table 
That he had purchased when times had seem slightly less bleak, 
""Come to think of it, not only does art have no intrinsic value, 
But my collection has no extrinsic value either. 
I know I'm not a millionaire, but that's no reason to complain. 
There is no reason to complain, there is no reason to do anything. 
I don't believe in reason, objective reality, or collective farming. 
I don't believe in public speaking, which is another reason why I'm here alone. 
I don't believe in life or death. 
I would kill myself, but I don't believe in suicide."" 
Ed put on a red shirt and took a quick walk around the block 
While whistling softly to himself. 
He reentered his apartment screaming. 
""There is no life on this planet! 
Jehovah-One replaced all life with machinery five centuries ago. 
The so-called industrial revolution was just another hoax 
And we all fell for it, 'cause we were all programmed to. 
Even I fell for it, I believe in the steam engine, 
Even though I don't believe in anything. 
Logical inconsistency is the Mr.Bubble I bathe in each and every evening, 
Except yesterday evening, when I roller bladed over to the masonic temple 
To play pinochle with Pope John Paul the First. 
I really had no choice in the matter."" 
Ed certainly could go on and on, 
And he did, and he would, and he will, 
Until you or I or somebody does something about it. 
Senator Sterno of Louisiana announced over closed circuit television. 
""And as long as he continues to pontificate pointlessly, I will do nothing."" 
Ed walked away from the program feeling fortified and stapled. 
His brain was buzzing, the way it always did after watching Jeopardy. 
He loaded up the micro bus with Atlases and Poseidon's and headed for Pope County.
""I've had it!"" he sang. 
""I've had it with puns, alliteration, Russian literature, 
Italian Neo-Realism, meaningless cross references and laundry lists of nonsense.
I shall drive without a license, without clothing, 
Without direction and if I make it to Arkansas fine, 
And if I'm running late, if I'm running a numbers game, it doesn't matter. 
I shall keep on running, yes, this is the answer. 
This is the ending. 
I shall keep running, because a body in motion tends to stay emotional, 
And its better to feel. 
Pain is better than emptiness, emptiness is better than nothing, 
And nothing is better than this.""",Ed

Personally, I'm more than a little disillusioned with castration. I've used it numerous times as a literary device, and it seems to have lost its punch. I'm sure it isn't the last taboo; no doubt there are endless avenues of violence and depravity for me to explore. I've done child molestation, president-fucking, golden showers – in fact, I believe I helped popularize the phrase ""I'd rather be pissed on than pissed off""! I've written about mass suicides, mass murders, and God help me, Christian masses. I have blasphemed heinously – although, I admit, not nearly as heinously as any major religion, try as I might. Some of the shit I've done with shit would make your shit turn green. I've played with and eaten my own vomit. I have fucked your father's corpse in every available orifice and have punched out a few new ones, and there's not a fucking thing you can do about it, and tomorrow I'll do it again. I've done bad things with relish, and good things with pickles. I regret nothing, I apologize for nothing – but it is all so appallingly pedestrian, and none of it thrills or shocks me anymore. It is so sad. So maybe I should just go back to the flowers and the bunnies and the sunshine and whatnot.",Ennui
King Missile,"Jim is a new character I just thought of today, but I warn you â?? don't get too used to him. Don't try to get to know him, don't try to like him, because I'm gonna kill him. That is what I do. I invent people, and then I kill them.

Jim walks with a limp, but don't worry about it. It doesn't matter that he does, and it doesn't matter why, because he's going to die.

Okay, he was bit by a dog last week, that's why he limps. Okay? And it wasn't his fault at all. Nor is it his fault that he will die. He will die because he had the poor sense to be invented by me. He doesn't deserve to die. He is a nice guy with a lot of friends, and he is helpful and reliable. A lot of people count on him, and they will be sad when he dies in a few moments. And it is too bad for those people. Some of these people will also die, because they count on Jim, and Jim is going to die, and Jim won't be there when they need him, and so they will die too. So it will be a shame for these people. People I also invented. People like Jane, who has no arms. People like Jack, who has lung cancer. People like John â?? not me, a different John â?? who is autistic. Jim is a friend to them all, and he helps them all in countless, invaluable ways. But it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I only bring these things and people up for only two reasons: so that as I write them down, I can think about exactly how Jim will die, and so that his meaningless death will have meaning.

Would you like to know what Jim does for a living? So would I, let's see. Jim is independently wealthy. He â?? he doesn't have to work, but he does anyway. He does volunteer work. He helps out at the cancer ward, and in the section of the hospital where the people who have no arms live. And on the weekends, he works with autistic children like John (not me).

Does Jim have a love life? No. He is too busy and too shy. Does Jim have any pets? No. Are Jim's parents still alive? Yes. It will be tragic for them when Jim dies, maybe of a brain hemorrhage, I haven't decided yet.

Okay, let's do it. This morning Jim was reading the paper. He was reading an article about the Congo, the country formerly known as Zaire, and he was drinking coffee and he spilled the coffee on himself, and it burned, it was very hot, and he jumped out of his chair, and he bumped his head on the wall somehow, and fell out of the window and landed on his bad leg, and limped into the street and got hit by an ambulance and left for dead, but he wasn't dead yet, he was just lying in the curb, and pigeons came along and ate his eyes, and seagulls ripped his stomach out, and pelicans ate his liver, and his spleen popped out all on its own and turned into a harmonica and played a pleasant little tune. Then out came his pancreas, which turned into the dog that bit him last week, and it bit him again and again and again many times.

Jim was writhing in agony, and just then Jack, Jane, and John (not me) walked by. But they didn't recognize him, so they did nothing. They could have saved him, but they were too distracted. They could have saved Jim, but they didn't; they left him dying there. So don't blame me, 'cause I wasn't even there. Jim was killed by his friends, really, because one of them stepped on his face as they walked by, and the other two kicked him â?? by accident, but still, they kicked him â?? one in an exposed part of his brain where a piece of his skull had come off, and the other in the testicles, which technically maybe wasn't a direct cause of death, but it sure didn't help matters any either. Jim recognized his friends, of course, but of course his throat was full of blood, and he was unable to call out their names. This made him unbearably, impossibly sad, and he lost the will to live, right then and there, and just right then, he died.

Did he choke to death on his own blood and vomit? Perhaps. Did he die from the loss of his internal organs? You could say that, maybe. Did he die from the kick in the brain, or from getting hit by the ambulance? Well, look. Causes of death, like meanings of life, are mysterious and ineffable. We can speculate for the rest of the evening if you like, and one can attribute Jim's death to any number of assorted factors, but as for me, I like to think he died of a broken heart.",Jim

My father died in the '80s, but in the '40s he was quite famous. He played in the Negro Leagues. He was the first white man to play in the Negro Leagues. I think originally he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but then they traded him to the Kansas City Monarchs in exchange for Jackie Robinson or something like that, I don't know. My father was a modest man, and he didn't like to brag about his accomplishments. And they were very great accomplishments.

For example, in 1965, he came to this country with just a few dollars and started the Hare Krishna religion. I still have a picture of him hanging out in Tompkins, showing the hippies how to chant and be happy. Also, my father was the first, and so far only, man to be born with Fallopian tubes. He had his nipple pierced, and his testicles, and his clitoris â?? he was really cool. He used to work for American Standard, the toilet people, and he did some mail drops for the CIA. He always used to say to me, ""Son, Lyndon Johnson has always been made out of clothespins, but Eisenhower was a cantaloupe and only now is he Episcopalian. Nothing short of sausages and funnels for as long as you both shall live."" He never explained this to me entirely. He never had to.

Speaking of testicles and clitori, about five years after he died, my father wrote a play, and the main characters were named Testicles and Clitorus.

Here is a brief excerpt:

(spoken, with Bradford as Clitorus and Sasha as Testicles)
Clitorus: Hey Testicles, how's it hangin'?
Testicles: Dude.
Clitorus: Dude.
Testicles: Dude, baby boomers suck. 'Cause they're old, and they don't give a fuck about AIDS research, 'cause they're all old and they don't have it, and they don't give a fuck if we all die.
Clitorus: Yeah, but dude, like, at least they support free cheese enemas for the poor.
Testicles: So dude, when are you gonna introduce me to Ella Fitzgerald's underwear and Jerry van Dyke's pancreatic fluids?
Clitorus: Well, dude, when are you gonna bake me that delicious blueberry fetus pie you've been promising me?

It was never produced, but Desi Arnaz bought the film rights for Paramount, and I put my share of the inheritance into mutual funds, which I parlayed into a sizable fortune, which I then spent on Q-tips and hydrogen peroxide for the Church of Hal, because I could never really get into my father's religion, dressing up in orange and jumping up and down and chanting all the time â??

I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.

Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

King Oliver,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

King Sun,"I make real fat tapes, and I like the sound
Sayin' lines from the mind, never writin' em down
Though a talent I have had for quite some time
Not everybody enjoys a good rhyme
I couldn't care less for anyone else
Put a rhyme on a tape and listen to it myself
If something is wrong, I gotta erase
I think of something much fatter, and then I replace
I see it as a deed, done for reward
My voice with a beat makes you want to record
King Sun with the sounds you could never escape
Every time you turn around, you hear another fat tape

I went downtown, to buy a fat box
Everything was included, so the tape could rock
Had dual cassette with the auto reverse
Made sure that I had the fat tape first
When I looked in my bag, cold had a fit
Couldn't find one tape with hardcore 
I was so upset, and ready to get ill
Then I thought about a kid who lived up the hill
I went to his house to get my tape
He was playin' the jams from the fire escape
I told him that I needed my tape today
He said to tell it to the people in the alleyway
Who are havin' a party, but it had to halt
Pass of my tape, and it ain't my fault
Went back for the box I came to get
Bought new batteries for the fat cassette
Godfather of Rock, the one with the box
Playin' 24 hours around my block
Some people okay, but I'm in good shape
It cost 5.99 for a fat tape

Bust the rhythm & blues, here's good news
For those of you that love the hip-hop
Continuous beats play through the streets
And the good news is that it will not stop
(Check this out)
It's contagious, like a bad disease
Attracts many people like a dog does fleas
Though it pumps as this party jumps for only 1 MC
I am the activator, sole creator
Down with the man who rocks the crossfader
Back and forth, to move south and north
And to increase at such a level, and I can go off
Slow or fast, yet to get faster
Capability equivalent to the masters
Knowledge known, wise words to be spoken
Record what I'm sayin' if your deck is not broken

Maestro, I conduct, make mega bucks
And this tape will certainly self-destruct
No mission's impossible, I'm unstoppable
Afford to record on tapes that are droppable
Various beats that rock the street
King Sun who you anticipated to meet
My tape will sore to unlimited heights
Contract of insurance in case you might bite
Put a tape in a box, start walkin' around
No need to rewind or turn the tape down
Turn it up past 10 and have no fear
You are playin' one of many fat jams to hear
In the winter or the summer, or any time
Nothin' is recorded over none of my rhyme
Soundwave static, no interference
People applaud by the sight of my appearance
No top hat, Tuxedo or cape
Just me on the m-I-see and a fat tape

Some tapes are heavy, and I mean fat
I record in a level above the hi-hat
Bass drum plants fear into your ear
With the help of the snare it will ruin your gear
Rippin' off your clothes from your head to your toes
Idolize the sound that many people have chose
Sound so live, you would think I'm in it
So much pleasure on a 60 minute
Cassette, to eject shows disrespect
Bustin' out a 90 minute full of hi-fi 
Technology induced, well givin' a boost
I get loose, and I do it for a musical use
Not done for the money, or to impress
I do it, because this is what I do best
King Sun is the one, fruitier than a grape
Everytime you turn around, you hear another fat tape

Bust the fat tape

Cause I can do a three year's bid with ease

Because I wasn't even caught by five-o
Now who would assume Sunborn is a rat?
The same one who said I wasn't right 'n exact

Now she knows everything that I don't even know
She gave me a list of every place we go
Together, I say 'whatever', it can't be denied
Just because I never told, doesn't mean I lied
Now I gotta 'fess up and tell the truth
She even knows about the phone calls at the phone booth
Damn, who's the little fork-tongued critter?
Who told her I knocked the boots of the baby sitter
She won't say who she heard quotin'
Just keep talkin' while my gun is bein' loaded
It might be a friend who's really a foe
But say no more, love, I think I know

It's goin' on and on, and not about to stop
Snakes are criminals, snakes are cops
Out even in the White House, without a doubt
Find a snake, and let's cast them out
Slippin', slidin', duckin', hidin'
Buy a new car and go snake-ridin'
I guess now you snakes are very angry

This is not a rhyme about the racial times
And if you don't want to hear it then pay it no mind
What I'm about to say may get you all upset
So I apologize and the wise don't sweat

Are too busy frontin' yo, tryin' to be fly though
You might hear this and think I'm trippin'
But knowledge the wisdom before you start flippin'
As modern day God, I do analysis
To find out what makes them hard like callouses
Instead of being sweat, truthful and soft
They want to be false and that turns me off

And your makeup is swine plus a big disguise
Your clothes are tight, I can see every inch
And then you wonder how I get this urge to pinch
Sellin' your sex, without makin' love

If I look fine, I get a one night slumber
Wham, bam, but no thank you ma'am
Want to knock the boots but you don't know who I am

If I screamed on ya daughter, pardon me mista
The point I'm makin', such a visual fact
Teach her to be original, and how to be black

Groove to this
Move to this

I know you're probably mad and would like to roast me
But get yourself together, before you approach me
'Cause I'm no sucka, I say what I feel
I might hurt your feelings, but at least I'm real
The way to be black is to strive for goals
You're no longer the people who was bought and sold
My advice to you is a word to the wise
Snap out of the negative, into the civilized
This place around you was meant to down you
Kings and Queens but yet they still won't crown

King Sun,"[ VERSE 1 ]
Once upon a time there was a big diesel kid
Who just got sprung from a 10 year bid
10 years is a long time, he left as a pup
But came out as an adult, about to act up
Out on the block he played the average street games
Gamblin, scramblin, just to build up a name
Pumped a few pockets, he got on the spot
Not until he bought a Benz did his name get hot
Out on the streets slingin big rocks on concrete
Those who tried to play him, they cold got beat
I mean cold, you dissed him and you just got smoked
Then he'd take your spot and leave your family broke
Even five-o was petro and wouldn't even act up
To give him a ticket, they'd have to call in for back-up
That's how extra and large the boy got
Just gettin started in the game of a big shot

	(Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie)

[ VERSE 2 ]
It only took two years for all of this to occur
He met a light-skinned squally and flipped over her
She was dope alright, but the girl was so young
Her eyes was so lovely that money was strung
This kid was 23 and the girl 16
See, another street king had now found his queen
And he was runnin things, puttin others in fear
Makin 20 g's a week, and that's a million a year
Steppin out to the club with his girl in a mink
Wearin custom-made jewels and big fat links
Go upstairs where his place would be set
With the choice of Dom Perrignon or Moët
Four soldiers undercover loungin with his brother
Everybody strapped with a vest and a rubber
Just in case somebody's girl got hot
But she was bagged and ragged in the club by a big shot

Extra large

[ VERSE 3 ]
Spots from the east to the westside he ran
If money was power, then this kid was He-Man
Never again would homeboy go thirsty
Cause he bought a mansion in Patterson New Jersey
The house that was owned by Lou Castello
At the age of 25 life was so mellow
A father of 4, each had different mothers
That's to my knowledge, might have had others
Nothin could go wrong, the world was his
Until one day somebody gave him a quiz
To see if he was thorough or just a front
A kid pulled out and got smoked like a blunt
The brother knew how to react on impact
Bust him in the shoulders, opened up his back
Three more to go, what was four deep
Who were sent on a mission to put him to sleep
He dipped in a Benz, bein pursued by a van
Picked up the cellular phone to call his man
They strapped up and loaded up in the trucks
With A.K.'s, nines and Uzis, ready to buck
Now homebody was doin like 100 quick
Down the block cold jettin and not sweatin conflict
Bullets were flyin from the van behind him
His boys were rollin, but they couldn't find him
The city was large, and they had to think fast
He had on a vest, but what if he crashed?
The brother made a right, and what happens then?
A big yellow sign that read 'dead end'
Now he could give his soul to the essence to keep
All of a sudden there were shots from a black jeep
It was his young girl who met him at the spot
Cause she was always taught first hand from a big shot

[ VERSE 4 ]
19 year old female was so bold
Her and the homegirls always had ammo
The brothers in the van just kept on firin
Deep in the background the sounds of sirens
The kid in the Benz, got out and got shot
Caught two in the leg, and the leg was real hot
He fell to the ground with no strength to run
The clip was empty in his automatic gun
The girl in the jeep had blocked off the street
Tryin to save a big shot from defeat
Crazy gunfire last for a while
But then came the trucks with the Bigfoot style
A.K.'s and Uzis weighed more than tons
Killed the three brothers that tried to run
The ones who lived were arrrested by the cops
But the charges were dropped, the judges were paid by big shots

[ VERSE 5 ]
Listen, it's not hard to take charge
Life of a big shot is extra large
Strictly do or die, makin moves direct
Cause a big shot will always get just due respect

Well, I don't know, cause they're afraid to meet me
Some try to greet me, and then try to diss me
Behind my back when their girls can't resist me
It's only right that I get my props
Cause I drop hip-hop freestyles non-stop

I know you don't want none

Cause you're soft
I knew you wasn't fit to take the hit
And this is only a little bit of some of the good shit
The rest is better, every word, phrase and letter
A sworn vendetta to all those who said a
Little too much and touched a nerve
The only thing you deserve is the justice I serve
Severely, and I make you pay dearly
Play me like a ( ? ) then I really
Come out to get you, find you and wet you
Met your girlfriend forget she met you
You against me, come on, that's a no-win
You must be drunk off Cisco and slow gin
When I'm fightin it's Clash of the Titan
Thunder and lightnin, you're frightened by what I'm writin
You wonder how come my records ain't sellin
Cause I won't sell out to the pit you fell in
I'm too wise like a bag of chips when I flip
You remember King Sun ""On the Club Tip""?
I still ""Heat Up"" ""Snakes"" till it's ""Time to Go""
""Coming Soon"" with another ""Fat Tape"", so
You're ""All In"", this is the end of you
""Hey Love"", you want to know ""Do I Love You""?

You soft shoe booty-ass punk muthafucka
Thought you were tough, then you cold ran out of luck
A minute ago I know you thought it was easy 
To diss me, but you missed me, and that didn't please me
A song and dance doesn't give you a chance to advance
I think you better go home and enhance
Your lyrical skills on the real, you can't swing
On the devine, be off mine, picture the King
Bein all up in the open, hopin you could step to
I be a monkey's uncle, and you're my nephew
Climbin on my back while I'm flowin with the tracks
Tryin to learn how to burn - this is what you lack
Air, gas and energy, greater than Con Edison
Fuel into infinity with pure solar medicine
I know what time it is, I clock it on the Sun dial
Chumps are beaten, tied up and dragged for miles
I'm so foul, that at times I'm bad news
Battle me and lose, you win a pair of shoes
Made of concrete, there's somethin sweet about that
To match your dead man suit and your dead man's hat
When it's right I deliver, at the bottom of the river
You'll be found, gagged and bound, with no liver
I fed it to a kid that always bit suckers
Soft shoe booty-ass punk muthafucka
Each and every line I design with precision
In the mind I'm inclined, appealin to your vision
On a physical basis - never the racist one
My mission is to see that competition is done
So I do em, throw em to the crowd
Make the crowd boo while I diss em out loud
Girls that want to battle, I serve em, then I screw em
Next time I see em, I don't say nothin to em
But then they want to sweat me, they can't get me
Keep your cool, you're a fool to upset me
Illegit, half-wit geek-ass nerd
(I heard the god can't rhyme) Yeah, fuck what you heard
You got nerve, you deserve to be stuffed in your mouth
Then you can pop shit while your teeth are fallin out
I throw joints to score points at war
Once more I make sure you leave through the door
On a stretcher, I betcha your concussions are rushin frequent
Blow for blow my k.o.'s have been a sequence
Step up of step off, the choice is yours
There's always room for one more on the floor
You lay down and stay down, until the full count to 10
Unanymous decision - I win
I know you wonder what part of the game is this
If you know like I know, it's the part you missed
Anybody coulda told you, I'm diesel like a truck to
A soft shoe booty-ass punk muthafucka
I was gonna let you slide, but I decided not to
Don't even try to run, cause I got you
Trapped like a rat, your tail bein squeezed
In the trap I set, caught you goin for the cheese
Sayin please doesn't mean you're released from the scene of the crime
Tryin to step to me with your bullshit rhymes
You practice in a daily rehearsal
I'm universal, dramatic or commercial
One thing to say about the King is worth big money
Dig, money, I master 120
Okay, you got a gun, now I'm supposed to be afraid?
You pull the trigger, I pull the pin to the grenade
If you catch me in a chest, bust, I'm in a vest
You'll be blown to the zone of your perpetual rest
Don't ever try to take me out the box again
Even on Fantasy Island - you're never gonna win
Your fans are all mislead, cause you're mentally dead
Count your heads, cause your boys just fled
They ran off and left you, played you like a sucker

Yo check it, there's a girl around my way
Don't ask for names, cause I won't say
She's a real pow-wow who likes to play
Nah, dukes, her name ain't Fay
This girl couldn't be 19 or more
Always waggin her tail and on all fours
Real big hips with legs so healty
I asked her who's her man, but she won't tell me
Every now and then she might spend
Sometime with another female's boyfriend
Why? I don't know, maybe for fun
If you got the burger, she got the buns
Who you do with it, is your own thing
One time she nominated me the Burger King
I think of it now, even as I rhyme
We all determined she's a real good time

But a stunt
Is just like a blunt
Burnt
And a hoe
Yo dukes, they burn you slow

[ VERSE 2 ]
A pair of tight pants is all it takes
And the next thing you know, old Jimmy's awake
Believe that, Jimmy has to get loose
I recommended her to be my personal masseuse
She's a real fly girl if you get to know that
Take her to a party, watch her throw that
Party into gear, like she was a jeep
Four-wheel drivin into the sheets

Stunts
Are just like blunts
Burnt
And a hoe
Word dukes, they burn you slow

[ VERSE 3 ]
The more you listen, the better it gets
I still haven't mentioned the girl's name yet
Anyway I continue, I do intend to
Say a little more, not to offend you
Baby, maybe you enjoy the diss
Tell me, love, do you remember this?
One Monday night it was me and the gees
On the avenue puffin the sensi
Hasheem and Foundation was on the phone
I broke out to see if you were home
Got to your house, went around the back
You had on a night gown with nothin underneath that
Took me in your room, hung up my coat
Asked me if I want to play _Love Boat_
""Yeah, how do you play it, remember?"", I said
Then you pushed me into your waterbed
Raised my sail, squabbed the deck
Came up and put a hickey on the side of her neck
Worked me over and got undressed
Sent me home and said I needed to rest
I went on the ave., weak as a mouse
Build wasn't out there, he was at your house
Stayed for an hour, then he left
Shabazz went in, Melquan went next
Hour by hour, minute by minute
I wonder if you cleaned it before we got in it
A few days later I said wait a minute
I saw all the Gods sittin in the health clinic

Stunts
Are just like blunts
Burnin
And the hoes
Word em up, they burnin slow

But the good news is: I have these penicillin shots for you]

[ VERSE 4 ]
There you have it, see what I mean?
Served my justice by a big butt in jeans
Now I know the actual truth
Never again will I mess with -
If you can rhyme, fill in the name
Don't get upset, just play the game
Remember her bark is worse than her bite
I wonder who the girl is with tonight
Maybe a drug seller, a crackhead, drunk
And he's nothin but a donut ready to dunk
She's nothin more than a female hound
Doin 3 to 6 years in the dog pound

But stunts
Yo dukes, just like blunts
Burnin
And the hoes
Word em up, they burnin slow

I hope my girl ain't checkin this out, man
I'd be in crazy trouble
But yo, I'ma get with y'all brothers later, man

King Sun,"Yeah baby, you lookin' lovely, very lovely
You know your man should appreciate you the way that I do
And my girl, she should appreciate me the way that you do, baby
But they have yet to understand one thing:

You are truly my undercover lover
Sharing a secret life so undiscovered
I sneak to meet such a girl so sweet
As we make love between satin sheets
The time we spend as nothing more than friends
You see me with my girl, I wink and you grin
We can't be together or showing a sign
Because you're with your man but I'm on your mind
Some say it's wrong to be so discrete
The way we meet and go some place to eat
I wine you and dine you and hold your hand
Baby, your wish is indeed my command
A wonderful time we have sitting and talking
Or even down by the pier just walking
Then we depart our little rendezvous
It's nice to have an undercover like you

[Chorus]
Undercover lover
Come into my life and brighten up my day
(Undercover, my lover, I love you)
Undercover lover
Come into my life and chase my fears away
(Undercover, my lover, I love you)

When you need someone close you can talk to
Then you call me, you just ought to
Know I like listening to you and your speaking
Half original, lovely Puerto-Rican
Just the type of girl I like keeping
I wonder if I say your name while I'm sleeping
That could cause a great bit of fight
So I stay awake and think about you at night
Sometimes I think my girl suspects something
She tries to diss you by calling you a dumb thing
I speak on your behalf, play it off and laugh
Go out to the phone booth and call you from the ave.
Arrange it to see you, hold you and love you
A dozen of roses shows I'm thinking of you
Don't get me wrong, I love her too
But it's nice to have an undercover like you

[Chorus]

The day goes by when I need to rely
On a dissolute relationship that you and I
Started as friends, extended and then 
A kiss led to more, we decided to pretend
Nothing is wrong cause there's nothing between us
People started rumors from the time they've seen us
Holding hands, smiling at each other
Even though we pass for sister and brother
A certain part of you belongs to me
The part that is soft, tender and sweet
That starts from the beautiful hair on your head
On down to the pretty little toes on your feet
Love me tender, female agenda
To your secret love I surrender
If there's one thing she's yet to discover
It's you, my beautiful undercover lover

Hey love
It might be wrong, what we doing and everything
But what they don't know won't hurt em at all

[Chorus]

Damn!",Undercover Lover
King Sunny Ade,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving 
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May 
Just as hate knows love's the cure 
You can rest your mind assure 
That I'll be loving you always 
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow 
But in passing will grow older every day 
Just as all is born is new 
Do know what I say is true 
That I'll be loving you always 

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky, always
Until the ocean covers every mountain high, always 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea, always 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 

Did you know that true love asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee 
To last through forever and another day 
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning 
And the seasons know exactly when to change 
Just as kindness knows no shame 
Know through all your joy and pain 
That I'll be loving you always 
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow 
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear 
For I'll know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've left behind Cause I'll be loving you always 

Until the day is night and night becomes the day, always
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away, always
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, always
Until the day that is the day that are no more 
Did you know that you're loved by somebody? 
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left, always
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself 
I'll be loving you forever 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through, always
Until the day that you are me and I am you, always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Always

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles 
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space 
But you can bet you life times that and twice its double 
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed 
so make sure when you say you're in it but not of it 
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell 
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love 
And maybe our children's grandchildren 
And their great-great grandchildren will tell 
I'll be loving you 

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky, loving you 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high, loving you 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea, loving you 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream, be loving you 
Until the day is night and night becomes the day, loving you 
Until the trees and seas up, up and fly away, loving you 
Until the day that 8x8x8x8 is 4--Loving you 
Until the day that is the day that are no more, loving you 
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left, be loving you 
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself, loving you 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through, loving you 
Until the day that you are me and I am you

Now ain't that loving you 
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Ain't that loving you 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high 
And I've got to say always 

Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea always
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream-Um always
Until the day is night and night becomes the day-always
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away-always
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself- ways
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through always
Until the day that you are me and I am you 
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 
Until the day is night and night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away 
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4 
Until the day that is the day that are no more

so the nigga keeps lookin, I'm not tryin to take yo' bitch
The rules of a pimp, hoes, you know
If the ho choose then you lose
Cause of the fact that I'm a mack and I can't hold back
shit from these punk-ass tricks
You better leave that ho and tell that old look ho you're free to go
and find somebody else out there that need your punk-ass

Never will I switch from a man to a bitch
cause I'm the, new rule, the six-shooter
I drink eight, cause only bitches drink coolers

They wanna label me best L.A. soloist
I couldn't be like that, but then again I could
Cause half of you MC's ain't no good
Anyway, hey, I got somethin to say
Directed to every MC in L.A.
You run up on the King - huh, how dumb
You knew from the beginning you shoulda brung a gun, son
Cause I be shootin the gift like it's a gift
Take the punk, slide em up just like a spliff
Then everything's cool and copacetic
I wrote the book on being cool, oh, you read it?
How'd you like the part where I tell you how to walk
The kinda clothes to wear, the use of slang in your talk?

Literally you can do what you want, see?
I'm more like the pilot or the driver of the scene
Or somethin that you usually dream
Yeah, I'm manufacturin the sickest metaphor
Lyrics you're not ready for
Hear it, I keep a steady score
Of suckers and muthafuckas who like to suffer
I wear big ropes in clusters
And I execute, never wore a sexy suit
I wear khakis with a t-shirt and hiking boots
A rare fashion with the gangster touch
Because Ballys don't mix and turtlenecks suck
But hey, I be crashin, throw in a accent
Maxin while I'm waxin the boots with passion
Happens to be one of my favourite attractions
The name's King Tee, but the T's for taxin
Phony MC's, them sucker punks wanna riff
Just because I wanna give the party a lift
You know, build your spirits expand your horizon
This particular production is mine's
And E-Swift's, the DJ E-Swift to be exact
Holds a hypnotizing scratch, make the others look whack

He got jacked for his dana's, in other words
(give it up nigga, give it up!)
He caught the nighttrain and blasted his thunderbird
With the pistol, him and cisco, couldn't stand him
Cause he caught him lickin brandy off his sister named kandi
At this point he had more bad luck than a trash truck
He lost his girl, remi spent his last buck up
Remi caught him shootin game at elayne, so now
Flowers and champagne don't mean a damn thang
Remi ended up runnin off with martin
He was wanted for arson for startin fires in carson
So johnnie hired a gun named rum, and paid him
151 and the job got done
With a thirty-eight straight to the face
He caught him in a six-pack and got they ass back
Up close he made 'em post and broke all their glasses
(? ) and rum threatened their families with matches
He felt he needed more men just like gin
So he packed his strap and started claimin silver satin
From then on in, anybody caught bailin
Down seagram's 7 was bound to get sweated
Except bartyles and james, cause they was cool
He knew 'em from school when they didn't bang and made moves
Turns out, he never reached the top
They found his ass at the beach ""on tha rox""

The name is King Tee, I pack guns like it's formal

Knockin MC's out cause I'm the best in this building
I be the G-are-E-A-T, plus majestic
Magical, radical, the technique is hectic
I, floss upon the scene in the front and back Caddy
Yeah, here goes Big Daddy, heh
In my trunk I keep a whole fifth of 'gnac
In there with some extra hollow points for my strap
Cause I bust on fools, I shoot down fools that front
The last of the few with the funk
King Tipsy, who flips the, rhymes like I'm crazy
You know these artificial gangsters can't fade Tee

Huh, I'm really into girls with fat cats
Hoochies, and hoes, and some hoodrats
I take 'em to the Snooty Fox for the spin
But if they real proper, we hit the Comfort Inn
I grab a fifth of Tanqueray and some Squirt
A fat bag of chronic then we're coolin like Levert
Turn on the porno flicks just to set the mood
Toss the bitch up and leave her ass in the room
Cause a bitch ain't shit like Snoop told it
All I do is toss and let the next man hold it
I chill at the bar because that's the spot
Where a bitch'll get ten dollars just rubbin on the cock
Yeah, Tee bein a trick won't work
You won't spend my money on no (??)
And that's real, comin from a real-ass G
I'ma just toss yo' ass like a salad beatch, you can't see me

Now I'ma take the third verse to the neck
Then ask who's next and, ask who wrecks?
I bring Tha Alkaholik spirit to the room
Down two 40's, then hit the boom
Release all your doubts cause, I'm what it's about
The funky drunk man, in front with the stout
And niggaz wanna test the fashion
Cause I bring passion, for those who's askin
I don't trip I just, hit the switch for the funk shit
I don't fuck with the punk shit
I slang my rap like crack, and niggaz be cluckin
A quick blast for the buck
Then they spark, and yo oh, peace to Mark
For the beat from Carolina to the Compton streets
They'll know, the original G, from the see-P-T

All aboard the mothership, prepare to set sail
Lyrics fat, swell as a killer whale
Enemies approachin, identify yourself
They're raisin up the flag, backin up they get to blast
Open fire, cannons let loose
Shut 'em down like the spruce goose
Captain aye aye, they still floatin
Give the order - blow they punk ass out the ocean, got 'em
Drink hit the dank as they sink to the bottom
Schools of sharks circles then the sea turned all purple
Even jacques costeau punk-ass was scared to go
And that just goes to show to uhh, let you know, uhh
As I chill again like gilligan and the skipper
A nigga kickin it with two hoes like jack tripper
Swabbin the deck, just stabbin in my cabin
Rubbed the magic lamp and out popped aladdin like ""what's happenin? ""
I said, ""what's up? I want my rhymes to be the dopest
Ala.. cadabara.. hocus pocus
You think they can see me? "" he said, ""nope not really
Cause the fog's in the air plus you're way out there""

Exhibit a through g, through z, e-n-t

Captivate the ear and then his eyesockets upon my pockets
I left him in suspense, who's the, tribes and crews?
Competition none exists bitches be blowin me kisses
Others fall like missiles, the cap was artificially flavored
My first verse, it quenched your thirst
For instance, I'm makin people boogie but yet
From long distance, causin it to interfere with your hemisphere
Flee, it's a g recipe
It get you hooked, havin fits off my shit

They wanna wipe us out! I think they hate us
Killers with the pencils and the papers and erasers

Shake ya whole area, break your sound barrier
So wake up if you sleep cause like a clock I tock I'm tickin
Early bird, get the worm, and I stopped slangin chickens
But I still be kickin facts, black, black on black crime
Why the hell you jackin me? I don't have a damn dime
My skills kill you like a deer with my spear
When it rains it pours he fell from the tier off the third floor
The pieces of the puzzle huh, figure it out
And start fuckin around and we'll be diggin you out
And it's just that simple put the thang up to your temple
And now you got a permanent dimple
It's king, tee, the name nigga and don't get snotty
Better knock on some doors and ask somebody (yeah)

",Way Out There
King Tee,"It's Friday night on the streets of L.A.
I'm goin' out, been hangin' round the house all day
So I take me a shower, dress like a big daddy
Stop at the Arco, put some gas in my Caddy
Armor on my wheels, shine up my Daytons
Check my 12-gauge, I see jackers just waitin'
Got in my car, rolled up the tinted glass
Looked for my zapp tape to pop in my dash
Can't find it, forget it, went under my seat
Found my old fired tape of the song ""knee deep""
So I popped it in, then I pumped it up
Love hearin' funk, because disco sucks
Body got chills when the basses started poundin'
I took off because I'm goin' to town, and
Won't be back 'til mornin', don't have to go to school
(Better get ready) I'm finna act a fool

Now I'm on the move, got a grand in my pocket
Reached for my phone, plugged it in the socket
Heard the dial tone, so I dialed up Aladdin
He answered the phone and said ""what's up?"" I said ""what's happenin'?""
He said, ""where you been? I been tryin' to get in touch
The party's in watts,"" I said, ""I don't give a fuck""
""If you want to go, just wear neutral colors
If anybody asks you, just tell 'em you're my brother""
Stopped at the store to buy me a Cisco
A 40 ounce and some crackers by Nabisco
(Amount) and I pulled out a 10
And said, ""fuck it, Supersacco and gin
I'm finna act a fool""

Now I'm drivin' down Compton on my way to get Aladdin
Feelin' like a pimp 'til my tape started draggin'
It's a old tape anyway, it ain't no thing
Pulled it out and slapped in dana dane
Got to Aladdin's house and I honked my horn
He said, ""when we comin' back?"" I said, ""6 in tha morn'""
So he got in the car, lookin half-dead
So I gave him my Cisco and took the 40 to the head
Now I'm feelin' tipsy, and I'm headed for watts
But wait, what do I see sittin' at the bus stop?
Sexy Susanna, had a butt that kills
Pretty long hair, but they say it's not real
Aladdin yelled ""these fake or real?"" she threw a rock in my glass
So I got out my car and drop-kicked her ass
I checked out my window, everything was cool
She was lucky I was nice and I didn't act a fool

We finally arrived at the party, drunk as a jerk
Got out my car, pressed the kit so the alarm, would chirp
After that we made our way, I tried not to fall
Couldn't walk a straight line if they let me crawl
Got to the door, and what spots my eye?
My homeboy Mr. Prince, and he's smokin' some Thai
So I stumbled his way and said, ""hey, pass the jay""
I took a hit for my mouth spray
This girl asked me to dance, but I told the hoe no
'Cause she was on my tip 'cause of my big gold rope
But it seems she got offended, that's splendid
Before she starts somethin', I just slap her and end it
'Cause I feel like a gangster, and I just don't care
About a girl with fake drag, fake eyes, fake hair
Fake clothes, fake nails and all that fake jewelery
All she want to do is tell her friends that she screwed me
I get nutty, act a fool when I want to
Run up when I'm drunk and I just might pump you
Take your car, your wife, keep talkin', your life
Beat you down and have you smokin' the pipe
(You know why?) 'Cause I'm cool

(Well, kill me! Shoot me, muthafucka!)
(I gotcha)

King Tee,"Hey King Tee, since this beat is kinda rockin'
I'ma let you rap and get the suckers cold clockin'
So yo loc', hear the beat I'm displayin'
(Yep)
But now listen to the guitar playin'

Listen to the guitar playin'
One, two, three

Yo, now if you're hip to me then I guess you heard bass
But I got another instrument to flaunt in your face
It's not a flute or a trumpet, don't beef 'cause you love it
A funky guitar rhythm that Pooh sampled and cut it

So for those who really know what dope stuff sounds like
If it sounds good, sounds funky or sounds hype
Put your ear to this and let me know what you think
Yo Pooh, bust the guitar while I grab me a drink

Listen to the guitar playin'
Listen to the guitar playin'

Now to many people this tune is like fazin'
Get the crowd dancin' with the funkiest persuasion
Hypnotizin' suckers with some personal-fication
Get the crowd movin', motivation
(C?mon)

See I'm like a symbol to MC's, I'm a father
No wait, I'm a lyricist, better yet a saga
Enough about the King 'cause you know I get far
I played with the bass, now I'm messin' with the guitar

And the way that it sounds you say shucks
It can't be real how the player just plucks on the strings
It rings yo, it's like the funkiest rhythm
Pooh brings the drums with the sticks to hit 'em

It's not ballet jazz punk rock or swing, it's dope
Rappin' brought by the T apostrophe King
And if I was in school and this was an assignment
I wouldn't type it or write it, I'd just rhyme it

'Cause rhyme is what I like, I got a metaphor background
A punk jumps up, I bust a verse, he sits back down
I wrote a epic, I hope you accept it
Fly stupid rhymes I composed and perfected

I'm down with some people that know what they're doin'
Darryl and Bobcat and Dwayne and DJ Pooh
And Keith Cooley is cool see, I'm the coolest person
Somebody drop the guitar before I start cursin'

Listen to the guitar playin'
Listen to the guitar playin'

So as it looks, the people like it
The funky guitar tune that we ignited
Pooh, I mean really, suckers be stumblin'
When they hear the funky guitar strummin'

You know frankly, I think this cut is kinda musical
Just like my bass song but don't get them confused though
The guitar gets your mind in the funky kind of state
And my bass makes the walls shake
(Yeah)

Suckers can't come close with what I got goin'
What I be doin', what I be showin'
How I be conquerin' and how I keep rulin'
What makes the King Tee stay so cool and

Where I get my Filas from, how I learned my slang
How could I afford such a big gold chain
And fly girlies tempt me when [unverified] wanna hit me
Why I drink brew 'til my body gets tipsy

To ask all the questions that I just spoke though
It's not magic or a hoax I'm just loco
I like bustin' on the funky dope track
Smooth like T, mo' powerful than a gat

Now that you know what's goin' around
(Come on)
Here comes the funky breakdown

That's smooth, man
That made me laugh at all these suckers, man
You laughin' too Pooh?
(Yeah, haha)

Listen to the guitar playin'
(Haha)
Listen to the guitar playin'
(Haha)

Yo Pooh, yo Pooh, break it down for a minute
Let me talk to the party
Now yo, me and Pooh is feelin' real hot right now, you know

But we want y'all to know, that see, me and my crew
We from Compton, y'all heard about Compton? Compton
(Compton)
Aight, see that's where we from

I rock the coolest rhymes, from here to Acapulco
I drive a Cadillac, not a played out DeSoto
Look I'm fin' to pose, photographer take my photo
Cool is back, in fact I'm comin' exact
It's MC Breeze and King Tee, and Pooh on the track
So we all got together, and thought of a freestyle
Gather round the stage, and come see how
Pros go for what they know and get paid for it
And I brung along the Breeze, so you can enjoy it
... And to fans I'm an idol
It's me and Breeze, ""Just Clowning"" is the title
Get up what's happening? I'm a King, not a Captain
Do the most coolest rappin', talk smack I'll be gat'n
I'm the King Tee punk, and I don't talk junk
But I do smoke blunt, love rappin' to funk
You know the mic is like a vine I swing on it like Tarzan
I drink a Coke and hit a note like Barbara Streisand
Step up, fess up, stand around and
Get down to the song ""Just Clowning""...

A dope rhyme and you won't find a
Nother MC who can get with this program
Served by no one, I mean no man
You say I'm good, it's the truth, you're not soupin'
I take it as a compliment and keep troopin'
Unlike most you know I never stop flowin'
My name is MC Breeze 'cause I'm the master at blowin'
Rhymes and lyrics, that is my specialty
I'm high-fidelity, you can't mess with me
Don't even think you can just sneak up
On bein' number one, is a high that I'm stuck on
I'm on a mission, wishin', all the time you spend
That you would make a legend or a monument
I'm not souped up, or a pooh-butt
I only lay my voice on a track that Pooh cuts
A beat is like food for thought so I eat it
I'm feelin' kinda hungry Pooh so just feed it
Keep the bass poundin' I like the way it's soundin'
Pooh is gettin' ill while me and Tee are just clowning

I've been rappin' for a while, I'm acquirin' chapstick
Like a magician with the mic I do a hat trick
I don't wear a cape, or perform at a sideshow
Let me hit the 40 'cause my throat is kinda dry yo
When I'm on stage it's like a Broadway play
King Tee and MC Breeze and Jennifer Holiday
But Breeze, my throat's gettin so'
Get on the mic and won'tcha give it a go

[MC Breeze:]
Clowning, is like actin' ill sometimes
But when I ill, I like to say a dumb rhyme
To increase my fame and star stature
I'm like Anita Baker I'm caught up in the ""Rapture""
Hittin' like bolos when I go solo
Last name is spanish but yo, I'm not a cholo
Keep the bass poundin', I like the way it's soundin'

Well it's Tuesday night, I got nuttin' to do
I guess I'll get on the phone and call DJ Pooh
Say ""Whassup Pooh? Are you beat?""
He say ""Forget that stuff, let's hit the street""
Since I got a Caddy, and you got a Z
I can roll witchu, or you can ride with me
I say ""We goin to a club that's dynamite"" (Where?)
The Red Onion on a Tuesday night
I walked in and glanced, shook a few hands
Grabbed the baddest broad, then I commence to dance
I looked the DJ, and said ""Whassup?""
He said ""Spade's in the place and he's doin' the butt""
Now I'm back to the rap that we have at hand
I'm the Mixmaster man with the master plan

Yo Spade, cool out! Man, we just clowning

King Tee,"See not long back when I was seventeen 
When I walk in the jam 
Suckers look at me mean 
They wouldn't give me respect 

Told girls I was wack 
You shouldn't have did that brother 
I'm here for the payback 

They spread rumors about the king 
They said that I was a front 
All my rhymes are wack 
All my cuts are bunk 

They said I live in a slum 
My father's a bum 
They said my sister's a crackhead 
My brother's drinkin' rum 

But I didn't let it bother me 
Took my time 
Sat at the kitchen table 
Wrote my rhymes 

And now that I'm eighteen,I'm not a kid no more 
I could walk in a nightclub and wop across the floor 
I'm a show you I'm good 
Make you wish that you could do the things that I do 

If I could teach you I would 
See,back then you didn't like me 
I stayed in your path 
See my name on a flyer 

You giggle and laugh 
Tell people I'm soft when I could really get off 
You didn't know it,now I show it 
I'm the Hip Hop boss 

See,people like you are known for fakin' 
Frontin' and bluffing and perpetratin' 
Biting and lyin' and always waitin' 
For me to come around and see how much I'm makin' 

See,money I got, 'cause I'm a pro at this trade 
You thought you got away 
But you're about to get paid 
You told girls I was wack 

Shouldn't have did that brother 
Look, I'm King tee and my payback's a mother 

As I talk you get madder 
Because the crowd starts to notice 
A professional rhymer,yeah,you must know this 
I'm cooler than most 

Most of all I'm so cool 
Never smacked on the crack 
Because I'm too busy in school 
See,I just think you're jealous 

And you envy my style 
You hear my rhymes,say it's weak 
But in your mind you're sayin' ""wow"" 
Tell people I'm ugly and I got big lips 

But as I walk by your girl 
She want to ride king's tip 
Going down in fame just remember my name 
Not a sapoe with a afro 

A king with a brain 
If a sucker gets beef 
And want to battle,let'em come 
We'll discuss it over lunch 

And drink some one-fifty-one 
After that I set a trap 
Even though I feel tipsy 
The crowd starts to clap 

And I ain't even got busy 
I'm great 
Some even say I'm a genius 
You said my crew was wack 

You haven't even seen us 
So I'll get you back 
Can't survive too long 
Tellin' lies about the king 

But I could take it I'm strong 
Got a Emmy in rap for usin' my cool strategy 
Rappin' was nominated to get a Academy 
The girlies I get,suckers probably get mad at me 

But I don't care 
King tee is the baddest,see 
Fila's my trademark 
I'm going for a medal 

Letting off some steam 
Like fire to the kettle 
Sportin' real gold and a baseball cap 
You better look out punk 
I'm here for the payback 

See,I'm macho supreme 
Head honch of the team 
Numero uno 
Kadafi of the Hip Hop scene 

I could be a cool rebel 
I'm already tuff 
Dominate rap artist 
Never spoke on a bluff 

Down and I'm hard 
When I'm rockin' I'm smooth 
I get a trophy for mostly doin' b-Boy moves 
Affiliated with a posse 

Let me go down to the list 
Scotty Dee,Keith Cooley 
And cold crush Chris 
Vatchiek's a pro 

He's also down with the krew 
The master mind of the drum 
Dj Cool Pooh 
If you ever get souped up 

You'll look like a poot butt 
You'll ask me to stop 
And I ask you to do what 
I won't stop till I paid you back 

By the time I'm through with you 
You'll want to smoke some crack 
Because I'm the King tee 
There is no other

King Tee,"Some cool shit for the King's anthology
And when I'm done, don't expect no apology
Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the Boondocks of Compton, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
I went to high school, but I flunked every class
So what makes you think I give a fuck about respect?
I'll put your bitch in check, and I'll bet
You won't run up, son of a punk and a bitch, too
I shoulda did a drive by on you and your crew
Cuz ya'll be poppin' some shit that's unheard of
For you, what's the word? Uh (wack!) it's murder, son
When I be crushin' your hood with a passion
And I ain't talkin' that Action Jackson
When I come you better run for ammo
Or get played like a fuckin' piano

And yo, we got my homeboy Ice Cube in the house from the motherfuckin'
Lench Mob (what's up, nigga?), and yo Ice Cube, I heard you're a singer now
Man what's up? Yo, yo

Do-Ray-Me. But I don't sing, mothafucker
I kick shit with the King, mothafucker
Ice Cube will clock the cash, rock the mass
And if you run up, I'll sock your ass
And watch that eye get swollen
Cuz I'm playin' punk niggas like Beethoven
So bust a cap or swing and die
Fuck Yul Brynner, it's still The King and I
Cuz where I'm from the sun don't shine
So One-Time hope I only bust one rhyme
But I bust one more for the suckers
Last year I was Ruthless, now I'm Lenchin' mothafuckers
And you'll see in a tree, MCs and crews
Now they're lookin' for me, King Tee, and Pooh
Now every nigga that crossed me's soprano
Cuz I played their ass like a fuckin' piano

Yo, check this out, we got my homeboy Breeze in the
Motherfuckin' house from the L.A. Posse
and he got some shit to holler
Come
On, man, bust this shit

Well, I'm-a take the mic like it was a jack move
Run with the beat as long as the track moves
Hot as lava, organized like a seminar
Serve you, your crew, him, and them and a
Couple of rap-saps who think they can get butt
You slipped and shit, so nitwit, just get the nuts
Stealin' your high hopes, watchin' you write notes
Better walk a chalk line, not fuckin' a tightrope
Rap slicker, thicker, quicker than others, then I stop swift
Shift from 1st to 5th, while you stop to shoplift
Take the mic stand whenever the duty calls
If I bust a nut for every rhyme I had, I'd get blue balls
Serious as drama, I'm-a watch her say ""Me too.""
You're shorter than Michu, your rhymes are see-through
You're nothin' like GQ, transparent, I made it apparent
I'm here to wax and tax the incoherent
Cuz B-R-E-E-Z-E will eas-i-ly re-main to be-e a top MC
When you see me, I wear a beanie, and not a Kangol
Now you got played, like a fuckin' piano

This is just a sample of three black nig-roes
Who grew up in the heart of the ghetto
Doin' what we had to just to make ends meet
Some steal for a livin', some stand on the street
Just slang. Some gang-bang, but big deal
They say in Compton, you gotta kill or get killed
Mothafuckin' police pull ya over, slam ya down
Then tell ya that your hood is their town
And I ain't goin' for no shit like that;
Cuff me up, take me to jail, I'll come back
Talkin' much shit, cuz I talk what the fuck I feel
A few weeks in the county ain't no big deal
So a punk like you can't fuck with me
That big ballin'-ass nigga named King Tee
You think ya can? I don't think that you can, though

Ah, one of those hypso-change-o-calypso-beat-a-matics
There'll be another ruff rhyme
When I'm done there'll be another ruff rhyme

Another package from your slick Royal Highness
Pay attention, so you won't have to rewind this
Put yourself together for another funky clip
I bring a lotta magic, but this ain't no trick

It's pure skill I possess in my possession
A crazy rhythm and my funky horn section
And Pooh hyped up this funky ol' track
So I thought about it, I'm comin' I'm back

When I'm done
I'm back when I'm done
King Tee is back again

Now let me talk to ya to the best of my ability
About the kid that's rockin' this facility
I bring to you peace and tranquility
Don't try to front, 'cause I know you feel it, see

My beats are masculine, I think that there hasn't been
A better groove to keep you like dancing, man
I feel thankful to feel there ain't no
Sucker tryin' to gank my spot, least I think so

But I don't sweat, 'cause I can stand on my two feet
Hold the mic and just curse the beat
I don't complain about the crowd I attract
Roll out the red carpet, I'm comin', I'm back

When I'm done there'll be another ruff rhyme
King Tee is back again
There'll be another ruff rhyme when I'm done
I'm back, King Tee is back again

Well, this might seem odd
You ask who taught me, well, it musta been God
'Cause ain't none of y'all cool like me
The impresario, majestic Tee

Some rappers are scared of me, they say when they dare to be
Threatened, well, keep on steppin', I'll be prepared to be
Jacked, Jack, cause your rhymes don't match
You got bold when I left, now I'm back

To stomp you, 'cause you stomp wrong, so I'ma stomp on
Fool, you forgot, I'm from Compton
This is just a taste of my album, really nothin'
Just to show you I'm back, I'm comin'

When I'm done, there'll be another ruff rhyme
King Tee is back again, there'll be another ruff rhyme
When I'm done, there'll be another ruff rhyme
King Tee is back again, there'll be another ruff rhyme

Back again, back again, back again
There'll be another ruff rhyme
There'll be another ruff rhyme
When I'm done, there'll be another ruff rhyme
Ruff rhyme, ruff rhyme, ruff rhyme
When I'm done, there'll be another ruff rhyme

King Tee,"[ verse 1: king tee ]
They live on the street and they hustle for fame
Some kill for a livin, some sling cocaine
Because it's now a lifestyle and a full-time job
And if you live in compton, it's like at mccobb
From block to block everybody's bad
And if you don't know where you're at, then your life's been had
Cause they walk in the street with intentions to meet
Some sappy lookin punk with fila on his feet
And if you try to act tough, well mr. tough, you're through
Cause everybody's a family, if not, they're a crew
I'm here to give some advice advice (run!)
Cause if you're ever in compton, you better bring a gun

Yo, here come my homeboy mixmaster spade
Man, what's up, man?
Hey man, ain't you from compton, man?
(ah yeah)
Alright man, tell em what's up, man
What you used to do

[ verse 2: mixmaster spade ]
I used to cut up the beat on the two turntables
Now I'm rappin on the mic, cause I'm willin and able
When I'm on the mic I take no slack
And everytime that you see me I'm tearin a gat
I got .380s and .22s
You messs with me, I'm gonna bust on you
I got a .357 and a m-16
They call me master spade, and tee's the king
Now compton is the city where the homeboys stay
Rollin in a different car everyday
Can't roll too hard, gotta watch my back
Cause if I don't, I just might get jacked
Now compton is a city of a lotta fun
(can't walk down the street
(can't walk down the street
Can't walk down the stree without my gun)

[ female voice ]
Now you know this just don't make no kinda sense

[ verse 3: king tee ]
Now the next place is kinda risky if you're walkin with your mother
Y'all can get shot if she wears the wrong color
They're all from the old school, nobody's modern
The place I'm talkin 'bout is the nickerson gardens
You can get away with murder, cause they murdered the cops
Cause they said they tried to run a bumrush on watts
But they took control, slingers walk real tall
While real down gangbangers write their set on the wall
If I was you I wouldn't visit here, it's like hell
And if you get robbed, who you gonna tell?
I'm only here for advice advice (run!)
And if you're ever in watts, you better bring a gun

[ verse 4: king tee ]
Now you got a nice car with a brand-new paintin
Rag top convertable with all-gold daytons
You decide to take a ride down the crenshaw strip
You stop at the fat burgers to feed your lip
You got your sounds bumpin, playin zapp and vibe
A skeezer comes your way, you say, ""let's take a ride""
So you're cruisin crenshaw with her, you're goin to bail
A brown cutlass pulls up, they put a gauge to your head
They say, ""(get our your car) if you value your life
(and leave your money) if you love your wife""
Now you're standin in the street lookin like you're on crack
And you say to yourself: I can't believe I got jacked
You call the police because your car they stole
But when you get in touch with them, they put you on hold
Your car is gone, nothin could be done
So next time you cruise crenshaw, you better bring a gun!

Alright, I wanna thank mixmaster spade for comin out to rock with me
(and greg mack) the mack attack
And I also wanna thank j-ro and sweet tooth for comin out rockin
(and dj [name])
And I wanna thank scotty d, cold-crush chris
And dj pooh, the hip-hop gangster
(when he say beat em up he don't be bluffin)

And oh yeah, I forgot somebody

Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.

King's Singers,"Well, this is one of those songs that you hear now and then

Yes, it's one of those songs that you hear for awhile
That come into fashion, then go out of style
It's one of those songs that you think you forgot
But it's one of those songs you cannot

Because it's one of those songs that can make you recall
A ride in the springtime, a walk in the fall
A day in the country, a night on the town
The sun coming up or the rain coming down

Or else the evening you parted, the morning you met
The love of your life you can never forget
The reason is simple, the memory belongs
To one of those wonderful songs

Well, this is one of those songs that's so easy to hear
You listen just once, and you play it by ear
It's hummed on verandas and strummed on guitars
And all you remember is ""lah-dah-dah-dah""

But later on you recall it in some other year
You may start to smile or you may shed a tear
You'll find that a part of your lifetime belongs

Where the lads and lasses are making of hay;
There should I see what is pleasant to me,
A mischief light on them entic'd me away!


I like not the court, nor the city resort,
Since there is no fancy tor sucn maids as me;
Their pomp and their pride I can never abide,
Because with my humor it does not agree.


How oft have I been in the Westmoreland green,
Where the young men and maidens resort for to play,
Where we with  delight, from morning till night,
Could feast it and frolic on each holiday.


The ewes and their lambs, with the kids and their dam:
To see in the country how finely they play;
The bells they do ring, and  the birds they do sing,
And the fields and the gardens are pleasant and gay.


At wakes and at fairs, being freed of all cares,
We there with our lovers did use for to dance;
Then hard hap had I, my ill fortune to try,
And so up to London, my steps to advance.


But still I perceive, I a husband might have,
If I to the city my mind could but frame;
But I'll have a lad that is North Country bred,
Or else I'll not marry, in the mind that I am.


A maiden I am,  and a maid I'll remain,
Until my own country again do I see,
For here in this place I shall ne'er  see  the face
Of him that's allotted my love  for to be.


Then farewell my daddy, and farewell my mammy,
Until I do see you, I nothing but mourn;
Rememb'ring my brothers, my  sisters, and others,
In less than a year I hope to return.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Finding comfort in the friends we knew,
Now it's just me and you
Trying alone;
We used to get along

Now those days are gone.

Playing with words
When there's nothing much to say,
Searching to find what we lost along the way.
Could it be one day our feelings changed?
I hope we see it through
Cos I just can't stand the thought
of life without you.

Dreaming...
Whispers echo on the summer wind
Back when the love begins,
When nights were so warm
With stars we could wish upon...

Now those days are gone.

We had the chance
But we lost it all somehow,
Broken the spell
And our dreams lie heavy now
Could it be someday our feelings changed?
I hope we see it through
'cos I just can't stand the thought
of life without you.

'cos I just can't stand the thought of life without
you.

Thinking...
Long ago when we were young and free
Love happened suddenly,
And we couldn't see
Where we were going wrong

a-pickin' the beautiful, primitive rose
all the more she plucked, the more she pulled
until she got her apron full 

it's out ... it's out of the roses
she made a bed
a stormy pillow for her head
she lay her down, nowhere she spoke

King's Singers,"A long, long time ago...
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile.
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And, maybe, they?d be happy for a while.

But february made me shiver
With every paper I?d deliver.
Bad news on the doorstep;
I couldn?t take one more step.

I can?t remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride,
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died.

So bye-bye, miss american pie.
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
And them good old boys were drinkin? whiskey and rye
Singin?, ""this?ll be the day that I die.
""this?ll be the day that I die.""

Did you write the book of love,
And do you have faith in God above,
If the Bible tells you so? 
Do you believe in rock ?n roll,
Can music save your mortal soul,
And can you teach me how to dance real slow? 

Well, I know that you?re in love with him
`cause I saw you dancin? in the gym.
You both kicked off your shoes.
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues.

I was a lonely teenage broncin? buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck,
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died.

I started singin?,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin? whiskey and rye
And singin?, ""this?ll be the day that I die.
""this?ll be the day that I die.""

Now for ten years we?ve been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin? stone,
But that?s not how it used to be.
When the jester sang for the king and queen,
In a coat he borrowed from james dean
And a voice that came from you and me,

Oh, and while the king was looking down,
The jester stole his thorny crown.
The courtroom was adjourned;
No verdict was returned.
And while lennon read a book of marx,
The quartet practiced in the park,
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died.

We were singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin? whiskey and rye
And singin?, ""this?ll be the day that I die.
""this?ll be the day that I die.""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter.
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter,
Eight miles high and falling fast.
It landed foul on the grass.
The players tried for a forward pass,
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune.
We all got up to dance,
Oh, but we never got the chance!
`cause the players tried to take the field;
The marching band refused to yield.
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died? 

We started singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin? whiskey and rye
And singin?, ""this?ll be the day that I die.
""this?ll be the day that I die.""

Oh, and there we were all in one place,
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again.
So come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!
Jack flash sat on a candlestick
Cause fire is the devil?s only friend.

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage.
No angel born in hell
Could break that satan?s spell.
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite,
I saw satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin? whiskey and rye
And singin?, ""this?ll be the day that I die.
""this?ll be the day that I die.""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news,
But she just smiled and turned away.
I went down to the sacred store
Where I?d heard the music years before,
But the man there said the music wouldn?t play.

And in the streets: the children screamed,
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.
But not a word was spoken;
The church bells all were broken.
And the three men I admire most:
The father, son, and the holy ghost,
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died.

And they were singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
And them good old boys were drinkin? whiskey and rye
Singin?, ""this?ll be the day that I die.
""this?ll be the day that I die.""

King's Singers,"I am just a poor boy.
Though my story's seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles,
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest.
When I left my home
And my family,
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station,
Running scared,
Laying low,
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go,
Looking for the places
Only they would know.

Lie-la-lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job,

But I get no offers.
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare,
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there.

Lie-la-lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me,
Leading me,
Going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer,
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame,
I am leaving, I am leaving.
But the fighter still remains",The Boxer
King's Singers,"Somewhere down the road, you're gonna find a place
It seems so far, but it never is
You won't need to stay, but you might lose your strength
On the way

Sometimes you may feel you're the only one
Cos all the things you thought were safe, now they're gone
But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along
Watching you 'til all your work is done

When you find your heart, you'd better run with it
Cos when she comes along, she could be breaking it
No there's nothing wrong, you're learning to be strong
Don't look back
She may soon be gone, no don't look back
She's not the only one, remember that

If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right
You don't know what to do? 
Remember she is just as scared as you

Don't be shy, even when it hurts to say
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway
Then you must lift your head, keep it there
Remember what I said
I'll always be with you don't forget
Just look over your shoulder I'll be there.

If you look behind you, I will be there.","Father to Son, song"

Haunting notes pizzicato strings

It fades to the distance.

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, 
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, 
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.

A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, 
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in

Names and words they hurt you
Effecting everything

No one should be made to feel they're ugly
And to feel ashamed

No one should be made to feel alone

It's obvious, the harmony is already gone
Can't go back, we're wasting time the deed is done
See you later, I don't need you hanging on

Too late, I know your name
We just have lost the spark you played, heavyweight
Much too late, there is no more time, you know
You're not so precious, that I can't let go

Constantly assuring me that I'm the one
While you telling others what a fool I am
Now you finally figuered out, that you were wrong
Can't undo the scars, but now the pain is gone

The well is dry, time to say good bye
You did me wrong, thought I play along
I want out, now, cause you're not what I need
Get away, get away, no one like you is gonna make me bleed

'til I figured out, which way I should go
Knowing the way, it sure ain't enough
But having found you, I've changed so much

Rather later, then never at all
I drop my defenses, catch my fall
I'm praying to God, that you're the one
The perfect match, my fear is gone

Nothing else matters, I'll give up control
The time I've wasted, If only I had known
Here I surrender, take my heart
Forever with you, in peace and love

So innocent and true
An everlasting love
Forever me and you

He was born one winter night on a road between two towns
They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will

It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Shows me all the good times,
Tells me I look better,
Chews me up and spits me out,
And then walks my ass home.
And sings a song,
When I'm gone, gone, gone.

A little friend,
Shoots me up and downtown,
When I can't get me drunk enough,
To bring me out the pieces,
Of a place I call home.
To sing a song,
'Til I'm gone, gone, gone.

Showers me in bruises,

Everybody has troubles 
Life's a constant struggle 

Yo, Step into reality, it's a cold cold world 
You got to learn to accept it, feels like I've been neglected 
All these bands coming out and they sound alright 
All these videos on tv and they look alright 
I spent my whole life spilling my guts between the lines 
Putting in more work than you will ever know than when I rhyme 
Tryin to press the people so I can reach the masses 
Give them what they want with this pen that's plastic (Life)
I got a message I'm a put it in a bottle 
Sign the bottom of the paper and let the whole world swallow 
Today can be tomorrow, ain't no telling when I'm leaving 
I'm a rock this microphone even when I'm barely breathin' 
When you start sleepin, D-loc starts creepin 
When you actin a fool, D-loc's always thinking 
Be clever when you play me because it's comin back to hull 
I can feel my heats rising and it's pissin me off 
And when it's pissin me off I got no choice 
But to crack snap back at you like a chain reaction 
I'm gettin older dog you better watch your mouth 
You better think before you speak on the mic or get knocked out 
It's been a minute and your shit better stop 
Bring your punk ass back to Cali, bitch ass get popped 
You ain't never in Cali, wonder why they don't accept you 
Your sound's getten flopped, plus you got a fuckin attitude 

Life
Life's a constant struggle 

I was never really understood, had a lot of misunderstandings 
Not too many saw my plan, so it left me standing in my own two shoes 
Now what the fuck was I suppose to do? 
Givin a fight, be a man or take my life 
To make ends meet I did more wrongs than rights
Couldn't hold a job, I can't handle being bossed
In and out of rehabs, from border schools I was tossed 
Started hanging with the wrong crowd 
Caught slanging by my pops and got thrown out 
On my own once again I had to make it happen 
That's just a little of my life before I started rappin' 
But I always kept in touch with my dog Dustin 
That's the one friend that I never stopped trusting 
Next thing you know I'm living over at his pad 
Me and him and Saint we was workin for his dad 
Drinkin tallboys after work every night 
Takin hits in the garage out of metal pipes 
Working long ass hours no 9 to 5 
But you gotta do what it takes to survive 
That's around the time that we met Daddy X 
And ever since then we've been on a new quest 
Kottonmouth was formed so it began a new chapter 
Of my life that I'm livin til I'm in the after after

Everybody has troubles

Kingspade,"One day when I'm older
Yeah when I grow up

Just a young buck growing up living fast
18 years old know it all on the gas
Big dreams of being a superstar
Having nice things and
A pocket full of cash
Basketball, baseball, rapper, an actor whatever
Whatevers gunna make my life better if it last
Big house, nice cars, nice brawl
You know every kids dream as so it seems 
I mean come on now people all around doing big things
Best friends getting rich
Neighbors turn athletes, clothing companies, million dollar factories
Actually everybody say it with me
If you really want to be you could be what you wanna be 
That's the life if it just gets tight
Work hard and you could be a role model 
Let's do it

[Chorus]
One day when I'm older
(Im'ma buy a thousand houses and drive a thousand cars)
Yeah when I grow up
(Im'ma play point guard for the NBA)
One day when I'm older
(Im'ma fly a airplane and go around the world)
Yeah when I grow up
Yeah you'll see every kid has a dream

When I was just a young buck in the single digits
I had too many thoughts on life and how to live it
So many dreams and different things I wanted to be
But that's what you'll be young and freedom of dream
I remember I wanted to be a fireman
So I can help people out around the sirens
Next day played football between streets knots
Next day wake up imam be your next doc
Cram through the air and hold up the dirt
Keeping up playing if it didn't even hurt
Riding home with my knee and elbow making blood
Know I wanna see moms imam get a lot of love
Never ever know what's up in national news 
Only thing you worry about is the school lunch menus
Eating all the places and being captain of the team
First ten years of life is a beautiful thing

[Chorus] 

You see me making moves, and 1, and 2 
3, 4's never no time to sleep
Ricky and mommy living the dream caught now
That's what its gonna be

I never know nothin' else and
I never finished school but
I'm smarter then the average bigs and that's boo boo
Dreams do come true
A living proof 'cause I'm making money 
Doing what I love to do
Dreams come true
Yeah dreams come true
Yeah you'll see every kid has a dream
I said dreams come true
Dreams come true
Yeah you'll see every kid has a dream

Sad, mislead or fooled

Time to see in what we believe 
As the time goes by, we'll know that it was on our side 
But come to understand (stand under?) the time 
And you'll realize it's in your mind 

One day we're all gonna laugh about it 
About how easy we are to rule 
To take our innerselves away from us 
And knock, knock, knocking it on up there 
Where we are, blinded with faith in something called ""the only truth !?""

Ah si... elles sont là
C'est marrant j'm'en rappelais pas
Faut rentrer chez toi
Marcher devant soi
Compter les kilomètres
10, 15, 20 bornes peut-être...

Je rends à la terre ce qu'elle a de mieux

Marcher dans la forêt
Ça fait du bien, c'est frais

Quasimodo was jerking in hard

Riding in on Saint-Bernards

Kinky,"I'm walking alone again
With my headphones on
And I don't want this anymore,
To hit the streets without a chord
Now this city is my song
Where I submerge myself
Taking a long walk around the block
Every little step,
Every single step becomes a note
That I draw on the staff lines of the sidewalk

I'm walking alone again, with my headphones on
And I really really wanna run
But at this moment, I'm listening to a very very soft song

I'm walking again alone
With my headphones on
And now I speak and I'm screaming
Because I can't hear my own voice

I'm walking alone again
With my headphones on
I have to walk between smog
Behind sunglasses, inside my clothes

Sometimes,I feel that every simple thing has a sound
And if it does
What kind of shape does the silence have?

Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walks with me
No one really hears it

Sometimes I feel like everything has a sound
And if it does
What kind of shape does the silence have?
A sparkling new? A pocket size?
A white one? A smoke one?
One that you can use as a tattoo
Or as a flag as an umbrella
To protect you against the rain
Of noise that the city has?
Or maybe it's a package,
Where the secret comes from

Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walks with me
No one really hears it
Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it

Kinky,"Hace 8 noches María José se fue a tomar ala cantina
Un solo trago
Que se convirtió en un botella una botella
Que contiene un litro entero de tequila
Con un gusano en el fondo descansando boca arriba

Ese gusano corono el ultimo trago
Maria José tomo
Justo antes de la despedida
Luego tambaleando hasta su cama
Donde se durmió enseguida
Con el gusano en su vientre navegando en el tequila

Y si tomar te hace dormir
Y si tu amor se ahoga en alcohol
No vas a despertar jamas

Durmió por mas de 7 días
Llego un doctor y contra el mal del sueño
No pudo alguna cura o medicina
Hay que esperar pacientemente a que el mismo
Habra la pupila

Abrió Maria José los ojos hasta quedar 
Completamente despierto despertó y se quito la ropa empezó a pujar
Como preparándose a dar a luz

So they recommend bare feet to sleep
If you wants Morpheus with you

They say the trees wear their clothes backwards
In the summer they wear leaf coats
And in the winter they take them off

I'm not afraid of the world, I'm not afraid to roller coster

They say comets are like animals with large and bright tails
And they gallop through the night
They say rugs are just floors with over grown hair
And the broom is the comb, the vacuum is the blow dryer

Though I believe
I'm a tree I can't stand outside naked with the breeze",Not Afraid

Kinky,"I'm walking alone again with my headphones on again
I don't want this anymore, to hit the streets without a chord
Now this city is my song where I submerge myself

Taking a long walk around the block
Every little step, every single step becomes a note
That I draw on the staff lines of the sidewalk

I'm walking alone again, with my headphones on again
And I really wanna run but at this moment
I'm listening to a very, very quiet song

I'm walking alone again with my headphones on
And now I speak and I'm screaming
Because I can't hear my own voice

I'm walking alone again with my headphones on
I have to walk between smog, behind sunglasses inside my clothes
Sometimes I feel that every simple thing has a sound
And if it does, what kind of shape does the silence have?

Even if the silence still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walks with me
No one really hears it

Sometimes it seems like everything I see has a sound
And if it does, what is the shape of silence?
A sparkling new? A pocket size?
A white one? A smoke one?

One that is on your arm as a tattoo
Or a waving flag on the back of your car
As an umbrella to protect you against
The rain of noise that the city has?
Or maybe it's just a small envelope with a secret inside

Even if the silence still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walk with me
No one really hears it

Every little step, every single step
I'm walking alone again, I'm walking
I'm walking alone

Even if the silence still with me
No one can hear it
I'm walking alone again, I'm walking
I'm walking alone

Even if the silence still with me
Every little step, every single step becomes [incomprehensible]
Even if the silence still with me
I don't want this anymore to hit the street without a chord

Way up there on the Texas Tower 
Shooting from the twenty-seventh floor. Yahoo! 
He didn't choke or slash or slit them, 
Not our Charles Joseph Whitman, 
He won't be an architect no more. 
Got up that morning calm and cool, 
He picked up his guns and walked to school. 
All the while he smiled so sweetly 
And it blew their minds completely, 
They'd never seen an Eagle Scout so cruel.

For the school's administration 
He put on such a bold and brassy show.

Wild ponies all your dreams were broken 
Rounded out and made to move along
The loneliness which can't be spoken 
Just swings a rope and rides inside a song

Dead limbs play with ringless fingers 
A melody which burns you deep inside
Oh, how the song becomes the singers
May peace be ever with you as you ride 

How long will you be driven relentless around the world
The blood in the rhythm of the soul

In the window candles glowing 
Remind you that today you are a child
Road ahead, forever rolling
And anything worth cryin' can be smiled

Down by the Union Station with that ol' hat in his hand.

And the station-master pointed to the sign

Out in the falling snow he'd sing his song 
To a world too cold to listen and too white to sing along.

Done left him without a dime. 
Ever since the good Lord took his wife 
You'll find him strummin' on the corner all the time. 
And most of Music City never the saw the world within the song 
Of a Nashville casualty and life goes on. 

In the attic sets a dusty hat and cane 
And the kids they found a banjo there all rusted from the rain. 
I strummed a little rusty rag-time beat 
And I sang for every soul out on the street.

His black and blinded face reflectin' all the pain 
Of all the years and people passin' by 
And all the ringin' memories that can make a banjo cry.

'Bout a brave young Indian lad, you should remember well, 
From a tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and peaceful band 
Who farmed the Phoenix Valley out in Arizona land. 

Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed 
Till the white man stole the water rights and the running water hushed. 
Ira's folks was hungry, their fields grew thick with weeds, 
But when war came Ira volunteered and forgot the white man's greed. 

Call him drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore, 
Not that whiskey drinking Indian or Marine who went to war. 

Well, they battled up Iwo Jima Hill, two hundred and fifty men 
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again. 
And after the fight was over and Old Glory proudly raised, 
Among the men who held her high was an Indian, Ira Hayes. 

Call him drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore, 
Not that whiskey drinking Indian or Marine who went to war. 

Well, Ira Hayes returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land, 
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand. 
But he's just a Pima Indian, no food, no friend, no chance, 
And nobody cared what Ira did and when do the Indians dance. 

Well, Ira took to drinking hard, jail often was his home, 
They used to let him raise the flag there and lower it just like you'd throw a dog a bone. 
And Ira died drunk early one morning all alone in the land he'd fought to save. 
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes. 

Call him drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore, 
Not that whiskey drinking Indian or Marine who went to war.

Catfish on the mound.

Batter have to go back and sit down.
Catfish, million dollar man.
Nobody can throw the ball like catfish can.
Used to work on mr. finley's farm
But the old man would not pay.
So he packed his glove and took his arm
And one day he just ran away.

Nobody can throw that ball like catfish can.

Smoke a custom made cigar.

Hello good mornin', its suddenly dawnin'
That its been awhile.
Last night I dreamed of a Hollywood queen,
She was wearin' your smile.
But yesterday's gone, girl, its only a song, girl,
It's hardly a crime.
Hello, good mornin', its suddenly dawnin'
That you're still on my mind.

Hello, good mornin', its suddenly dawnin'
That I need a friend.
Hope it ain't wrong but I found myself longin'
To call you again.
What Indian-giver took back that river
And that warm summer rain ?
Hello, good mornin', its suddenly dawnin'
That I miss you again.

Oh I know its early, we're both in a hurry,
But its already late.
I always loved you, I still dream of you,
But the car pool won't wait.
When I used to hold you, remember I told you
That you'd be someone,
Or was it Cinderella tellin' Rockefeller
That time is the money of love ?

Hello, good mornin', its suddenly dawnin'
That I need a friend.
Hope it ain't wrong but I found myself longin'

Using vulgar words of language and his wife she overheard. 

Well, Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain, the deputy grabbed his gun

And many a starving farmer he opened up his door.

Kinleys,"No he ain't perfect, this man of mine.
He wrote me a love song, but the words don't rhyme.
He drives me crazy, how he's late all the time,
But I love my baby just the same.
The reasons why, are hard to explain.

[Chorus]
He makes me feel ooh...aah.
I can't quite describe it.
Something 'bout that boy makes me get up and sing.
My heart goes mmm...oooh.
The only way to say, it is a crazy kind of love thing.

He steals all my best jokes, and gets the punch lines wrong.
For my birthday, he bought me Amarige, but left the price tag on.
He says, I can do that, when we're watching James Bond.
But that's the funny thing about love;
He's my baby all because.

[Chorus]

He may not always notice what I do with my hair,
But he sure knows when to hold my hand.
He sings off key, wait a minute, I don't care;
That's my baby, that's my man.

But that's the funny thing about love,
He's my baby all because what he does.

That's what matters after all, here.

Once our hearts both shared a common destination
To love until the end of time

Someone?s gotta take the wheel
I won?t wait until it?s too late to recover
So let me tell you how I feel

I?ll do anything if it?ll bring our hearts together
I?ll stand and fight or get down on my knees
If we can fix what?s wrong and just go on in love forever
Baby I?ll be beggin? please

I?m strong enough to handle any situation
But honey true love has no pride
So I can say without a moments hesitation
Before I?ll let you say goodbye

I?ll do anything if it?ll bring our hearts together
I?ll stand and fight or get down on my knees

The music faded down the boulevard
Streets of empty silence cried out loud
Telling me that I need you now

Lonely whistle of a passing train
That calls to me in the pouring rain
A face I never see in every crowd
Reminds me that I need you now

I'll never get over you
'Cause everything I do
Leads me back to you somehow
Like a fool I believed
That you would never leave
I let you walk away
I was just too proud
To tell you then
That I need you now

Now I wonder how you stayed so long
In a love where honesty was not allowed

The brightness of eternal breath
And nations of fashion

Kinnie Starr,"Some girls wear their hair up off their lovely faces,
And some gaze straight ahead 'cause they are trying to go places.
Some times we go together and other times apart,
But I like to think we hold out fists up, trying to make a new start, but,

Here is a story about walking the other day
And every day is special but some things just never change, you see
He looks at she, she looks away, okay hips sway, why is everyday a boy day?
He looks at she, she looks away, okay hips sway, I guess it's another boy day.

And we could call it out when it doesn't suit us both,
'cause there's a magnitude of choices and a really big boat, 
And that big boat floats on a restless ocean,
Singing about the chances of protective devotion,
For the girlfriend who stands on the street waiting on a trick and
Some man demands that she lifts her skirt quick.

She's got a mother, a daughter and a lover,
You tell me why she shouldn't have safe cover.
She's got a mother, a daughter and a lover,
You tell me why she shouldn't have safe cover.

'cause if the laws made sense,
She would have a legal fence,
To keep her clientele clean and she could still pay the rent.

She's got a mother, a daughter and a lover,
You tell me why she shouldn't have safe cover.
She's got a mother, a daughter and a lover,
You tell me why she shouldn't have safe cover.

Now, my skin is green, some think it's Italian that gives me that sheen,
And I have to thank my father for the proud red blood that makes me, me, but see?
Boy on the street's got his eyes pinned on to me,
Buttons unbuttoned in his head, he wants to see?
The shades, and the sizes, the hand prints, shoe fits!
Shades, sizes, hand prints, shoe fits!
The shades, the sizes, the hand prints, the shoe fits!
And off with the underwear, my dreamy smell lies there, but?
This is not fair, because he penetrates me with his stare
This is not far, because he penetrates me with his stare.

'cause I wanna walk down the long pass of flowers,
I wanna sing songs that mesmerize for hours.
I wanna feel that freedom to be sexy,
Without his eyes sliding all up and under me.
I wanna feel that freedom to be sexy,
Without his eyes sliding all up, under, into me.

Gretchen was a grad student working on her masters a little too smart for me
Tammy was a teacher her daddy was a preacher evil as a girl could be
Yeah Megan was a millionaire senator's daughter my collar was too damn blue
Miss Virginia sure was fine but Mary was the marrying kind

How could I've been so blind?

Mary was a blond blue eyed girl next door with an angel face
I figure I could find her wild side so I took her on a couple of dates
She was sweet and smart had a queen size heart nothing like the other girls
She just laughed at my best line cause Mary was the marrying kind

Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail

Find the muscle in this car
I know it’s still got something left
Yeah come on out, take my hand
Feel my heart, girl understand
I gotta thunder pounding in my chest
Hey yeah, can’t see you as nothing but mine
And girl tonight, let's go crazy one more time

We’ll park the car, climb on the hood
Turn it up, when something good starts
Playing through these rusted doors
And in this sticky and sweet hair tonight
I’ll kiss you girl till I get it right
'Cause I know that it'll lead to more

We devour rolling around
Where I’ll gently lay you down
And I’ll try to tell you how I feel
But you place your finger on my mouth
Whisper “Baby, no not now
The night is young and we still got time to steal""
Hey yeah, can’t see you as nothing but mine

I watch you fall fast asleep
And this small town sky fade from black to blue
And I’ll wipe the tear from my eye
But you’ll never know cause baby I’ll smile
As I wave goodbye to you

In the back seat of my car

Don't stop, darling they're just rain drops

Well, I took a good look at my life and decided I'd make a change

Learned a few chord from a fat-back, hairy man named Pete
I got a local gig on the weekends in some old honky-tonk
Singing two hours of nothing but Cash songs, and I could always drink for free
And some so called big-wig, producer man started sniffing around
He told me he liked my sound but there was something holding me back
He said a rhinestone suit and a cowboy hat outta do the trick
I told him I had something he could stick, way on up his a**

I wring the sheets out when I'm sweating,
Soaking wet, pacing, chasing the visions
And wishing that I could kiss,
Instead of missing you,
Yeah instead of missing you
Can't catch my breath, kinda feels like I'm suffocating, my mind's a wreck
At best, I think my heart is breaking down on me,
Breaking down on me

Oh, I, I,
I'm wondering where you are tonight
I, I, tell me will we ever get it right
I, I, I'm wondering where you are tonight

Can you feel me when I reach for you
Hear me when I say your name
See me walking through your door
Or are we just too far away
Too far away

Tell me when I'm out of sight, am I out of mind,
Do you count the seconds and minutes, just wanna speed up time
Girl, are you missing me all the ways I'm missing you,
Could you tell me how the hell I'm suppose to make it through?

Oh, I, I,
I'm wondering where you are tonight
I, I, tell me will we ever get it right
I, I, I'm wondering where you are tonight
(Wondering where you are tonight)

Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking,
Drinking and smoking and hoping
I wring the sheets out when I'm sweating,
Soaking wet, pacing, chasing the visions and wishing, yeah
Can't catch my breath, kinda feels like I'm suffocating, my mind's a wreck
At best, I think my heart is breaking down on me
Down on me

Kip Moore,"When a preacher talks of heaven, he paints it real nice
He says, you better get to livin', better get to livin' right
If you're gonna get your mansion, he's been saving for your soul
If you're gonna do your dancing on city streets of gold

But unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole
With a little piece of moonlight, a couple cans of Bud Light
Where I can cuddle with my baby and I can pull her real close
No, I don't wanna go unless heaven's got a dirt road

You better quit your drinking, you better quit your smoking too
Be for trading in your backseat Saturday nights for Sunday morning pew
Well, I've never been nothing, nothing more than what you see
Like my truck, I'm made for running, down to a midnight creek

So unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole
With a little piece of moonlight, a couple cans of Bud Light
Where I can cuddle with my baby and I can pull her real close
No, I don't wanna go unless heaven's got a dirt road

All of this flying high, gonna leave ya falling short
Leave you knock, knock, knocking on heaven's basement door
But one thing's for sure

Unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole

Kip Moore,"We was just kids, but she looked like a woman
Everything she was, was everything I wanted
We were both willing, but still a little guarded
She smiled that smile, that's where it all started

The two of us in the backseat
Lights off on a backstreet
I showed her and then she showed me
Right there, right there in the backseat
Yeah in the backseat

I flashed the headlights, she slipped out the back door
Didn't have to say nothing, we knew what we were in for
With every first kiss, I could feel her heart race
I'd fumble with the buttons while she was touching my face
What to do next, she knew that I didn't know
She'd smile and say, ""boy, make it up as you go""

The two of us in the backseat
Lights off on a backstreet
I showed her and then she showed me
Right there, right there in the backseat
Yeah in the backseat

If there’s a wrong road, I’m damn sure gonna take it

Where there’s blue lights, just read me my rights

No, they don’t make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ain’t gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, I’m to blame

Where there’s a love, I tell ya, girl, I love to hate it
Where there’s a do not touch, my finger print done stained it
Where there’s a train wreck, sit on back and watch me crash
Where there’s a what, you say, damn right I said it

No, they don’t make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ain’t gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger

For breaking your heart, taking this living a little too hard
Drinking too much and playing too loud, where there’s a scar I carved it out

And I know I make you cry
And I wish I knew the reason
But I don't know why
And you know all the things to do
To get under my skin when you want to
Girl, here we are, yeah we made it this far
With both hands on the wheel of a getaway car

Roll the window down, baby, wave goodbye
To your mama standin' there in the drive
From the day we met we were goin' too fast
We were born to run, we were built to last

All I know is sometimes you love it, sometimes you hate it
But what good's love if it ain't a little complicated?
No, it don't always go just like you hoped it would
But sometimes complicated's pretty damn good

Girl, you made your choice and you had your pick
Of a little bit smoother ride than this
Coulda played it safe, coulda got out clean
But you rolled the dice and you're stuck with me

No, it don't always go just like you hoped it would
But sometimes complicated's pretty damn good

Not much in the bank account
Just enough to get us by
So I'm scared as hell
The way you're smilin' at me
With those two pink lines

And all I know is sometimes you love it and you hate it

Kip Moore,"The boardwalk's empty, gray stole the blue from the sky
And ain't nobody watchin' the sun burnin' into the night
Nobody is hangin' 'round makin' out in the photo booth
Guess this old beach town burned out for me and you
I can see the smoke rolling off your lips
Feel my fingers runnin' through the belt loops on your hips
I guess you had to go, had other things in mind
Never thought you'd leave me behind

I see I was just another
Sunset fadin' in your eyes
I may never love another
But I had my girl of the summer

I can see your feet on my dash
Dark hair in the breeze
Hunger in the golden brown eyes staring holes through me
Grindin' through the gravel past the trains to that old junkyard
The things we uncover on top of those abandoned cars
I can feel the steel stickin' to my back
Feel the wind howlin' through the trains on the tracks

Countin' every star, crossin' every line
Always thinkin' that you'll be mine

I see I was just another
Sunset fadin' in your eyes
I may never love another
But I had my girl of the summer

Just last week saw a black jeep passing me by
Could have sworn it was your dark hair
Blowing out the passenger side
I did a double take, couldn't catch my breath
Felt just like a wrecking ball that hit me in the chest
It's like you disappeared, swept out in the tide
How'd you leave without a goodbye

I see I was just another
Sunset fadin' in your eyes
I may never love another
Like my girl of the summer

Yeah, yeah

Staring through the window at the empty cold
Thick white smoke rolling off my lips

My chest feeling heavy like a cannon ball
Got sweat rolling down me like a waterfall
'Cause I let love slip through my fingertips

Ooh, ooh
Hey, ah
I'm a raging fire, you're my hearts desire

Slipping in and out of a restless sleep
Thinking and wonderin' if you are thinking of me
Or are you long gone girl, holding another man

The thought brings me right up to the brink of rage
Like a lion in rusted out circus cage
I want to break these bars and make you understand

Ooh ooh,
Hey, ah
I'm a raging fire, you're my hearts desire

When I finally settle in to a midnight dream
You're walking through a field of flowers smiling at me
So I reach right out and try to touch your skin

Then a morning breeze blows and I almost taste your sweet scent drippin' on my pillow case
Damn this day, here I go again

Ooh ooh
Hey, ah
I'm a raging fire, you're my hearts desire

I don't think I can really take no more
Like a prize fighter laying on the canvas floor
I hear the clock bell ring struggle to my feet

I've been 52 rounds with your memory
I'd go 52 more if it make you see

Is that you'll disappear

Up to no good fun, no we didn't have much
Just a whole lotta time to burn

If there was a fire, we got it on
If there was a backseat, we made love

We crossed the county line for a kegger one night
There were some girls we had never seen
Teddy had his eye locked on a dime
Mary said she was lookin' at me
Standin' there sippin' on smoke
And a cheap ass bottle of rum
She said ""My name's Kate, you're my kinda crazy
And it takes one to know one""

So if we got high, we got stoned
If there was a fire, we got it on
If there was a backseat, we made love

With a boy with a checkered past
It wasn't long before he showed his true colors
And he left her all blue and black

With a loaded pistol and a bottle of booze
And it's a good damn thing the blue lights
Got us 'fore we did what we's gon' do

Time carried me
I searched the sky
I searched the sea

In your eyes another life
In your love another time
Heard you cry from the other side
In your eyes another life

The end came, promised jealousy
Took you away from me in the end
Life then, a rusting memory
I vowed that I would see you again

Ain't no mark on the beast
Ain't no second coming
Best to close your eyes and keep on running

Ain't know evil in the killer
Ain't no love in the saint
Ain't no use in saying there's no hope

Barely holding on to
Nothing

Ain't no life in the living
Ain't no death in the dying
Ain't no food in the bread
Starving ourselves, still we're overfed

Ain't no land of the free
Ain't no place left to breathe
Ain't nobody who is blessed
Just living the illusion that
We're not in such a mess

I walk this world of wonder
Waiting for a sign
Barely holding on to

The fading voices I use to trust
Have left me feeling cold
Is nothingness in all of us
Nothing left to hold

But I walk this world of wonder
Waiting for a sign only holding on to you

Ain't no truth in the lies
Ain't no tears in the cries
Burying the love as it dies
But I don't want to close my eyes
Looking for the strength when I'm weak
Looking for the faith when I seek
Don't wanna be day after day just living my life for

Look for the long lost pieces of your soul
Can you still hear them call

You're in there somewhere but you're barely alive
And you're not asking why
How long until the rest of you fades from your eyes
What has your world become

Running through circles you've spun through the years
Did you keep souvenirs
How many prayers fell on deaf ears
Until you gathered your heart in tears

You're out there somewhere but you're living a lie
Do you even know why
How long until the faces youre faking will die

Downtown Seattle
Nineteen
Runaway child
Floating over
A lifetime of hurting
Searching to make it all right

It's easy
All she wants is to know
A love that won't go
Pure as the midnight

Snow falling
Downtown in Jackson
She had to move on
The baby was due
And she needed
A magical moment
To wash away
Her last memories

It's easy
All she wants is to know

A love that wont go
A feeling Ive always known

Last seen
High in the desert
She joined a clan
Of mystical wanna-bes
But light shined
And the Seer was seen
So she closed her eyes
And dived back in a dream

It's easy
All she wants is to know
A love that wont go
She was the last one to know
But she don't let it show
A feeling I've always known",Runaway
Kipper Jones,"[Chorus: Latiff]
When I'm dippin on the grind I get my money quick
But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip
She be wit me cause she aint like all them other chicks
Let you hit, then she split, that's why I got a honey dip
From the club to the telly you know how it is
Most of the chicks I never tell em where a nigga live
Tryna reach me at my mansion or my mother crib
Hit my cell, hit my two, now I'm at my honey dips

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Yo we talked about 8, said I was comin thru to hit
Now its wee hours in the mornin and I'm drunker than a bitch
Stumblin and shit, I jumped up in the whip
Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip
And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo
Sizzurp wit the Cristal, the corners playin cee-lo
You see me well you jus smile you know we on the le-low
I'm whippin thru the town like we boilin up a kilo
Huh, I'm tryna dip up in the tele
Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli
My white t-shirt, lookin dip up in my Pelle
Smokin weed up in the Range
Full speed left lane
Its me against the world, M.O.B. up in my vein
Wit another nigga girl, gettin low to give me brain
If the bitch about the cause you aint gotta spit no game

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jr Writer]
You know I'm lookin for a honey dip
But I'm no dummy, most these bunnies
are money hungry and lookin for a money clip
So after the brother hit
I'll tell a honey dip
She won't see a contact, address nor buddy list
I aint on some hubby shit
That lovey dovey shit its nuttin trick I'm suttin slick you couldn't get
enough of it
How a slugger jus slide up thru the check in
Wit that linin on the Wesson
Hundred diamonds on my neck and wrist shit
I'm rich bitch, rhymings my profession
Watch how I do this stupid grindin and perfectin
Who's flyer when I step in got em spyin every second, cause that 06
Charger remind em of a 7
Yes man I'm so fresh the pro mess wit bread honey
My jeans 800, these are called Red Munkey
The flossin is gone, come talk to a Don fly enough to belong on a
catwalk in Mulan.....holla

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
I got me a lovely chick, I got me a slutty chick, I got em all, but my
favorite one is my honey dip
She get drunk wit me, roll the piff up wit me
Throw singles at other hoes in the strip club wit me
She do anything for jus one quicky
She a nympho chick
For this slow dick
She give no lip, she jus go get
The paper I ask her for, my bitch so quick
Plus she know every Santana song and she don't mind puttin the damn bandana on
Slap her ass tell her dance in this thong
She do it all for daddy
She move it all for daddy...Aye Aye
She get a brick and she boof it all for daddy
Hit the road shake the State Troopers off for daddy
And she bring all that paper back
No short paper back, she sure don't play wit that

Kippi Brannon,"Daddy, take me with you
I promise I'll be good
Daddy, it's next time
And Mama said I could

Sitting in the front seat
Riding downtown
For an ice cream cone
I'd wrap him around
My little fingers
Tighter than my baby curls

You can make a tear go
A long, long way when you're
Daddy's little girl
Walking down the isle
My eyes on Mr. Right

My bouquet was shaking
But Daddy held on tight
Taking those last steps
Daddy and me, from the child
To the woman I'd be

With a diamond on my finger
And my mama's string of pearls
He gave me away, 'cause I couldn't stay
Daddy's little girl

Well, he taught me my bible
From seven to thirteen
Taught me to drive
When I was a wild thing

I reached and he prayed
When I made some mistakes
That I wouldn't have made
If I'd've done it his way

Now he hugs me when he sees me
We talk about the past
He tries to give me money
And I try to give it back

He's a book of advice
More than I need
The look in his eyes
As he's saying to me

Let me help you while I can
While I'm still in this world
What will you do when your Daddy's gone
And you're Daddy's little girl

What'll I do when my daddy's gone

Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do

Kira Isabella,"It was Friday night and the lights were shinning
Everyone was sitting in the stands
He was being scouted by a big time college
She played trumpet in the marching band
In the parking lot, when the game was over
She had a bus to ride
When he pulled up in his buddy's truck
And the door swung open wide

He was the quarterback
Smile at her, imagine that
How do you explain the star of the game
And the no name girl from the freshman class

She got out at a bonfire party
Never had a drink before
But he held it to her lips and she took her first sip
And before she knew it, she had three more

She always heard that a girls first time,
Is a memory she'll never forget
She found out the hard way about love
When she saw those pictures on the internet

He was the quarterback
Smile at her, imagine that
Who you gonna blame the star of the game
Or the no name girl in the freshman class
He was the quarterback
Smile at her, imagine that
Who you gonna blame, the star of the game
Or the no name girl in the marching band

Oooh-Oooh

Monday morning when the word got out
Everybody picked a side
He had the school and the whole town too
And she had nothing but the truth inside

He was the quarterback
Smile at her, imagine that
Who you gonna blame, the star of the game
Or the no name girl in the freshman class
He was the quarterback
Lied to her, imagine that
He was the quarterback
She was in the freshman class
He was the quarterback

Who you gonna blame the star of the game
Or the no name girl in the freshman class",Quarterback

Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.

Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.

Full of butterflies inside.

Left behind a friend of mine

Her trench coat hangs inside her door

Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me

Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore

Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song

Never saw things going so right

All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Kiri Te Kanawa,"I've just finished writing an advertisement
Calling for a boy.
No half-hearted Romeo or flirt is meant;
That`s the kind I`d not employ.
Though anybody interested can apply,
He must know a thing or two to qualify.
For instance:

He must be able to dance.
He must make life a romance.
I said a boy wanted,
One who can smile;
Boy wanted, lovable style.

He must know how to say ""Yes!""
When I look at a new dress.
Oh, I`ll be ready when the right one calls,
And I`ll start vamping him until he falls;
Yes, if he proves to be the right little laddie,
I`ll make him glad he answered my ad.

He must like musical shows,
And he must wear snappy clothes.
Yes, that is my story,
And to it I`ll stick;
No glory
In having a hick.

He needn't be such a saint,
But, Oh! he doesn't say ""ain`t.""

That`s the kind I won`t employ.
Though anybody interested can apply,
He must know a thing to qualify.

To be the boy of my choice,
He`s got to own a Rolls Royce.
He must be quite reckless
Buying me things:
Pearl necklace,
Diamond rings.
He must be ready to pay
A dozen bills ev`ry day.
I`ll simply smothing him with tender care

So if you could seen one dining at the Savoy-oh!

I won`t have anyone small,
He must be handsome and tall.
I said a boy wanted,

Kiri Te Kanawa,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Are turning into thin air
And it seems that suddenly I've
Become the happiest girl alive

Things are looking up
I've been looking the landscape over
And it`s covered with four leaf clover
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

Bitter was my cup
But no more will I be the mourner
For I've certainly turned the corner
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

Every one beams
Just because of you

And my depression
Is unmistakably through

Kiri Te Kanawa,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka dots and moonbeams

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Kiri Te Kanawa,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.","I've got you under my skin, song (from the film ""Born to Dance"")"
Kiri Te Kanawa,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.","The song is you [Music in the Air, 1932]"
Kiri Te Kanawa,"They say that falling love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say","They Say It's Wonderful, song (from ""Annie Get your Gun"") [From Annie G"

But just give me a savior

Feeling kind of down
I called on my best friend
She could not be found
But I called on Jesus
My life He can hold

Over the hills and everywhere;

I seek both night and day;
I seek the lord to help me,

(Hey, it's me, Kirk, I need to speak to Bishop)
Sure, hold on

(Hello?) Hey, I got some stuff I need to talk to you about
Lately, pastor I've been having all these crazy kind of dreams
It's hard to sleep, I can't eat
Scary, you know (I know what you mean)
I mean, every since that Tuesday
Seems like life's just getting real strange (I hear ya)
Anthrax, terrorist attacks and
I ain't even trying to get on no plane (I feel ya)
And you know when I try to pray
There's a voice that telling that God's not real
(You know that's just the enemy)
Yea, but you ain't feeling me (No son, I know just know you feel)
(See, just because I preach and teach)
(Don't mean I don't get scared sometimes)
Yea, whatever, but you T.D. Jakes (Well, then I don't make mistakes)
Well (Now, let me tell you what's on my mind)

When your smile is gone (He cares)
Yea, but I feel so alone (He's there and)
Although, your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
See, but you don't know my (my pain)
And I'm getting so sick and tired of all (this rain)
I just got laid off, and to top it off the rent's due
So tell me what I got to gain?
Well, see, trials come to make (you strong)
Storms won't last (last long)
But how can I trust God in all this mess?
Well, see that's the reason for the song
See, wherever you go there's one thing ya got to know
God, is right there by your side (weeping may endure for a night)
And he told me to tell you everything
(Everything's goin' be alright)

So thank you for calling, it's always good to hear from you
(Yea, but) but I gotta go now
(Wait a minute) I got another call on line 2
(But I ain't through)

See I'm sick and tired of all these church folk
Talking about stuff ain't as bad as it seems
See, why'all don't feel my pain (I don't have pain?)
I don't see how, you on the cover on Time magazine
(See, but you're looking at now and you don't know how I struggled)
(And what I've been through)
Yea, whatever (Now, you crossed the line)
I'm just speakin' my mind (Okay so let me speak mine, too) (Hmmmmmm)
(I've made some mountains, I've seen some valleys)
(I've even had to cry sometimes)
(Like when I lost my mother)
Your mother? (my mother) I'm sorry (No son, that's fine)
(See life is full of ups and downs but God said)
*singer* the storm won't last long
But how'd you make it through? (Boy, I thought you knew)
(It was His) *singer* love that kept me strong

When your smile is gone (He cares)
But I feel so alone} (He's there and)
Although, your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
Yea, but see why'all don't feel (my pain)
And I'm getting very sick and tired of all this} (this rain)
Just got laid off, and to top it off the rent's due
So tell me, Bishop, what I gotta gain?
Didn't I tell you trials come to make (you strong)
And those old storms won't (last long)
How can I trust God in the midst of all this mess?
See that's the reason for this song
Wherever you go there's something ya got to know (God still cares)
(Weeping may endure for a night)
And he told me to tell you
(Everything's gon' be alright)

Thank you pastor (Any time)
I think I can make it now, just tell me what I need to do
(Just pray this prayer with me)

Say Father (Father) forgive me (forgive me)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry) please help me (help me)
I love You (I love You) I need You (I need You)
Hold me (hold me) Jesus (Jesus)
My heart (my heart) my soul (my soul)
Please take (please take) control (control)
Right now (Now) now
(Now) now (now) (right now)

When you ain't got no smile (He cares)
{And even when you feel so alone (He's there and)
Although your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
And even in the midst of all ya (pain)
And when you're sick and tired of all the rain (this rain)
Remember that the rain won't last always
And in Christ Jesus, you got so much to gain
You see your trials come to make you (strong)
And the storms won't last (too long)
Remember my brother, my sister, it's only temporary
See that's the reason for this song
Wherever you go there's something you've got to know
God is still there (weeping may endure for a night)
And He told me to tell you

Kirk Franklin,"So many different religions
And so many different churches
And if God really loves me
Then why does life keep hurting me?
Have you ever asked any of these questions?
Well my friend I've got the answer just listen

You have the power
To make the seasons change
The river flows for you
The wind whispers Your name
For me you left Your throne
And traded crown for thorns instead
I'm safe within not by Your skin
But because Your blood was red

Some say You're black, you're white
They question if you're real
We treat you like we treat ourselves
I wonder how you feel
To see your children fight in spite
of the tears for us you've shed
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

We may be different but
The God we serve's the same
Yet every Sunday we separate
And bring the Father pain
Your name is higher than any other
Yet You took my place instead
And now my sins are washed away
Because Your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red
Doesn't matter what color you are
As you are as long as your blood was red
Doesn't matter what color I am
As long as my blood was red",The Blood Song
Kirk Franklin,"When I close my eyes and think of you
And reminisce on all the things you do
I can't imagine my life without you
It's like paradise now I know that it's real (um)
It's a mystery for someone to give their life just for me
What you did on calvary
Makes me wann love you more

[Chorus]
I never knew I could be so happy
And I never knew I'd be so secure because of your love
Life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day

Never thought that I would smile again 
I never thought the dark clouds would end
Never thought the dark clouds would end
Never thought that I could have a friend
That would keep me never leave me alone (um)

The only one that makes my heart sing (heart sing)
Now I know what real love means
It's everlasting, lasting.

In a moment in a twinkling
Oh, He's gonna call my name (yes)
I'll be caught up in the twinkling of an eye (yes I will)

Kirk Franklin,"Why do you cry? He has risen.
Why are you weeping? He's not dead.
Why do you cry? he has risen.
Why are you weeping? He's not dead.
He paid it all on that lonely highway(hayyyy).
And his anointing I can feel.
He shed his blood (ohh ohh ohh).
For my transgressions (ohh ohh ohh).
And by his stripes we are healed.

Why do you cry? He has risen.
Why are you weeping? He's not dead.
So as you go through lifes journey(neeeee). Don't you worry lift up your head. Don't you cry (ohh ohh ohh) stop your weeping

Kirk Franklin,"You have the power to make the seasons change
The rivers flows for you the wind whispers your name
For me you left your throne and traded
Crown for thorns instead
I'm saved within not by your skin
But because your blood was red
We may be different but, the God we serve's the same
Every Sunday we separate, and bring the father pain
His name is: ""Higher than Any other""
But you took my place instead
It doesn't matter what color you are no Jesus
""As long as you're blood was red""
It reaches to the highest mountain
And it flows to the lowest valley
The blood that gives me strength
From day, to day
It will never lose it's power...",Outro (The Blood)
Kirk Franklin,"[Verse 1:]

What joy it brings
My soul can't wait
To see your face 
And I'll bless your name jesus 
When we get there

[Verse 2:]
You'll wipe my tears 
You'll say well done
You'll hold me close
And tell me I've overcome 
And you will exchange 
Joy for my pain
And I'll bless your name jesus
When we get there

Come on lets go 
We'll cry no more
We're gonna be just like jesus

Come on lets go

We're gonna be just like Jesus

This too shall pass
After a while
Scars will heal, you'll love again
It won't hurt you after a while

You pray and tried 
But still no end
God's purpose soon you'll understand
It won't hurt you after a while

Kirk Franklin,"Lord, I stand in Your presence
Wanting You and needing You
And I am here and I surrender
All of me so I can see

Your will is where I desire to be
Take all of me
All that I have and all that I do
I give it to You, Lord, it's for You

Just take my hand
And I'll follow You
For all that I am
And all that I do, it's for You

You are my song
It's Your love that keeps me strong
And You are the light
In the darkness of my night

I'm lost without You
Broken without You
Oh, how I need You
Oh, how I need You

You make life worth living
Your grace always keep giving

I'm lost without You
Broken without You
Oh, how I need You
Oh, how I need You

Lord, have mercy, Lord have mercy
Ooh, have mercy
We need Your healing
Please give us healing

Lord, have mercy
Have mercy
Lord, have mercy
Have mercy

Oh Lord, Lord, I come
Broken in this place
Weak and poor
For all I have is Yours, all Yours

This life, these things
They can't compare to You
No wealth, no fame can separate
The one my heart adores

Yet, we take our eyes off You
We're blind in reaching for the truth
And now this whole world cries
Because it realizes

There is none quite like You
The earth, the stars, the universe
They just repeat these words so true

Life begins and life will end with You
Hear me singing

When I die, what will they say about me?
Will the work that I've done
Be enough to help someone?
When I die, will I draw men's hearts to You?

At the setting of the sun
Wanna hear You say
Well done, when I die
Well done, well done

I know He will make me the spirit and the [Incomprehensible]

Kirk Franklin,"If I could I, I'd get away
Far from all this trouble I see everyday
Nobody wants to show their face
This life is like a, like a masquerade
I know you love me
I know you care
But while I'm hurting I just need to know your there
Watching over me and I feel your telling me

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Persecuted, pushed away, didn't think I'd live to see another day
Cried some tears and couldn't pray and when I'd try at times
I couldn't find the words to say, but now
I'm stronger, because of you without you Jesus I never could've made it through
Thank you for watching me loving me and telling me

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Life sometimes may change and nobody wants to feel pain,
But it came to help you grow and there's one thing you need to know
God's in love with you and he'll never let you go

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Disease in the land 
The hatred the killing taking lives from your hand 
Creation waits through the darkness we pray 
Tell me where is the hero to come and save

The fatherless son 
To the sick and the broken alone with no one 
Lift up you head your hope is on the way 
When we needed a hero you came and you saved the day

When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin 
Even though men deny 
You're the only sacrifice

Saying no to thoughts that try to control me
Remembering all you told me

Over what my mama said
And healed from what my daddy did
And I wanna live and not read that page again

Imagine me, being free, trusting you totally, finally I can

I admit it was hard to see
You being in love with someone like me
But finally I can

Being strong
And not letting people break me down
You won't get that joy this time around
Can you imagine me
In a world (in a world) where nobody has to live afraid?
Because of your love, fear's gone away
Can you imagine me?

Letting go of my past
And glad I have another chance
And my heart will dance

Kirk Franklin,"My mama gave me up when I was four years old
She didn't destroy my body but she killed my soul
Now it's cold 'cause I'm sleeping in my back seat
Understand the spirit's willing but my flesh is weak
Let me speak, I never had a chance to dream
Ten years old finding love in dirty magazines
Miss December you remember I bought you twice
Now I'm thirty plus and still paying the price
Had a sister that I barely knew
Kind of got separated by the age of two
Same mama different daddy so we couldn't fake it
I saw my sister's daddy beat her in the tub naked
Take it serious the demons in the man's mind
The same daddy with rape charges now he's doing time
Crack followed and like daddy prison thirteen years
Haven't her but she's traded tears for fears


Shout. Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
So come on
I'm talking to you
So come on

Sex was how I made it through
Without someone to teach you love what else is there to do?
So where I'm from they call you gay and say you ain't a man
Show them you ain't no punk
Get all the girls you can
A simple plan that still haunts me even now today
Back to seventeen and got a baby on the way
No G.E.D. all I see is failure in my eyes
If you listening then remember I apologize
I was raised falling in the church
Made mistakes heard the Lord's calling in the church
After service on the parking lot getting high
Wanted to be accepted so bad I was willing to die
Even tried to tell the pastor but he couldn't see
Years of low self esteem and insecurities
Church taught me how to shout and how to speak in tongues
But preacher teach me how to live now when the tongue is done, help me

See I'm. See I'm
Soul surviver. Soul survivor
World survivor
I just wanna let it go
World survivor, soul survivor
Just wanna let it go

Jesus please on my knees can't you hear my crying
You said to put it in your hands and lord I'm really trying
You wasn't lying when you said you'd reap what you sow
Like that night mama died
Hard to let it go
You adopted me
Cared for me
And changed my name
But I cursed at you
Lied to you
Left your pain
It's not strange I can still see it in my head
To know for hours you were laying in that bed
If you listening to this record,
If it's day our night
If my mama still living treat your mama right
Don't be like me and let that moment slip away
And be careful cause you can't take back what you say
To my real mama if you listening I'm letting it go
To my father I forgive you 'cause you didn't know
The pain was preparation for my destiny
And one more thing lord let my son be a better man than me",Let It Go
Kirk Franklin,"I refuse to be another black statistic
A black man who can wine and dine in the sin of the world and still be considered a christian 
I plan on being great
I care not to be less
I refuse to wear a bar code across my chest 
I refuse to let a black tee or throwback jersey define me
I refuse to let my children witness divorce 
Or make mature decisions in court
I refuse to grow up carrying the generational curse
I refuse to feel the need to curse in my verse
I hate being automatically looked at when someone asks can anyone rap
I wanna be a black man that can flip it from urban to corporate measures 
A black man who doesn't gain knowledge from the world for his own pleasures
A black man who reps Christ to the fullest with no regrets
My only regret is the stigma that many black statistics in the past have set
Like going to jail, bragging about bail, leaving our kids, cussing at church,
Married and you still flirt, no father present at birth
Animosity within the ministers of our church
I refuse to let my people be viewed as temporary
I plan on planting a seed not for the moment but for one that's legendary
As for statistics
My father broke the mode
And I feel its my job for the next generation to continue in it
Because I refuse to be another black statistic",Outro
