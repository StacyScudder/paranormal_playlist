Babybird," 
I got this no good, deadwood
motherfucking itch
and I am going to hell
they got this small pen, fat pig
2 foot by one and it's beginning to smell

i got this low brow, white trash smoking my tongue and i'm being kissed like a kid
they got this hi-fi, big sound
bleeding my ears and I can't get rid

i got the life
i never thought
that i'd be born with
but now i'm itching
for you to scratch me
like all the records
that your needle has worn

i got a six pack, big ship no deck kid
who couldn't write when he sung
he took a mic in his hand like a prick on a rope and waited there to be swung

they got this big light white wash spot on his tan and watched it burning his skin
and then the hi-fi white trash smoking my ear
got his face kicked in

i got the life
i never thought
that i'd be born with
but now i'm itching
for you to scratch me
like all the records
that your needle has worn

with the screen round my face
covered in light I will never go blind
i got this cable satellite nibbling my eyes
but i can't switch off my mind
i got this low brow white trash licking my skull
and it feels so good
it's got this big pull, half full little buzz
that i've misunderstood

I got the life
I never thought
that I'd be born with
but now I'm itching
for you to scratch me
like all the records
that your needle has worn 
",The Life
Babybird,"We are not cool
We are not crazy
We steal cars
Because we're lazy
We are not risky
We are not bad
We burn down houses
Just to make us sad
I'm too handsome to be homeless
We are not famous
We are not known
We break into hotels
Just to feel at home
We cannot read
We cannot write
We makeout in cars
Then we set them alight
I'm too handsome to be homeless
We die for pleasure
We kill for fun
We give you children
But we won't make you come
Hug your wives
Kiss your sons
Corkscrew your fingers
Round our no-good tongues

Babyface,"You've been hanging out without your girlfriends
And they've been hanging out at all the clubs
And you've been making eyes at all their boyfriends
Have I complained? Not even once

So tell me how can you
Expect me to be cool
While you're playing silly games with my love
Darlin' I won't accept you
Putting blame on me
You know that I'm the innocent one

Now haven't I been faithful
Haven't I been true
But you're not even grateful
Hey, what's a guy to do

You've been talking to your ex-girlfriends
They're always calling you up on the phone
Yet you insist they really don't mean nothing
Then tell me why can't you just leave them alone

Time after time
I guess that's just life
Feelings we can't express
We only hide
Deep down inside

Who needs another sad affair
Girl, if we care
We'll end it right here
We could be lovers
If we'd only share
All that we feel
But we must be sincere

I know we've been
Been here so many times before
But don't you think
Think that our love's worth fighting for

If we try
Just one time, oh baby
If we try
Then I'll know we'll get by

Our love is gentle
It's give and take
It's all about the vows we make
Whether we honor them
With love and trust
It's all up to us

That you're running out of time

You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend

You for having faith in me

Till my dying day
And it really makes me feel good

Still cares for me, baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
And no matter what I do
I promise that I'll keep on
Loving you, pretty baby

Does that love disappear

They didn't help

Babyface,"I was born on the northside of a
Midwestern town
There was nine of us living in a
Three bedroom house

Didn't have much money, but we made do
'Cause Momma worked all day long
And daddy did too
Did all they could

Made sure we had clothes and food
Went to public schools and we
Followed public rules
We used second hand books, but oh

I didn't mind the books
Momma taught us early in life, everybody's gotta
Struggle sometime

Bring back those simple times of yesterday
When a man was a man
And a friend was a friend
Bring back those simple times of yesterday
When you said what you meant
And you menat what you said 

Had a friend named Bobby
Who always kept his word
We went through schoolyard fights
Had a thing for pretty girls

Didn't cost much money to
See the picture show
So we hopped the bus into town
That's where all the girlies used to go

Fifty cents would buy us popcorn for two
'Cause Bobby's girl, she worked there and
Sometimes she's break the rules
Picnics in the summer

Wouldn't wake up 'till noon
And even though Bobby's gone now
I can still hear him laugh
In the middle of June

Sometime the only thing a brother need
He need the strength from his queen

I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', done 'bout
run out of time
The only time I want to do right now
Is feel you by my side

Hear me darlin', hear me darlin'
I can't be more sincere
The only thing that's gonna get me through
Is if I got you right here

Well I said everything's gonna be all right
When you stand by my side
Gonna work things out tonight
We're gonna make out just fine
For once I'd like for you to be
The one who has the faith in me
And I promise I won't
let you down this time

Babyface,"Check it
Word is bond
Yeah, Face

I will love you any way, baby
Any way and every way I can
'Cause I'm that kind of man, yes

I will give you everything, baby
Give you more than any girl can stand
I'm gonna love you baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm talking 'bout makin' love in the shower at least an hour
And let you dangle in my arms 'cause love is power
Can you feel it? The sky's the limit once you reveal it
Your heart was wounded, God sent me to heal it

On a mission, ain't no stress, love
Touch you with precision, just undress, love
I know the right position, come on, trust me girl
Throw this rock up on your hand, I'll give you the world

Hey yo, Face
On the real
Was the honey looking laced
Oh, baby baby baby

This is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever

I will love you all the way, baby
Girl that means this love will never end
I'll be your lover and your friend

I will take you anywhere, baby
Just say when and girl I'll take you there
I'm gonna take you baby, baby, baby, baby

We're going from Tahiti to France, to Italy in one night
Drop top Bentley coupe parked in the spotlight
And you can drive it laced in all white
I'm wearin' triple black, our gear is top flight

Trips to Venice, the man of steel when I'm in this
A match made in heaven when we blend this
Lovers everlasting, in other words endless
To love any other man would be senseless

Hey yo, Face
On the real
Was the honey looking laced
Oh, baby baby baby

This is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever

Ladies and gentlemen, Howard Hewett

I can say I never met a girl, no no
Who satisfied my mental and physical thing
When I lay me down to sleep, I rest assured
With the thought that you are right, right next to me

This is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever

It's for the lover in you, baby
With this ring I'll show you there ain't no maybe
It's for the lover in you, baby
This time it's gonna last forever

It's for the lover in you, baby
It's for the lover in you, baby
This time it's gonna last forever

If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear I love you now and then

About the love that you make to me
And I can't get you outta my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away

And I can't stop carin' about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the center of my life

You won't see me again

And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die

And I can't stop doin' without
Without the rhythm of my heart
No I can't stop doin' without
For I would surely fall apart

And I got excited, I cried all day
And you were such a lovely, precious sight
When I saw our baby in your eyes

It was like falling deep in love
I heard the angels cry above
I felt a blessing straight from God
The day that you gave me a son 

I called 'bout everyone I knew
Just think, I'll be a father 'cause of you
There's no greater love than what you gave
A brand new baby on the way 

[Chorus:]
Oh such tears of joy, I've never known
I can't remember
It's like a song, I've never heard
I've never sung, but know the words

I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never
Say good-bye

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

[Chorus]
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever
You and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you? just come back to me

(lonely)
Yes baby my heart is lonely

My heart hurts baby

And sometimes it's wrong
And sometimes it's right

Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
But if you're searching for

A place you know a familiar face
Somewhere to go
You should search inside yourself
And you're halfway there

Sometimes you'll laugh and sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us the when's or why's
But when you've got friends to wish you well
You'll find a point when you will exhale

She was oh so beautiful 
But she's not here anymore 
She had a college degree 
Smart as anyone could be 
She had so much to live for 
But she fell in love 
With the wrong kinda man 

He abused her love and treated her so bad 
There was not enough education in her world

It's not right, it's so wrong 
Do we let it just go on

Wake up, for it's too late 
Right now, we can't wait

Open up your hearts 
As well as your eyes 
She tried to give a cry for help 
She even blamed things on herself 
But no one came to her aid 
Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell 
That's what we'd like to tell ourselves 

But no, it wasn't that way 
So she fell in love 
With the wrong kinda man 
And she paid with her life 
For loving that man 
So we cannot ignore, 
We must look for the signs 
And maybe next time we could save somebody's life","How Come, How Long"

Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

On the real was the honey looking laced

[Chorus]
This is for the lover in you
This ring  means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time's gonna last forever

I will love you all the way baby
Girl, that means this love will never end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'll take you anywhere baby
Just say when and girl I'll take you there
I'm gonna take you baby, baby, baby

We're going from Tahiti to France to Italy in one night
Drop top Bentley Coupe parked in the spotlight
And you can drive it laced in all white
I'm wearing triple black, a Gear's top flight
Trips to Venice the man a steel when a menace
A match made in heaven when we blend this
Lovers everlasting in other words endless
To love any other man would be senseless in yor face
On the real was the honey looking laced?

[Chorus]

Ladies and gentlemen, Howard Hewitt
I can say I never met a girl, no, no
Who satisfied my mental and my physical thing
When I lay me down to sleep 
I rest assured with the thought
That you are right, right next to me

[Chorus]

It's for the lover in you, baby
With this ring I'll show you there ain't no maybe
It's for the lover in you baby. oh, yeah, yeah
Oh this time's it's gonna last forever, and ever, baby
It's for the lover in you, baby, baby, baby

And this time's it's gonna last forever",This Is for the Lover in You
Babyface,"So many years that you sacrificed
So many chances you let go by
And girl never once did
you complain, no way
And now he's got nerve just to criticize
You let yourself go, like you've got no pride
You do what you do hoping he will stay
The first thing you do is put on your make up
But he doesn't notice a thing
It's not how it's s'posed to be

When men grow old
Do they lose sensitivity
When men grow old
They forget how to love
When men grow old
They have no sense of loyalty
Well if that's how it is
I don't want to grow anymore

So many nights when you sat alone
He's out with his friends like he's got no home
But you understood that he needed his space
But now it seems like that he's always gone
And he won't admit that
there's something wrong
He finds a young girl who will take your place
The first thing you do,
you go get your hair done
But he doesn't notice a thing
It's not supposed to be that way

[Hook]
Time after time
Year after year
So many women are drowning in tears
Waiting and hoping and praying for love
Something that most men don't
know the true meaning of
Why can't they just open their hearts,
don't they fall in love

[Hook]",When Men Grow Old
Babyface,"We started out simple friends
That kind of friendship never ends, no baby
But we were fortunate to care enough
We knew just where we stood
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love would stray

Where, where will you go
And who, who's gonna love you like I do
Where, where will you go
And who's gonna love like I do

What kind of friends could we have been
If we had kept the feelings in
When we had made a vow to be the friends
We were since we began
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

How can you be sure that things are better?

I told her there was no one in particular
There's just I, myself, and me
I told her that I dream of you quite often
She just cut her eyes at me
She said you got a home, you're very happy
So just stop your meddling

Well girl I'm not alright

Are you for real (So lonely)
Do you still think of me (I think of you)
Baby still (Are you lonely)
Do you dream of me at night (Like I dream of you all the time)
So let me tell you how it feels (Its like everyday I die)
Wish I was dreaming but its real (When I open up my eyes)
Let me tell you how it feels (And don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love again

I miss your face
I miss your kiss
I even miss the arguments
That we would have from time to time
I miss you standing by my side

Babyface,"Back in the day when I was younger.
I fell in love about every summer.
And I would be calling up the radio.
To dedicate my favorite song to her.
And I sung along with everything.
The words in the song, they spoke to me.
Now I need to know, where did the music go.
Cause my heart is crying out.

I need a love song about now.
Don't need no ring tone songs now.
Please tell the DJ, slow it down.
I wanna think about my baby now.
I want a old school type of slow jam.
You know the kinda where they used to romance.
When Luther used to sing like 'baby'
And Michael made the world go crazy.
I need a 12-play, two step, kelly kinda record (Oh)
I need a love song right now.

(Oh. c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)

Back in the day when I got older.
The music in me had taken over.
So I wrote the songs that made the lovers dance.
Like ""I'll Make Love"" and ""Breathe Again""
Now I want to know, where love has been.
Its just not the same, as it was back then.
And the world needs to fall in love again.
Cause my heart is crying out.

I need a love song about now.
Don't need no ring tone songs now.

Remember when we used to slow dance.
And everybody used to electric-slide.
We'd be partying the whole night.
And we took it home,oh baby.
Rock the boat to the radio, don't ya' know, I miss it all right now.
Cause my heart is crying out.

That you have chosen me, yes
That every night before I close my eyes
I thank god that I'm me
To know that you love me
To know that you care
To know that you give up yourself and yet still ask of nothing
From me

Your love is exceptional
Born of a heart of gold
It fills me up to my soul
Then my cup, it overflows
You're my sunshine all day, all night
For always, for all time, baby
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional, so exceptional

Every night when I lie next to you
I lay in disbelief
That I'm worthy of deserving you
That I get to live this dream, babe
To know that you want me
Is to know that I'm here
To know that I live in your heart is to know that I'm blessed
And it's clear

Your love is exceptional
Born of a heart of gold, yes it is

You can wait for me little girl
But I won't be coming this way again

Ah, the wind blowing in proud as the trees upon the plain
And a stranger's voice talked to me of liberty and freedom
Yeah, it seems like he done gone wrong again
And he wears the hat like shame

Well he tasted the fruit of another
And when his Margie, when she discovered
Said she's gonna love him ten times more
Ain't nobody's business if she do

But they're rich in other ways""

Gone are the peaceful days,

We'll live for love somewhere in paradise together.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love

I know your love will see me through somehow

All of the heartache you've ever know 
And when the tears seem to come so easy

Approached me in his saloon and asked me to sit down

Was I unemployed or would I like a job
He said he owned the stage line and there were men who liked to rob 

He offered me his daughter's hand, an advance of salary
A fancy gun, a pair of boots, and a share in the company

Now I ride shotgun on his stage line
I ride shotgun on his life
I ride shotgun on his money
I ride shotgun on his wife

There were outlaws who waited on the trail
For the stagecoach daily run with payrolls and the mail

They spied our dust, and saddled up to ride
They saw the worried driver with me sittin' at his side

So they circled 'round the stagecoach it was their daily fun
Until they saw the driver smile and spied my trusty gun

We caught the outlaws and took them back to jail
Sent for the county marshal and would not post a bail

Sent 'em up the river. 
That sure cleaned up the town
I was elected sheriff.

Tú ibas para allá
Yo iba para acá
Y fue tan bonito verte cruzar
Al menos por un ratito por mi camino

Carito el corazón
Me queda grande
Cuando yo pienso en ti, yo siento pasos de gigante
Carito esta canción,

Ahí delante, ahí delante, ahí delante, estás ahí delante

Baby is crazy 'bout me

Mr. Cupid was our teacher
That's the reason we agree
I'm crazy 'bout my baby

Never let the money and these broads break us

We act a fool cause the laws make us
Baby, you can't stop the hustle'

You walk your ass 'cross my yard, get off my grass
You want to get to that money, get off yo' ass
You wants to know my name, you wants to ask
If you want to see me for something, it's going cost ya cash
I see ya poking outcha jeans girl you acting bad
Oh, do that again with you nasty ass
I caught her coming out the mall, with 2 or 3 bags
Now shorty got her at the wood shack, throwing her back
Champagne, chicken wings, and bubble bath
Catch me somewhere outta town signing autographs
Still working street corners, straight serving them blacks
Them thirty-two fifth it for four and a half
I prefer a Chevrolet, when it's time to mash
And I smoke the 'dro weed, a hundred dollars a sack
I put up the big numbers nigga, check the stats
And I'm on the microphone with Gipp, Slimm, and Cass

Since the trashman only run once a week
If I miss it, I'm wait 'til night and dump it up the street,
behind the Winn-Dixie
Quiver, never step or kept up his penny drawers
To get an applause, appeared to have no flaws
In the situation, no dentition, smelling good
But I ain't gonna feel her, touching up would be too easy
 
Sleazy, measly, looking ugly like a person trying to sell me a dub
Fool A, see, D, and me
Trees ain't my reason for sending your ass to grave and
Watch you say the grade is,
Burn like acid reflux, somebone'll order up the Pheffer chickens
While I order up a smoked duck (Thank You)
Get the gas to go, at the corner sto'
Keep my hand on the nine piece
In case somebody want to disturb the peace (Always keeping my eyes open)
Cause you, can't, stop the hustle

Well I'm known for my shine, Southside
Eyes on the prize, it's Mr. Fly Guy
Mobbing, '68 Chevy, door vault ties
Jumped out mugging like I'm holding twenty pies
Rocked up, work on the block,
We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight
Let Juke lick the plate, I re-rock the shape
Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake
Got gorillas with banana clips, who love to go apes
Southpaw, side-strapped, known to leave yellow tape
Try and stop the hustle and crushed like grapes
Just for the taste, just for the taste

You know dem days, it's in the scarfs

Backside Slappy,"Stand up you're on your own tonight
It's the last time that you lie awake in bed all night with no direction, 
Your direction's out the door 
Let's go, let's go, let's go

You've found your way tonight out the door into the moon-lit night. 
The stars are shining in your eyes, and there's miles to go
That's why you've said your goodbyes, now you're after more than you know. 
Destination anywhere, I swear it won't be long before...

Stand up you're on your own tonight this is your life.[Repeat] 

You're miles away, miles away from everything you've left behind, 
Nothing seems to matter now,
You've said your goodbyes to all of your regrets and second chances, failed attempts. 
Suddenly it all makes sense, this is your chance to say, ""Screw it all""

Stand up you're on your own tonight this is your life.[Repeat]

It starts tonight, this is your chance, make it worth your dying breath. 
This town ain't big enough for you

Stand up you're on your own tonight this is your life.[Repeat]

Your direction's out the door, let's go, let's go.[Repeat x 4]",Destination Anywhere

I could tell when I stepped in the room

Caught in a vibe by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There was some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me to you (lead me to you)

And I was hypnotized

Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?

I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listenin' to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away

Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?

And how you got me blind is still a mystery 
I can't get you out of my head 
Don't care what is written in your history 
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are 
Where you're from 
What you did 
As long as you love me 
Who you are 
Where you're from 
Don't care what you did 
As long as you love me 

Every little thing that you have said and done 
Feels like it's deep within me 
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run 
It seems like we're meant to be 

Chorus 

Bridge: 
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows 
But I guess it shows 
When you look into my eyes 
What you did and where you are comin' from 
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.

Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know

Just how to walk without your hands

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would
Always be there
I want to thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

I wanna share my dreams 
Baby together, oh

Riding her bike through alphabet city

Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise
She said ""what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?""

That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day

Right alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor until the camera made us

What's up with those tears in your eyes
What happened when you shut down,
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine

Remember when we used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you’d put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

Hold on, don’t let go
Hold on and you’ll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Let the sunshine warm your heart today
So rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty

Not everyone will know what's ahead
How could you know that I was sad
'Cause little did you know what you had

There was a time when I was young and blind
Could not see 'cause of my one tracked mind
There was a time when I was betting high
Too many things to do before we die

You're playing hide and seek
What you find is yours and always to keep
Revolution ain't for the weak
Don't double cross a river too deep

Too many things to do before we die

Always a beginning and always an end
But not very often anything in between

How can I make it on time
There seems to be no reason no rhyme
Can you face another day
When you have nothing left to do or to say

Could not see 'cause of my one tracked mind

But the fire is so delightful

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbying

Livin' they life as a ghetto star, you know (worldwide)

[Verse 1]
You know those days when you hear the lord calling you
But you don't respond 'cuz you ballin' and your all in two
Your ghetto star lifestyles, big houses and cars
Million dollar phone calls to bad bitches and all
A nigga don't make five bucks to spend before he come up
Sippin' out this half a pint bout to light up this blunt
Just reminicin' bout past years, deaths and tears
So many fallin' peers I'd never though I'd see these years
Swallowin' my tank of beer hope the rain hide the tears
Pray to God I ain't scared, if they bust , hide and hit
And if they come fightin' shit I won't believe it cuz I'm low
I'm a child of God and keep mashin' for whats good to me
You should recognize game when it's all in your face
Would you choose to lie and die mamed so you fall on your face
But I refuse to lose so I ball in my space

I hear the penitentiary callin'
Live my life straight ballin'
I hear lord Jesus callin'
Ghetto Star, Ghetto Star

[Verse 2]
I invented my own lifestyle from crumbs and dope
Fuck shattered dreams there's fatter things that come from hope
You heard 'em holla ""keep ya head up""
I ask God to help us out
The world's caught a plague and everybody's weapons out
Shoot first, and never get to the ask questions part
When we blast testin' marks you ain't fit to live a day here
Best to keep your heat and hold your post you wanna stay here
It sure ain't worth askin' why I stay so high
You don't irritate my mind
And I ain't got time if it ain't about a dime
The fat pace, crack chase, played out with ces
It's getting rich with Low Life's and's it's put on my chest
And fuck a high speed chase, gettin' laced with slugs
And stuck steppin' off a plane duct taped with drugs
I'm trying to live my life to the fullest extent
You crossed my clique noe you know what them bullets just meant
We keep it hittin' hard bangin' corners bouncin' up the boulevard
Smokin' somethin', niggas dumpin' hollerin' bout ""life is hard""
Just cause we ride to live, mean somethin' gotta give
I don't care who you are, live like a ghetto star
Life is only one time, that's why we hate one-time
Tryin' to live my life, my life under the sunshine
That's why I live, when they get deep I hold my breath
And here's my only reply when he asks me 'bout death
I said, ""I never could picture me dead,
Could only see my life is lavish and obviously
I can get it so I gotta have it""
And you can live your life forever scarred
But I'ma ball 'till I'm gone livin' life as a ghetto star
Bentley coups, mini mansions like Snoop
And watch full of rocks, million dollar speed boats, yachts
All the time I got. is spent on some hood shit
Pray when I see the break of day on some good shit
Hit the liquor store to get some blunts for the dope
Man if I ain't high, can't cope
God help us
You hope to hear us holler his name
He know we stuck in all this sea and chasin dollars and fame
When will it end
The pain and the pressures of life come at once
And the only remedy is some drinks mixed with blunts
The lord knows what goes on behind closed doors
And it's tewntey five to life with those ho's with gold ?bows?
Catch you at your momma's hose slippin'
Gang bangers from the game we ride when it's time for dippin'
Kill the cops, fuck they law, they ain't arresting me
Life is jail without bars and ghetto star is my destiny

The homies on deck with the heaters behind us
Wide up, so bonafied up
This ain't that same ol' shit you get tired of
The heat for the street from the best suppliers
(West and Eastside up, Eastsidaz)

[Goldie Loc]
Now this is dedicated to hoo-bangin', slangin'
Catch heat from this motherfuckin' dirty rap game
I won't tell you nothin', that you might have been told
I won't sell you nothin', that you might have had bought
Just fuck wit cha nigga cause I stay low gold
Quick to blast moms and pops and the dog To-to
You don't know me nigga, so keep my name out your grill
If I see you on the streets I'm just gon' keep it way real
They know again, keepin' that shit gangsta cuhz
I got my head on straight, with my brain on buzz
Trust a slug, when it slip the AK's flip
Squeezin' on the trigger yellin' Rollin' 20 Crip
Walkin' through the shadow of death, I see my shadow on my left
Grip tight with the heat on my right
Will I make it through these fucked up situations?
I'm headed to Dogghouse, so D's paper chasin' (motherfucker)

[Chorus]
Dogghouse niggaz, we ridaz
We always got a car load of bitches beside us
You punk motherfuckers want to try and divide us

Gotta get mine (gotta get miiiine)
Runnin' out of time (runnin' out of tiiime)
Gotta get mine (gotta get miiiine)
Runnin' out of time (runnin' out of tiiiiiiime)

[Bad Azz talikng]
All the motherfuckers who tellin' it's alright now
Ey,nothin' can stop us from doing our motherfuckin' thing
God dammit

[Verse 1]
From sunrise to sunset,one life one God
The universe and the rear out to the blocks they don't care about
Seein' hope till every hood fill with hopelessness
And hopelessness is enough to get the hustle back crackin'
Now you can tell the story to your friends back home
Back home they missin' ""back"" 'cause a nigga been gone
So long,to all the homies that God called before me
Now without y'all here me and the homies gettin' lonely
Wonderin' who gon' the next to experience death
It get deep around here,fo' real hold your breath
Just thinkin' about ya lookin' at the stars as they glistenin'
It's hard to put the puzzle together with pieces missin'
In the places where the love is gone with no traces
Tryin' to eat of sellin' drugs,we goin' from catchin' cases upstate
To our concrete wars with sad faces and the freedom costs more
Than a House so we ain't sleepin'
I'm stuck tryin' to touch me a buck and can't grind
'cause they ate us and the punk one time
I keep it strapped at the homegirls spot
If we get hot we get bad and give 'em all we got
We hittin' back,think twice about bringin' your gat
To where we at we nuthin' nice when it come to all that
And fuck a fight I'm too much in love with life
And gettin' cash and I don't know how long it's gon' last
You understand

[Chorus]
Gotta get yourz,gotta get mine
We gotta hurry,'fore we run outta time
Yo,as addition I'll be outta my line
I'm lovin' my life
Too much to be wastin' my time
Gotta get yourz,gotta get mine
We gotta hurry,'fore we run outta time
Yo,as addition I'll be outta my line
I'm lovin' my life
Too much to be wastin' my time
I'm on the grind

[Verse 2]
Just drinkin' this hot wine and dealin' with hard times
And keepin' my feet in shoes the horrible keepin' loose
It only shows me bad what happens ain't somethin' good
They funny 'cause it's the money what happen off in the hood
They replaced the love with hate in different (?)
I tried to smell 'em and liked 'em and tried though again
Pills is equals(?) ???? where we goin' from here
Is what you showin' me ??? I only do what I fear
I got love for real niggaz from here to over there
All my Long Beach niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
All my Jersey niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
You can feel 'cause I'm real and I'm killin' just to live
With my New York niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
All my Georgia niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
All my Texas niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
And Arizona they be killin' just to live
What!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From a helpless child to a hopeless man
I got bait that's overshadowed in this hopeless land
When money splits friends apart and broken hearts cause
Guns to spark when we pray it don't start
They say it's all bad but it's not,you see it's all good
When it could be that's really how it should be
It would be real (?) instead of (?) help each other to live
Knowin' how hard it is all of this is dedicated to y'all for life
One Love,my niggaz get ya Thug on
It's a real cold to have to kill Just to live
And these Long Beach streets ain't really made for the kids
It's a real cold game to have to slang just to eat
In the lowdown shang(?) you got that thang just to sleep
See niggaz like me we be real enough to feel
You can feel me 'cause I'm real and I kill you just to live

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
California niggaz we be killin' just to live
'cause Chicago niggaz they keep it real enough to feel
All my Oregon niggaz the ones who killin' just to live
'cause Loiusianna niggaz keep it real
What about my Michigan niggaz the ones who killin' just to live
'cause in Arkansas they keep it real enough to feel
Down in Florida y'all they keep it real enough to feel
Out in Vegas they be killin' just to live
What!

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz talking]
Imagine that,we got the whole world out here killin' just to live
That's a goddamn shame,you gotta get yourz I gotta get mine
Put a rush on it 'cause we runnin' outta time
Ain't no time to waste,ain't no time to procrastinate
You better get on the good foot right now yeah,'cause later might be too late
Yeah we on a mad mission,take me up out of this bitch",Get Yourz Now
Bad Azz,"Purple, yeah, it's Dogghouse why y'all

[Bad Azz: x2]
See me, I be about my dollars
In my own world, wit my own girls popping collars
I'ma G, we, be up for the Impalas
Wit the juice, getting loose on why y'all, I make ya holla

[Bad Azz]
I make ya feel like ya drunk, you on a gallon of strong gin
What's happening, it's a party cracking up in my play pen
The play pen party is popping, it's strait line up
It's an after Aftermath party and my bed's smelly bottom
Oh you gone, I see real weird 'til it's over
When we leave, we goin' peel out in the limo wit the chauffeur
Wit the doja, gat, Congnac and some soda, (c'mon, see man)

[Kola]
Who make 'em chat? Angels rule the world
Who make these niggas want to leave their girl? (Kola, Kola!)
Who got the turk to the dirt? Throwing nose and dope
Got niggas cumming from the lyrics I quar (Kola, Kola!)
Dogghouse checking niggas with the switch in their walk
Niggas would talk, slept wit my, leave 'em in chalk
Keep it pimping (truly!) Got 'em screaming (ooh wee!)
Angels 'with B-A-D A-Z-Z!

[Chorus: LaToya Williams]
(oh, oh, oh, oh) How we get down
(oh oh, oh, oh) This is how we get down
(oh, oh, oh, oh) How we get down
(oh oh, oh, oh) This is how we get down

[Bad Azz]
Money talks, nigga bullshit, run a marathon
Gotta have bread, every month, every cent, every blunt
Every single bottle of 'gnac, you could shine
It ain't no thing, show your paper stack (check it out)
Money makes girls, take bitches, make niggas
Take money by the motherfucking gun
See I'ma gangsta from the East side, the L.B.C.
I wouldn't do it if it wasn't no fun (c'mon)
Oh you gone? I see it real weird 'til it's over
Where you at? We still smoking and this is Conyiac

[Conyiac]
It's only one way, Dogghouse is doing movies
Fun stack to unlimited, riches with intentions
Regulate every aspect of the game
(Brain loose, sipping purple smoke)
That got me and Angels choked out (no doubt)
They formally stampeded like Kurk (have some party's)
Step up wit quiet and I could get us
Rep the 'boes, sticking clicks, sick dumbs never holla
I be out, thugged out, then follow, make 'em swallow

[Chorus: x2]

[Bad Azz]
Three, two, one, it's at the NFL like the thing just begun
I'm fucked up, I can't believe I'm still looking at butts
I can't quit, I'm off the hizzle with this kinda shit
It's goin' be all away, done before we trying to split
When it's this kinda party, we always act dope
Now you all doped up and you think ya mad dope
Gotcha homegirls talking to you, glasses of, damn
I done, drank all my 'gnac and Cola, whats up Chan?

[Big Chan]
Know I, not tap, no hats, nothing but hand claps
Slap the pistol cause my holsters snap, and dudes get snapped
Time to act up, and I could definitely dig that
We got's to get paid to snitches masses, my decision is made
Why y'all bought, why y'all paid
We be fiends, everywhere, the Angels are back
Hold that, so let it go and put the bang-bang
That's how we doing the damn thing (damn thing)

[Chorus: x4]",How We Get Down
Bad Azz,"(Bad Azz talking)
I hear everybody say they put they heart into they music
Blessed with the time, I want to share this piece of my life with y'all
I mean all y'all
I dedicate this to the whole wide world
And everybody who's in love with life, feel me, you know what I mean
(Life is full of hard times and then you die)

I gotta thank God for real life 'cause man invented violent death
My generation's in love with sin, I want to live
I want to see some more kids, Martini, stress, a little head
'Cause my son ain't here and only God cures fears
Ain't no woman 'bout a dollar, 'cause what we need, we got it
Even God gave it to us, so one of his people bought it
See change, that's ??? ??? favor this time
He sent the angel to sprinkle some flavor on this rhyme
Sent the poor folks, rice, chicken wings and hope
And for Christmas all the kids got brand new coats
I got a letter from my uncle in jail, he said he love us
Ain't no life in this hell, and only friend is God above us
I told him 'hold on', Pac said 'life goes on'
And what's the price of freedom, if they was wrong we could teach 'em
Damn, you don't know the strength of together
We in the house of smiles if outside this bad weather 'til the sun comes

(Chorus)
In the ghetto we hang all day, play all night
Gotta give thanks for life
In the ghetto it's on all day (it's on), just keep it tight
In the ghetto we hang all day, play all night
We gotta give thanks for life
In the ghetto it's on all day (it's on), just keep it tight

I gotta thank God when I wake up and pray before I go to sleep
And hustle all day, 'cause life ain't cheap
The cost of living is an arm and a leg, so crawl around
Tryna' eat and get back on your feet
If you could sleep, you could try this everyday of the week 'til you deceased
You could sacrifice your life to see peace, with all the grief
Can't buy you a minute of sleep, so stay up
Smoke a blunt and get drunk, like us, don't give a fuck
Thugged out all night, 'til the sun come up
Ridin doubles on a bike, probably playin with my life
Sayin 'that's the police' when we see some headlights
They dead right when they tell you that life ain't long
But keep it tight, and it'll be aight
And I don't lie about nothin, know the truth about me, I be for real
If I lie, you don't know how I feel
It's hard to love the place
somethin you ain't never had the structure to feel

(Chorus)

Before I go I want to leave this here, with your acceptance
This experience here, has really sharpened my perception
And I'd love to stay, but we all gotta go
Take ya patience, it's a while before you reach ya destination
It's a lot of love here, it's just mixed with all the hate
And I been waitin, I ain't seen no fallin stars or no comet
I was lookin for a sign he said 'I'm it'
I hit the blunt and dumped the ashes and told the homeboys 'stop it'
What gangstas gotta do as saviors and prophets
Nothin, ain't no connection at all
Except the fact that we created by the All Mighty God
That ain't enough to stand up and clap your hands for this song
'Ain't no supportin Him by myself, I can't stand up for the cause'
Damn, you don't know the strength of together
Didn't wonder when they talked about the power in numbers
I'm the ghetto and I love the hood, what you wonder

(Chorus) 2x",It's on All Day
Bad Azz,"[Chorus: Blaqthoven]
Life, Life ain't hard, but it ain't easy, damn sure ain't easy hey
Life, Life ain't hard, but it ain't easy, damn sure ain't easy hey

[Bad Azz]
The world built like a jail, Long Beach ain't nothing but a cell
Today's paper read, Four injured, Two killed that's real
Life ain't getting no longer, Let's get it popping here
Really though, Just like the song is
In life, it ain't nothing I fear
With young rapper got millionaires stealing my lyrics
That's the truth, In all of this essence
And what's a few Gs? Please when you're rich with more blessings
I don't trip, What comes around, goes around again
Like I own the car of the trunk that they found you in
And ain't no telling like Jack told Helen
They'll sell you a key, but not to open the door to heaven
You was talking to the judge, when it could have been the Reverend
Tell him, you should have been free, it could have been me
What would it have tooked for us to see that life ain't easy
Believe me

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
Life will throw you a job, know you've been robbed
And purposely leave you, stuck when you're down on your luck
Life will lock you in the cell, praying to heaven just to get out of hell
It seems to be to me it ain't no way out
Life will break a nigga, picking up the pieces, ain't the easiest
I wake up every day just knowing there some Gs to get the gang
Cop a few, watch out for the obstacles
 
Tripping off the politics
Wondering what the cops is doing and they just chilling there and lock me up
My homie was scared, he from them, and they just shot him up
He didn't die, but he cried through the stress
and that's a real hard way to learn a lesson
Yes, indeed it hurts to bleed
You've gotta be as strong as Hercules to deal with this
and don't get killed with this
Cause you know that'll hurt ya mothers heart
and where do we go after we done torn our earth apart singing

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
I'm just here, trying to maintain
I let the good times be the medicine for the pain cause life's a headache
I have you bed sick or even dead quick
Cause doctor said to think straight, you need you're head kicked
Left the hospital with stitches, walk and feel like its over like
What could be worse then the police pull us over
Resist the trip and ask the cops
Why you stopping us? Shouldn't you been looking for the trench coat mafia?
He say we look like the type to blast and get popular
Na, we love life more than that, and God's watchin us
It's hard enough for what's up, like for having nigga ? up
Living out his truck
And some times it hurts to live
Doing all this work to live, just to die
I hope my life is justified
I know I'm breathing for a reason, maybe even a purpose
So don't live like you're life is worthless

[Chorus: x2]",Life Ain't Hard
Bad Azz,"[Bad Azz]
California's just a dope spot
Home where people sleepin' with they dope locked
Crack spot, jackpot, rob you with a black glock
Cash in my stash, bought my last on a 'Llac drop
It's that, somethin' old school with a ragtop
We tall cans, and tattoos
You smoke weed, we match you
With tank tops, Levi's, and house shoes
We in the alley or the front on the curb
We in the city with the cavi or the valley with the herb
We just the home of gang bangin', keepin' one off in the chamber
County time, and everyday it's on the grind
We got the ghetto bird, sheriff's, and the sea shores
The earthquakes, but that ain't what you packin' heat for
That's for the rowdy 2000 cowboys
Like down South they 'bout it, the heat make a loud noise
The swap meet's and hoodrats, they reside here
The good - and even young die here

[Chorus]
Life ain't never what it really seems to be
All I want to do is just fulfill my destiny
(Sometimes it might get rough, but sometimes it ain't never enough
 it all depends on how you hustle)
Life ain't never what it really seems to be
All I want to do is just fulfill my destiny
(Sometimes it might get rough, but sometimes it ain't never enough

[Bad Azz]
Man, the Beach is still a motherfucker
Man, the game ain't changed a bit
It's still - rock for rock, it's still pounds to flip
It's still - low lifes with the hammer cocked
And you chill, before you find your life half a block
from the spot that I pulled this and shot at that bullshit
You talkin', I'll pull quick and turn the light out in your house
It's on, cause if it ain't, it's grown
Might have to bank that Brougham that's on them Dayton's, that's to make a getaway
We known to start a riot, we ain't home if it's quiet
We wired, we never sleep, and we rarely get tired
We on fire, I wil' out and clap that ass up
You heard of Juvenile bitch, ""Back That Azz Up""
c'mon!, get with it, jump on it and hit a corner with me
I'm on one 'til God come and get me - feel me?
Cause ain't too many niggaz thuggin' like this though
You buggin' like you ate a couple slugs from my pistol

[Chorus]
Life ain't never what it really seems to be
All I want to do is just fulfill my destiny
 (Sometimes it might get rough, but sometimes it ain't never enough
  it all depends on how you hustle)

All I want to do is just fulfill my destiny
 (Sometimes it might get rough, but sometimes it ain't never enough

[Bad Azz]
Everythang ain't made for everybody
I feel it ain't me if it ain't real
It ain't bangin' like this - I ain't finna write shit 
It ain't the Low Life Gang, I don't too much hang
I'm 'bout my money and my cash flow
Saggin' my Dickies, rockin' my afro
Four or five gats in the 'Llac, follow the Astro
I'm thug luv, every night is a club
And L.A.'s a playground when you fuckin' with us
(Check it out) My homie asked me could I get him some head
I hooked him up with a bad bitch he slept in the bed with
And that's just a small thang to a giant
You'll be amazed what your brain could do, if you just try it
If you don't want it, don't buy it
If you gon' suck it, don't bite it
And if you got the feelin', don't fight it
Too many choices make a nigga confused
So find somethin' to do before your life is through

[Chorus] - X 2.5
Life ain't never what it really seems to be
All I want to do is just fulfill my destiny
 (Sometimes it might get rough, but sometimes it ain't never enough

A nigga feel so low that I can't come up
Dippin down the 101 blazin smoke
A trunk full of beats for why'all to go

[Bad Azz]
Kurupt, Snoop, let's do the damn thing
Show all the little homies how the Dogg Pound bang

[Snoop Dogg]
Dash, fast, the upper class
Went from low life to a brother with cash

[Bad Azz]
Spending all of my time and like half my cash
Went from smoking dimes to smoking mafia bags
Went from sometimes to smoking all in the bath
And Lord knows I might host the Weed Award Show

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm looking for the 105 getting off the 405
Be with this bad bitch, she living in the south
I'm met her at the club with my nigga Gotti
5-3, thick, with a lot of pride

[Kurupt (Snoop Dogg)]
That's what I love about the homes (What's that?)
Its just like a nigga getting trained, the homie spittin game
This shit makes no sense
I'm trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents

[Bad Azz]
Money and funny niggas don't mix at all
And Cali's the perfect whether to get your chips and ball
So you can touch it while you're here or die without
I'd rather have it, since it really don't matter

The world spin around much longer
They thought that the West Coast leave
But we still be float
Mo' money 2 fold
Nigga ice cold
Mo' money 2 fold

A G is a G which we all know
A bitch is a bitch as a hoes a hoe
Watch as I strut these, cousin, I'ma bank æem bank æem
Dammit, it feels good, gangsta

[Bad Azz]
Its three gangstas in a Cadillac
With TV's, CD's, some weed and three weeks
Chucks and French braids, blunts and gold chains
Hats and white T's, fag acts like police

[Snoop Dogg]
When we on the East Coast we get nothing but love
All up in the club, DJ holla'd out who we was
I looked around, seen some MC's and grabbed the mic
And then I lit they ass up to keep the party on the high

[Kurupt (Bad Azz)]
Hit me on the Motorola holla at the homie
What's up sitting down sipping a Corona (What's up Kurupt!)
About to dip through, blaze up a quarter
 
Ounce, bounce with the homies and make the tour bounce

[Bad Azz]
I like my Hennesey with Coke, I like my weed chronic smoke
I like my, Gin straight, my Benjamin's big faced 
My women get big face, my niggas get big lace
Big homes and big Bentley's coup and star chrome

[Snoop Dogg]
We rolling through the wild wild west
No respect to the click, who keeps it so dick
Most niggas probably want to bust us or even duck us
But the thing is we doing the right thing so you niggas can't touch us

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
I been no one fuck a little bit give me a lot 
I want a steak not an 8-gun on a block
I want a skyscraper, not no apartment building
And I want billions in case I got part with millions

[Kurupt]
In case anybody ain't reach the top, that's cause they ain't deserve to
Now shut the fuck up before I get my guns out
And I ain't playing no games
So check a nigga I ain't sayin no names

[Snoop Dogg]
How move it, who I move, but that's what they want
But they just can't see me, I slide up on 'em
Nigga that don't work his shit up off a coke
Work that bitch from a corner into a comba, nigga ya want to?

[Kurupt]
Dipping down the block where all the homies at
Fleetwoods and Lax on the homies straps
Nigga I rise for the hood home boy
What up Dogg, it all ain't good home boy

Like we said before, your face to the floor

And don't nobody get up til we hit the door

[Verse 1]
This here life of mine down this one way street
So unpredictable, tryin' to run into a Dollar
Drama all I seem to get into, can't rewind time
So the problems that's mine, is either solve 'em
Or deal with 'em tomorrow, can't borrow, ain't got a job
Money ain't circulatin', cops had the spot dropped
So it ain't no work in yay, What's up?
I'm thinkin' 'Damn, I need a Dollar'
I feel stuck and the hard times make me want to holla
God help me out here, oh no I'm with my last
Knowin' I can be the next to die, gone with the pass that
I don't want to feel like real life's hard to live
Fake 'cause when they do me, ay, this ain't no movie
Ain't no take too, you ever think about where your
Life goin' take you? ain't you grateful to be alive
Or you want to die 'cause life hates you, don't let it take you
Or make you or break you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, the game a get ya, hit ya hard and make ya fall
And you get broke with no hope and, no get back
Let's try hard to see success and not the stress and get there
You stay persistent long enough, you probably have shit where
Everything you need'll be exactly where it need to be
 
To me the streets and peace are never seen in 
See really forgot about the kids doin' what we did
Part of gettin' high watchin' time go by
Now they want to smoke and drink and ride on by
Catch a case, be at their pace and it's a long cold ride
Judge just gave Shorty Mack 1-0-5 and I doubt he'll live
To be a hundred and thirty three, they try to tellin' me he gon' die
Yo, in the penitentiary, he mentioned he needed me to send him a 
Package, I'ma shoot it to ya, man I know the game'll do it to ya
Yes it will like that, like that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
For me, it's been a long time comin' with a stretch up in here
I ain't scared but I don't want to be dead
I caught the game tryin' to kill me and found out it's been
Several attempts, it hurts to know this shit gettin' so personal
At once, don't they know you can't do nothin' about it
Least you know the world'll never be crowded
The same thing that'll make you laugh'll make you cry
The same game that got you rich will make you die
Fuck the truth, we like livin' in a lie, it ain't no time
To try to find my lost mind, I'm on the grind, I got rent
I need nickels and dimes would I be sent and life be as a
Personal business, sell your service not your soul
If you ain't got no dough, Nah I ain't tellin' and try to go
And try to sell your brain, if you ain't got you a scale
And a barreler cane, I'm just sayin' got to use what you got
To, do what you want and most folks don't
I gotta handle mine, you better

[Verse 1]
Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
I'm often traffic tryin' to get it 'cause a nigga gotta eat
We can holla if it's 'bout fillin' my plate
I feel like killin' somebody when a nigga ain't late
It's about weight,when you workin' smart shit it don't flip right
Put the wrong ties and dees it won't slip right
Get the wrong blunt for the weed it won't hit right
And money don't grow on trees so what I look like
Make moves,can't lose if I do it that way
Fuck a fight,ain't nobody fin' to put they gat away
That's fast lane,lil' kids here to blow your head away
Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
Who got the cell phones for sale,who got it crackin' with the heat
Who got the club with the top shop and parks for cars
The Ese homies do the paint and body shop in the yard
Who got the hook-up with the burned out 2 way pagers
Can you give me a vest or a infrared laser
See me,I'm just a smart brother everything made for

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Holla at a playa when you see me on the streets
I'm often traffic tryin' to get it 'cause a nigga gotta eat
We can holla if it's 'bout fillin' my plate
I feel like killin' somebody when a nigga ain't late
It's about weight,fuck a few ki's move freight
And you doublin' your money if you take it upstate
Once you outta town get the prices on the pound
Shoot the number to your boy have him come on down
With a few of those who know money like y'all
All Lakers say is ""Damn,y'all niggaz is ballin""
y'all back callin' all shots round here
Used to have to bring two Glocks round here
It's about five different gangs and the cops round here
And today Long Beach's about as crazy as it is
And maybe we'll live,every ever even see it
Believe it and how they get money ain't no secret
But they gon' try to keep it from you when they see you
Learn to keep on movin' you gon' see the tables keep on turnin'
First I was destined with no paper and no hoes
Now I got bitches in the show biz glow
So holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
Don't let the green grab fool you tryin' to test me with some heat
'cause bye bye you outta here,gone see you later

A nigga either broke or he ball
And me, I smoke til I choke and I cough, drink til I barf
Sometimes I ain't thinkin' at all
But I don't pray to take my eyes of why'all

What I'm going do, what I'm going be
If I have to please you and I don't please me
I got too many choices, too many choices
What I'm going do, what I'm going be
If I have to please you and I don't please me
I got too many choices, too many choices

?
I've been so many places, still I don't know where I want to be
People forever changing, rearranging, I see things
I gotta go, don't want to know your name
Cause your life, is none like
But I want you to know before I go, that baby, we could've had it all
We could've had it all

[Bad Azz]
Just to be alive is a blessing to me
Hey, you can lose your mind and heavy stress moving
Recently, I've been talking to myself a lot
I answer back, thinking 'I ain't supposed to answer that'
Is that a fact? Am I losing it for what I said?
Or is it 'cause a nigga talking and ain't no one there
I can't remember 'cause I'm scared, I don't look back
It's hell behind me and I ain't trying get took back
I know you feel me, stressing, learning lessons of life
Till they kill me, and we'll be, alright in the long run
Maybe mix son gin with my life 'cause we all gone crazy
And maybe, we'd learn to maintain
It'd help us stay sane, for the time we remain
Or maybe, the rest of the world'd lose they mind
And we'd die not knowing how we wasted perfect time
Damn, (we could've had it all)

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil' Beau]
I'm on top of the world and about it
Yeah, it don't make sense, only chase for sex and presidents
Probably next on the set but I check myself quick
My old homies want to get me (fuck why y'all), the devil want to hit me
Flashing cash that like ? on ass
Giving into greed, doing dirty deeds for the last time
I swore to God it was, but I lie
I try to stay clean but clocking green made the Holy Ghost die
That's why B.T. banging now, that's why bigets is slanging 'round
It's 'cause we don't know how, to stay sane in this game
Having chips and then they took away, it's just another face of pain
And while I got a couple bitches try and dirty up my name
Getting served by a couple hoes, gobble up the game, going crazy
And still grind sales in this paying-the-world game
But I choke, it ain't nobody fall but Lil' Beau
Tell the tag on my toe and nigga mourn what he here for
Friends be the snakes in disguise so I fear for 'em
Knowing Jesus watching all my homies and my kinfolk
Guide me the right way, you'll pay for ? yourself, yeah

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil' Tip Toe]
I wake up early in the morning everyday, when the sun rise
Just praying for the world to come together before my son rise
And get old, and have to go through life without a daddy
Just because your Caddy came through with a barrel pointed at me
Life is short to being happy, so I live with smiles and hugs
But some folks, they rather trip to spitting rounds of slugs
I keep it real for those that choose to learn game from me
I'd probably blast myself before you'd ever see a change in me
I'm going crazy out here, God help me if you will
I try to keep it real, on my journey up the hill for a mil
But still, I got too many choices to make
And while Tha Lowlifes rising to the top they hoping we brake
Lil' Tip'll never fall without a reason from God
You will never fall without a reason from God
(I got too many choices, too many choices, we could've had it all)

Tangled in teenage mum at the movies
Your voice ran out out of words
It was awkward and homey

Gospel in your belly, they aim a little lower
Back into the bleachers, Spoke as it's owner
Sindicate a sermon you sang from the raptors
Anchors in you pockets, holding down the laughter

Tearing up your mind, your lust and your ego
Slingshot a martyr to speed your libido
Perish grows to jelly, blissful and wasted

You built them burned to bridge
And scattered all your crumbs at the cliff

Thunder clap's arising, I think that I should
Go home

To the days when, back barns, it melts me
Nineteen-ninety-six and your waiting there to tell me
I didn't die, you dreamt it, you dreamt it
I'm as alive as your backward intentions
Sorry that I tricked you, you had to focus
Put yourself together, clear out, you got this

I want you by my side
Girl I'm doing it for you
I'm gonna open your eyes
I'm gonna take you higher(higher higher higher)
Than a bird can fly
Girl I'm so in love with you
Don't even think that it is true",This Is Home
