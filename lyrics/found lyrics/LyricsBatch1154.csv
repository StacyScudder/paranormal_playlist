Scissor Sisters,"Once there was a man,
Who had a little too much,
Time on his hands,
He never stopped to think,
That he was getting older.
When his night came to an end,
He tried to grasp for his last friend,
And pretend,
That he could wish himself health,
On a four-leaf clover.

He said is this the Return to Oz?
The grass is dead
The gold is brown
And the sky has claws.
there's a wind-up man
Walking round and round.
What once was Emerald City's
Now a Crystal Town

It's three o'clock in the morning,
You get a phone call
From the queen with a hundred heads
She says that they're all dead
She tried the last one on
It couldn't speak, fell off
And now she just wanders the halls
Thinking nothing
Thinking nothing at all

She says is this the Return to Oz?
The grass is dead
The gold is brown
And the sky has claws.
there's a wind-up man
Walking round and round.
What once was Emerald City's
Now a Crystal Town

The wheelies are cutting pavement
And the Skeksis at the rave met
To hide deep inside
Their sunken faces
And their wild rolling eyes
But their callous words reveal
That they can no longer feel
Love or sex appeal
The patchwork girl has come to cinch the deal

To return to Oz
We've fled the world
With smiles and clenching jaws
Please help me friend from coming down
I've lost my place and now it can't be found
Is this the Return to Oz?
The grass is dead
The gold is brown
And the sky has claws.
there's a wind-up man
Walking round and round.
What once was Emerald City's
Now a Crystal Town",Return to Oz

Scissor Sisters,"When you grow up, livin' like a good boy oughta
And your mama, takes a shine to her best son
Something different, all the girls they seem to like you
Cause you're handsome, like to talk and a whole lot of fun

But now your girl's gone a missin'
And your house has got an empty bed
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
They won't listen to a word you said

Gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut

Do it 
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt that we're doing oh the best we can
We're gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late 'cause baby you're a full grown man

It's a struggle, livin' like a good boy oughta
In the summer, watchin' all the girls pass by
When your mama, heard the way that you'd been talking
I tried to tell you, that all she'd want to do is cry

Now we end up takin' the long way home
Lookin' overdressed wearin' buckets of stale cologne
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
When your glasses in the garbage
And your Continental's just got towed",Take Your Mama [Video]
Scissor Sisters,"I love the tone that's in your laugh
Gasping for an extra breath
Waiting for the time to pass
I believe in days ahead
Don't spend another night alone
Cross and wishing you were dead

Mary, you shouldn't let 'em make you mad
You hold the best you can
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man

I've had it easy now you see
When I'm down you're always there
Standing by to comfort me
Someday we'll go round the world
I'll make the journey so sublime
I know you're not a travelin' girl

Mary, you shouldn't let 'em make you mad
You hold the best you can
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man

Cause I'd give everything I have
Forget all the things that bring me joy
If you could have one day
Pure and simple happiness
Until that moment comes
I'll be here where I've always been
I'm gonna be your friend
Until the day I die

You hold the best you can
And Mary, after all the pain is gone

Scissor Sisters,"Wake up in the morning with a head like 'What ya done?'
This used to be the life but I don't need another one
Good luck cuttin' nothin', carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

So I play along when I hear that favorite song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You better know when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like magic's solely yours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with the one in bed till dawn with you, you, you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colors make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clapped your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that you'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one if I can't get down with you, you, you

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer light

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?

Scissor Sisters,"I've been a movie star 
Confused by the film 
A plot too complicated for me 
Played the policeman 
'Cause he knows the drill 
He's got to beat the competition away 

Ambition, oh so dirty 
Keep smiling, and know that they'll never know 
Ambition ain't so pretty 
That knocking'll open up another door 

I've got the cravin' 
And you've got it too 
It's just an old fashioned kind of position 
Sweet aspiration 
There's no more time 
What's the sense in hanging on when you ain't mine 

Give me attention 
Be my divine 
We may be different creatures but we're pink inside 

I am a moving car 
With wishes for wheels 
Driving at the speed of dissention 
How you're connected 
Is how you can feel 
What accomplishment can do for contention 

Ambition, oh so dirty 
Keep smiling, and know that they'll never know 
Ambition ain't so pretty 
That knocking'll open up another door 

I've climbed to heaven 
And you'll be there too 
It's just an old timer incarceration 
Grey night oppression 
What do you say 
When you look the other way it ain't me 

Give me attention 
Be my divine 
We may be different creatures but we're pink inside",Ambition
Scissor Sisters,"If you're waiting for your wings but you just got legs
And you're feeding all your chickens but they won't lay eggs
When you open up your drawers and see your janky clothes
Just remember life's in love with you but let's suppose
That God ain't gonna drop you no hundred dollar bill
You're got to question your intentions
'Cause the bad ones kill

Everybody wants the same thing
Everybody wants the same thing
No trading places on the chain gang
It doesn't matter how you swing it
Everybody wants the same thing

When your exit sign is coming could be 'round any bend
Now did you live your life proper did you just pretend
That you knew what you were talking about
Which side was your fence
When the hammer comes down it never makes no sense
Chaos is not a virtue, paranoia loads the bases
Just imagine giant rivers overflowing with their faces

Everybody wants the same thing
Everybody wants the same thing
No trading places on the chain gang
It doesn't matter how you swing it
Everybody wants the same thing

What is it that you want?
What is it that you give?
Where do you plan on finding it?
How do you want to live?

What is it that you want?
What is it that you give?
Where do you plan on finding it?
How do you want to live?

What is it that you want?
What is it that you give?
Where do you plan on finding it?
How do you want to live?

Love is what I want
Love is what I give
Right here's where I'm finding it
That's how I'm gonna live

Love is what I want
Love is what I give
Right here's where I'm finding it
That's how I'm gonna live

Love is what I want

Scissor Sisters,"It's not easy having yourself a good time
Greasing up those bets and betters
Watching out they don't four-letter
F**k and kiss you both at the same time
Smells like something I've forgotten
Curled up died and now it's rotten

I'm not a gangster tonight
Don't wanna be a bad guy
I'm just a loner baby
And now you've gotten in my way

I can't decide
Whether you should live or die
Oh, you'll probably go to heaven
Please don't hang your head and cry
No wonder why
My heart feels dead inside
It's cold and hard and petrified
Lock the doors and close the blinds
We're going for a ride

It's a b**ch convincing people to like you
If I stop now call me a quitter
If lies were cats you'd be a litter
Pleasing everyone isn't like you
Dancing jigs until I'm crippled
Slug ten drinks I won't get pickled

I've got to hand it to you
You've played by all the same rules
It takes the truth to fool me
And now you've made me angry

I can't decide
Whether you should live or die
Oh, you'll probably go to heaven
Please don't hang your head and cry
No wonder why
My heart feels dead inside
It's cold and hard and petrified
Lock the doors and close the blinds
We're going for a ride

Oh, I could throw you in the lake
Or feed you poisoned birthday cake
I won't deny I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
Oh, I could bury you alive
But you might crawl out with a knife
And kill me when I'm sleeping
That's why

I can't decide
Whether you should live or die
Oh, you'll probably go to heaven
Please don't hang your head and cry

Scissor Sisters,"When you're standing on the side of a hill
Feeling like you didn't be done
Here it comes, strawberry sponge
Chasing away the sun

Don't let those precious moments fool you
Happiness is getting you down
A rainbow never smiles or blinks
It's just a candy colored frown

You were going on at half-past seven
Now it's going on a quarter 'til nine
All the angels want to know
Are you lost or treading water?
And you're going on your fifteenth bender
But you've only got a matter of time
Yes we've all got seeds to sow
Not everyone's got lambs to slaughter

When the night wind starts to turn
Into the ocean breeze
And the dew drops sting and burn
Like angry honey bees
That is when you hear the song falling from the sky
Happy yesterday to all
We were born to die

Sometimes you're filled with the notion
The afterlife's a moment away
You want to tell someone the way that you feel
But then you ain't got nothing to say
You fight for freedom from devotion
A battle that will always begin
With somebody giving you a piece of advice;
By the way you're living in sin

Now there's never gonna' be an intermission
But there'll always be a closing night
Never entertain those visions
Lest you may have packed your baggages
First impressions are cheap ambitions
Sometimes are long goodbyes
Truth so often to living dormant
Good luck walks and bullshit flies

When the headlights guide your way
You know the place is right
When the treetops sing and sway
Don't go to sleep tonight
That is when you see the sign
Luminous and high:
Tomorrow's not what it used to be
We were born to die
Happy yesterday to all
We were born to die",Intermission

Do what you want 'cause it's your own sky
Just call me when the phone stops ringing
Thanks for coming by
I'm just glad I'm on your good side
Where it's smoldering you're freezing
It's never all that easy to decide

This is the land of a thousand words
But it seems so few are worth the breath to say
Sit doubting looking after my own worth
And you just keep on saving the day
I'll try to stay but it's in vain when you're far
I'm on the run to wherever you are

And that's the nature of the chase
You fall so far behind you end in first place
Pass the torch this time we're running to each's own regret
There's no harm in playing hard to get

Can't hide the holes in your eyes or cover up that bitter smile

When you cut the lights out think of me
When you cut the lights out think of all the things you can't see
But are they real?

Nobody's callin' that payphone in your mind
I wonder just what they find but that line's busy all the time

Scissor Sisters,"When you're quiet, but your eyes
Are saying everything I need to know
I want to burrow like a sparrow
Dodging alley cats and whiskers
Why do we talk in whispers?
Is it painful hearing voices ring
So early in the morning?

I've been waiting for the day
When I can throw away these numbers
That line my dresser drawers and cupboards
Start me over
Life seems so much slower
With your toothbrush by the mirror
Can I make it any clearer?

And I just might say it tonight
I just might say it tonight
And I just might tell you tonight
That I love you
And you should stay all my life

They'll tell you that you'll maybe make it
If you just cut your clothes and change your hair
But I won't fuss and moan
'bout what you wear
I feel so much better
When I read your dirty letters
Just wear your sweaters in the winter
'Cause I wouldn't want you to get cold
I hope that we're together when we're old
I would have sold all my possessions
Never took piano lessons
But baby you're a grand
And I will learn to play the good notes
And tune you up the best I can

There's an urgency I'm feeling for the first time
It's all mine
Do we dream about each other at the same time?
All night
This might be the only way to talk to you
That's right
It's your ears with the sound that I walk into
Your mind

Is it the party that ain't over 'til it's through?
Is it the wiring that's suddenly blown a fuse?
Is it a chemical that makes this moment true?
Is it the music that connects me to you?

There's a way to get together then I'm gone away
One day
It's a place that all that matters are the notes you play
I say
Simple pleasures when I'm listening it gets me by
Won't lie
When you're singing I'll be with you 'til the exit time
We shine

Is it the party that ain't over 'til it's through?
Is it the wiring that's suddenly a blown fuse?
Is it a chemical that makes this moment true?
Is it the music that connects me to you?
To you-hoo!

Here I was awaiting
Praying for the muse
I'm finally awake and you have
Left me less confused
Maybe now
You will hear me now
I'm just in love
In love with your sound

Is it the party that ain't over 'til it's through?
Is it the wiring that's suddenly a blown fuse?

It rains like Revelations
Gonna wash these freaks away
Some girls wanna hold your hand
And some girls like to pray
Well my girl takes her drinks 
With dust and rusty razor blades

As I lie between these covers
I wanna tell her that I love it
When she chokes me in the
Backseat of her riverboat 'cause

She's my man
And we got all the balls we need
When you taste that pavement
You're amazed
She smells your sympathy
So bye bye ladies
May the best queen hold the crown
For the most bush sold on the levee
My my, how word gets around
She strangles for a good time
And she kills my self-control
She's my man, don't be too sad sonny
'Cause she'll never be your woman no more

Someday soon, this dank lagoon's 
Gonna sink right into hell
They'll hide you from Big Ida
At the Sho' Enough Hotel
The Ladies of the evening's just
A tombstone in your bed
Well my girl eats a wounded preacher
'tween two loaves of bread

I know she's up to something
But how can I run when she's just
Keel-hauled twenty-on to nothing
I'll stay next to the steel coal oven 'cause

She's my man
And we got all the balls we need
When you taste that pavement
You're amazed
She smells your sympathy
So bye bye ladies
May the best queen hold the crown
For the most bush sold on the levee
My my, how word gets around
She strangles for a good time
And she kills my self-control
She's my man, don't be too sad sonny
'Cause she'll never be your woman no more

All you need's just a fist of a tear-stained bunny
When the good ship comes to town
Who said loves a bitch'll sit next to me honey
Because this old boat's gonna run aground
Cause I don't want to be the burden
Or your jealous bastard
I don't wanna be the Tarzan of your next epic disaster

She's my man
And we got all the balls we need
When you taste that pavement
You're amazed
She smells your sympathy
So bye bye ladies
May the best queen hold the crown
For the most bush sold on the levee
My my, how word gets around
She strangles for a good time
And she kills my self-control
She's my man, don't be too sad sonny
'Cause she'll never be your woman no more

She's my man, can't you feel her comin'
She's my man, she's gonna keep you runnin'
She's my man, she's gonna teach you something
She's me, she's my man

From every direction
And love was just something you found
To add to your collection

It used to seem we were number one
But now it sounds so far away
I had a dream we were running from
Some blazing arrows yesterday

You said, fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire

Now the city blacks out the sun
That you know is rising
You can show me the work that you've done
Your fears have been disguising
Is it just me or is everyone
Hiding out between the lines
What will we be when we come undone
Just a simple meeting of the minds?

And we'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire

Underneath your skies
There's a million lights
Burning brightly just like fireflies

It's cold and heaven surrounds you from every direction
Cause there's someone behind every hand
That you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one
The morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on
And tomorrow has become today, become today

And we'll fight fire with fire

I had a break through

Inside, you can find your life in the night life

It's the rush you're feeling

You’re gonna try with all your might
To forget

To whisper in your ear
Then I’ll see you smile
As you dial all the numbers
Memorized, filed away
For this very day

This is inevitable, oh
Time may turn the leaves
But it’s inevitable that we
Will eventually see
Another spring again
On that you can depend

This is inevitable, oh
As long as we still breathe
This is inevitable, oh
The tide may move the sea
But it’s inevitable that we
Will eventually see
These waters rise again
On that you can depend

You can try to deny it baby
You can try, you can try
You can try to deny it baby
You can try your best

Hey, I'm calling you back.
Oooh, she's been a bitch tonight.
And by bitch I mean this rain; no cab, nowhere.
So I had to put on the wig, and the heels
And the lashes, and take the train, to the club
And you know the MTA should stand for:
Mother-fuckers Touching My Ass
So then I get to the club
Looking like a drowned, harassed rat
And I'm greeted, not by Miss Rose at the door
But our friend, Johnny Five-O
Yes honey, the NYPD shut down the party
No ? for me, I don't even know what's the tea
So I hope you're up girl
Because we are all coming over
Lock the doors, lower the blinds
Fire up the smoke machine and put on your heels
Cause I know exactly what we need

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker

We're spilling tea, and dishing just deserts when they deserve
And though the sun is rising, few may choose to leave

That the city was gone
You thought there would be advertisements
To give you something to go on

So we search the sky
For any flashing signs
We’ve gone too far beyond
The border it’s just you and I
And if this is the end
It’s the best place I’ve ever been
It feels so good to just
Get lost sometimes

Only the horses
Can find us tonight
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Our tracks they will follow
They’ll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses
Can bring us back home

We can’t escape the basic facts
How cold it can get
There’s nothing to protect ourselves
When the rain gets us wet

So I’ll just tell you now
This is our final bow

Hold me let me show you how
And if this is the end

Scissor Sisters,"Well she left me here halfway
Between the bright lights of Los Angeles
And the tawdry nights of San Jose
With Ecstacy and Ivory Wave
And a backpack full of Captain Jack
To take me to an early grave
And I’ve never been to paradise
Standing on this corner by myself
You don’t have to tell me twice

And the world’s not gonna end
If I could just pretend
That here’s a place to go

And the streets may look the same
Of any town by any name
Gonna find my afterglow
San Luis Obispo

The difference between delight
And loneliness could be a one way flight
In these San Luis Obispo nights

Where no one seems to mind
If you string your words together with
Kool cigarettes and sparkling wine
Keep the conversation light
Wait until the girls get under-dressed
And then the talk gets less polite
And I could stay here all my days
But will I spend my life deciding if
Happiness is just a phase

And I hope that I’m not wrong
Maybe here’s where I belong
Every winter free of snow
San Luis Obispo
But if she’s coming back again
I would flee but until then
Every day my love it grows
San Luis Obispo

The difference between delight
And loneliness is never black or white
In these San Luis Obispo nights

Sorry you misunderstood
This kid with his intentions good
When all I had was two feet left to stand
And if you’re coming back through town
Put your ear down to the ground
Cause this boy’s voice has changed into a man’s

And I hope that I’m not wrong
Baby here’s where I belong
Every winter free of snow
San Luis Obispo

I would flee but until then

The phone speaks another’s full name

It’s the secret life of letters
The secret life of words
Where do they hide unspoken
I haven’t heard

How many days in a sentence
I feel like passing this phrase
These aren’t my friends
Maybe they’ll be again
Arranging themselves in their ways

And if it expires, pray help from above""

With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more, wow

With a rebel yell, more, more, more, more, more, more

I'd dry your tears of pain, a million times for you
I'd sell my soul for you, babe, for money to burn for you

Things getting strange like up an down 
If you could read my mind it's hard to find
I said I want you back but this is no regret 

It's my point of view and I'm going through 
So take me away just for one day
I've never seen someone like you before
In my dreams I saw you standing there

I'm going out no more since I heard the news
There's someone you choose 
I can't believe what they said
That's why I feel so bad 

Morning, noon and night 
My thoughts run circles without any purpose
I can't stand no more - it's like circus
I want to repeat, there's nothing wrong I've done

She's the sun 

If I think of the past life is so fast
Those memories keep me alive and I will survive 
Even if I'm here and left without 
Is there any secret? do you think we'll keep it?

Life's so strange if you know what I mean
There's no one I've seen before like you
To be honest, I didn't expect something like this
It's you I miss now and forever

You and me together 
That's what we thought our life should be
I never could imagine this would happen to me
You feel better now you said it's what I cannot belive

And youÂ´ll be rock it tonight
So bring your body with you baby
And I make you feel right

ItÂ´s a pretty celebration of a
Natural kind
And a pleasure your experience
Will blow your mind

Everybody will be dancing to
The beat on the floor
You really come to situations never
Part of before

Satisfaction guaranteed if you 
Know what I mean
And if you walk in through that door
ItÂ´s such a freaky scene
Expecting More From Ratty

I canÂ´t change
I just want to do it
On the microphone just get into it
Come on tonight from left to right
Everybody now get ready for the night

Tough like steel and dangerous
We gonna rock the house, itÂ´s still like this
No time to chill so keep on moving
Get into the place, MC is groving

Expecting more from Ratty

As a matter of fact
In '92
I canÂ´t explain
ItÂ´s up to you

If you know what I mean itÂ´s the freaky scene
And things have changed a lot in between
So come on tonight and let them go
For those about who left the show

I recommend to join the case
The last call to rock the place

Coffee isn't my cup of tea",And No Matches
Scooter,"Jumping is an ability that most humans and many animals share to some degree.
It is the process of getting ones body off the ground for a short time using only ones own power
Usually by propelling oneself upwards by contraction and then forceful extension of the legs
In some cases the height of a jump may be increased by using a trampoline
Or by pushing down with the arms whilst playing leapfrog
One can jump up to reach something high
Or jump over a fence or ditch
Or jump down and one can jump whilst dancing
And as a sport
But jump also is the synonym for an exciting style of dancing just to freak out for sometime
Now listen to the sounds of Michael, Rick and the Chicks Terminator.
Please Jump

From somebody's police car

So you see, Your Honor, it was all in fun

Was just to see if the cops could run
Well, they run us in to see you in an alcoholic haze

I grabbed my chance and played my usual game
I tell you man, it can be a strain

Just shook her head and looked the other way
And then she said, I've met your type before
For me you're all the same, you're such a bore

Oh no, don't make no promises
Oh no, your body can't keep

She said, hey man, you're great and she took me home

Where the sun is shining, in the night.

Of cloudy-looking mountains
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops 
Roaming through Space ten thousand years ago
I've seen the giant city of Atlantis
Sinking to eternal waves of darkness 

Somewhere in the blue distance
Are those long-forgotten trees of yore
A broken violin floating alone in December
Darkness everywhere and nothing more.

Symbol, strange Symbol, Melancholy
Painting torrid colors to a sky of green
Candle breathing one night only

Understand that we are mush too young to die
Understand no one will survive

""How you want to make your life?""
I said, ""I can play guitar
And it will be alright   listen!""

When I came out of school
They said, ""Which way you want to go?""

Compared with rock 'n roll
To get the same thrill

Anyhow I've found a job
They tried to break me with their rules
But they had no chance at all
'Cause I knew what to do
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll

I had a feeling they couldn't buy
Still got that feeling they still can't buy,
They still can't buy,

Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin

So give her inches and feed her well

I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

 It was shattered by a gun
 Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried
 I saw a mother
 She was praying for her son
 Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die
 
 Do you ever ask yourself
 Is there a Heaven in the sky
 Why can't we get it right
 
 Cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why, why can't we live as one 
 
 I saw the evening 
 Fading shadows one by one
 We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice
 I saw the children
 The children of the sun
 How they wept, how they bled, how they died
 
 Do you ever ask yourself
 Is there a Heaven in the sky
 Why can't we stop the fight
 
 Cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why, why can't we live as one 
 
 Sometimes I think I'm going mad
 We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care
 But in my heart it doesn't change
 We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love
 
 And does it really matter  
 If there's a heaven up above
 We sure could use some love
 
 Cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why, why can't we live as one 
 Cause we all live under the same sky
 We all look up at the same stars
 Then why, tell me why can't we live as one",Under the Same Sun

In the sound of silence
Time is standing still
There's some kind of bond between us
That's givin' me the chill
Do you really wonder
That we can burn the sky
It's written a thousand years ago
In the book of life

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one who's always in my dreams
The one who keeps me goin'
When I can't go on
The one that I've been waiting for
For so long

Oh, yeah

Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one who's always in my dreams

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one who's mine eternally
The one who keeps me dreamin'

Who gives my life a meaning

Are you the one",Are You the One?

In the darkness of the room
I'm leaning back against the wall

And after all's been said and done
You're a woman, I'm a man
Could I turn back the time again

I won't let you down
Whatever comes along the way
Don't you agree that one thing is true
I'm not the best, but the best for you

I know you want it too
The magic of the moment
Is what I've got for you

The heartbeat of this night is made to lose control
And there is something in your eyes that's longing for some more
Let us find together the beat we're looking for

The rhythm of love keeps me dancing on the road
The rhythm of love, I've got the groove that hits the bone
The rhythm of love is the game I'm looking for
The rhythm of love is the heartbeat of my soul

Let's reach the top together
One night will never do
An exploding shot of pleasure
Is what I've got for you

Why don't you close your eyes, let your feeling grow?
I make you feel the taste of life until your love will flow

 What you give, you get back
 As long as I can think I've been
 Running to be free
 There's not a place that could have been too far
 Had nothing but a bag of dreams
 And this old guitar
 A couple of songs to play for you an me
 There's so much love inside of me
 That wants to be released
 I can't help it so I give it all away
 What you give you get it back
 So take my love just because it's all I have
 Take my heart take my soul
 I just never want it back
 As long as I've been living
 I've had music in my veins
 I can't go on without it anymore
 My suitcase is a wanderer
 That takes me I believe
 For a walk right across your heart
 There's so much love inside of you
 That wants to be released
 And all you gotta do is let it go
 What you give you get back
 So take my love just because it's all I have
 Take my heart take my soul

All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

Last night was shaking
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong
With another sin

She needs to tell
So give her inches
And feed her well
More days to come
New places to go
I've got to leave
It's time for a show
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
My body is burning
It starts to shout
Desire is coming
It breaks out loud
Lust is in cages
Till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it
With someone I choose
The night is calling
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
He's licking his lips
He's ready to win
On the hunt tonight
For love at first sting

She's dressed oh so cute
She looks a little crazy
In her Hollywood shoes
Well baby loves driving
In my hot brand new car
She thinks less than flying
Is not fast enough
But when you turn upside down
Life ain't too much fun
I wanted to cry
But the tears wouldn't come
Here comes my baby
She's the one I adore
Well she's a lucky lady
Born in a Gucci store
With gold cards in motion
And the platinum too
She jets across the ocean
A little faster than you
But when it rains in St. Barth
Life ain't too much fun
I wanted to cry
But the tears wouldn't come
I wanted to cry
But the tears wouldn't come
Every night without you
I miss to have you by my side
Ohh, so I keep waiting, I keep waiting
I swear I never let you go again
Well here comes my baby
With a Brad Pitt lookalike
Right through immigration
And straight out of my life
Well it seems the friendly skies
Are pretty good fun

When the moon is on the rise
And the dreams are close
To the ones that we love

For heaven to give a sign
So we could find the place
Where angels come from

To save one hopeless heart

The voice of your heart
In a world full of pain

Maybe I, maybe you
Are just dreaming sometimes
But the world would be cold
Without dreamers like you

Scorpions,"In every corner of my memory
There's no place you wouldn't be
If anything, I wish I had
Another dream with you
Life was forever yesterday
Nothing in the world could take
Your love away, will I ever know
That time will ease the pain
For me someday

She said I won't leave you, ever
Just love me forever
She said you can leave, but never
Walk away

Lights reflecting in the evening sun
Back to the place where we were one
Soul mates forever about to chase
Rainbows in the dark
Another day to destiny
Come on and set me free
When I close my eyes, I see your smile
As I walk in the pouring rain
I call your name

She said I won't leave you, ever
Just love me forever
She said, we will be together, someday
She said I won't leave you, ever
Just love me forever
She said, you can leave, but never
Walk away

I can see a million faces
When I take a walk outside
But I just never knew
That I could go a million places
And I'd see always, only you

The loneliness crawls up on me
Without you there's no me
At any time or any place
But time will ease the pain
For me someday

She said I won't leave you, ever
Just love me forever
She said, we will be together, someday
She said, I will wait forever
I won't leave you ever
She said, you can leave, but never
Ever walk away

Don't walk away
Oh no don't walk away
I'll be waiting, always
Until you'll wake up from this dream

Ice flows through my veins
As my life drains
Northern bound, my dogs are dying

That nothing is impossible

Said I'd do it someday
Someday is now
When I see the world around me receding
No time for bleeding
Show the world how
Someday is now

Eight steps till I reach the summit
My line breaks and I fall down
The rocky terrain
My bones are broken into pieces
My mind can't wait
To get up and do it again

I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer
I'm pushed to the limit
Said I'd do it someday
Someday is now
When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying
There's no time for crying
I'm gonna win someday

No turning back, no more yesterdays
I just won't get lost in the haze
All my tomorrows, no sadness, no sorrow
Watch out for the rest of my days

Freezing in the cold

I keep running from my shadow
I'm not the only one
Somewhere in the distance
Someone's taking flight

But after all
The time has come, to leave it all

I've been trying all my life
To stand up every time I fall
If you could see it through my eyes

The future on my hands
I'm standing here alone
With open arms again
Tomorrow ain't no stranger
There'll be a lucky star
And love will find it's way
Into someones heart

Too late for tears
No time to be confused
It's just the echo of our
Swan song

Cause your love has found it's way
Into my heart, oh yeah

You make me dream
By the look in your eyes
You give me the feel, I've been longing for
I've been longing for so long

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
You set my heart on fire
All the way
When you came into my life
The world was not the same, oh no
Cause your love has found it's way
Into my heart

Just forever in love

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
It was love at first sight
All the way

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
You set my heart on fire
I never felt that way

Scorpions,"Good times bad times
Bad times good times

We were twisting Chubby Checker style
In a roaring sixties summer night
We walked the moon and we were free
When Jimi played guitar
We shared a dream with Martin Luther King
We saw J.F.K. in West Berlin
When he spoke those famous words that day
Our world was not the same

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
Let the film just roll

We were lost in shock, the world was doomed
Nikita hit us with a shoe
We watched the world go upside down
When the Kennedys got shot
We were screaming when the world was fab
We had Rock 'n' Roll invade our hearts
We had Elvis, Janis, Marilyn
And hair, to let it grow

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
Let the film just roll
Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
We're still standing after all

Back in the cold war
Our hearts were warm
Just because sex was free
In the summer of love

Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
Let the film just roll
Remember the good times
Remember the bad times
Remembering my life, your life
We're still standing after all

Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
 
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
 
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
 
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
 
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
 
The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say
 
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away

I can see the sadness in your eyes
In these desperate times
We get pushed and shoved from every side

I can't love you if you won't let me
Can't touch me if you don't try
I can feel you
I know that you're ready to take it to the other side

Love will keep us alive
Let's make the moment right
It's now or never
Love will keep us alive
Even the darkest night
Will shine forever
Love will keep us alive
Love will keep us alive
Love, love will keep us alive

When you walk away
There's an empty feeling in my mind
As the days go by
We get caught up in our separate lives

If you need me
You know I'll come running
Right to you
Just give me a sign
I won't leave you
We'll make it together
And take it to the end of time

Love will keep us alive
Let's make the moment right
It's now or never

You know I'd never want to control you
I only want to be by your side

I finally found the strength to face
The pain you made me feel
I always held my tongue
And all the things you've done to me
Are secrets to reveal

I'll never let you do this to someone else
No I could never live with myself

How dare you use my shame
To play your wicked games
With the mask you're wearing
And now you gotta make amends
For the demons in my head
I'll nail you to the cross
The cross I'm bearing

You, you said you'd save my soul
And sacrificed the innocence
That I will never know
Now it's time that you confess
They say the devil doesn't rest
Until the truth is told

No I could never live with myself

The cross I'm bearing

I believed in love
I believed in trust
I believed in you
You became my God
I believed in love
I believed in trust

I was young and so naive
You were God and I believed
You made me kneel
You made me feel
Like it was all my fault
But now I know it wasn't mine at all

To play your wicked game
You gotta make amends
For the demons in my head

Leaps highest to the sun

Pay attention my child down

Writing my last song for you
Hear the words carefully

That I can't stay another day

I'm starting over like before
I'll change this stupid ending
And stay with you forever more
But when I'm lying next to you
It's hard to bargain with the truth
Cause when you know the love is gone
The time has come to write your last song

There you are
Smiling at me from the next room
Beautiful as the first day I met you
And I'm so sorry
I couldn't be the one to love you
The way that you deserve to be

I'm starting over like before
I'll change this stupid ending
And stay with you forever more
But when I'm lying next to you
It's hard to bargain with the truth
Cause when you know the love is gone
The time has come to write your last song

It's hard to think of you and I
As total strangers
I've lived this last goodbye
A million times or more in my mind
My mind, my mind

Oh and I'm gonna miss you
But I can't go back
Even just to kiss you

For our downfall
And we deserve it playing God
With our machines
Our religions are a prison
That's our fatal flaw
Bombs are flying
While we're sleeping with the enemy

When I'm telling you to stay down

Riding lady luck
Driving in the fast lane and just stepped on the gas

My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
Yeah I was raised on rock
My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
And I was raised on rock

Shoot me up baby make me high
And hit the jackpot in the heat of the night
Wanna kiss your lips
Wanna move your hips
See my desire in your laser-beam eyes

You shake me up got me spinning Ã¢??round
You know what's going up must come down
Tomorrow I'll be gone
A million miles from home
The only road I know leads out of town

Cause I was raised on rock
My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time

Run away I've got to

When your life turns upside-down, it breaks your heart
When you get crushed in a house of cards

Just wait till I get myself straight.
I'm gonna put Romeo's fame right smack dab outta date.
 
Finding a job tomorrow morning,
Got a little something I want to do.
Gonna buy something I can ride in
Take my girl dating at the drive-in,
Our love's gonna be written down in history
Just like Romeo and Juliet

Scott Ainslie,"I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

[Chorus:]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

[Chorus]

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love
Scott Alan,"Dry away the tears
Lay aside your fears
No more pain, for my love
I am here, now go to sleep

And when the angels come
I know that they will treat you well
That they will pull you through 
And lift you up from all that's held you down

There's a heaven up there
And it waits just for you
So close your eyes and dream
And there will be a world you once knew

A world without the pain
That has stuck with you for far too long
A world that does contain a love like mine
To watch you grow strong

And when my time arrives
Please wait and make a place for me
For when I do arrive
Your face should be the first face I see

So dry away the tears
Lay aside your fears
No more pain, for my life
It is time
Now go to sleep",Goodnight
Scott B. Adams,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?

I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song
Scott Gordon,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Scott Gordon,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Scott Gordon,"This couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I""m holding you now and yet never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never, again
 
Again, this couldn't happen again

Scott Gordon,"I don't ever care to rise to power
I would rather be with you an hour
For the things that one can buy
Are not worth a lover's sigh

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart",I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire
Scott Gordon,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Scott Gordon,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Scott Gordon,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Scott H. Biram,"Well, let me tell you 'bout this s*** a** town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time

If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny

And there's so much that I just cannot guesture why,

Scott Hamilton,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Scott Hamilton,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

Scott Hamilton,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

[Chorus]",Somtimes I'm Happy
Scott Hamilton,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Scott Hamilton,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone
Scott Hamilton,"This isn't sometimes, this is always.
This isn't maybe, this is always.
This is love,
The real beginning of forever,
This isn't just mid summer madness,
A passing glow, a moment's gladness,
Yes it's love.
I knew it on the night we met,
You tied a string around my heart,
So how can I forget you.
With every kiss I know that
This is always.",This Is Always
Scott Hamilton,"Why did I wander
Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?
Isn't it a pity!
Isn't it a crime!
My journey is ended,
Everything is splendid;
Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea 
Here I stay!

It's a funny thing;
I look at you,
I get a thrill I never knew,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Here we are at last,
It's like a dream,
The two of us, a perfect team,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
Fishing for salmon,
Losing at backgammon!
What joys untasted,
My nights were sour,
Spent with Schopenhauer!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!",Isn't It a Pity
Scott Hamilton,"A Portrait of Jennie
More precious to me
Than a masterpiece how ever famous it be

The portrait of Jennie
Is etched on my heart
Where her features have been sketched from the start

Ah, the color and beatuy of life 
And the glow of her sprit divine
All cast in heaven's own design

With a portrait of Jennie
I never will part
For there isn't any portrait of Jennie
Except in my heart

For there isn't any portrait of Jennie
Except in my heart",A Portrait of Jenny
Scott Hamilton,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue
Scott Hamilton,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head

Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

And all my bright tomorrows belong to you",All My Tomorrows

Time to unwind

Got my mind made up
All night i'ma stay up and fuck a lot
But nah, I ain't a playa
Girl I'll house you
You in my hut 
Thinkin of a rhyme trying to hold my nut
Armand on the cut Com Sense MC
Baby put that ass in the air where I can see
Feel free feel good
You ain't in the club trying to find a real love
I spill dubs on Heiny's and tequila shots
Where studs and chicks pee in the same spot
It's hot as hell
Freakshow on the dance floor Is that you I smell?
I'ma give that ass room
Better yet, let's fuck in the bathroom
If we have room it's a full moon.

But I got style to mine
So I dog 'em like Phife or Snoop.
Already boned 3 out the group with my crew I rock steady like the park
I hear foot steps in the dark
From them househeads
Dancin in the circle in the house like curfew
To work you to the bone
Old school cuts get me in a zone
In the line I get restless
I'm straight I'm on the guestlist
The red light specialist
Love is the message
From B-Boy to raver expressions
I get open like the bar at the rap sessions
Diggin in the crate with Armand

Scott Helman,"There's a place I go where there's no heat
But it never gets cold, and that I know for sure
There's a rusted gate and a chandelier,
A flowered door and a mattress on the floor
She lays me down so low here under the stars
And knowing it won't last just tears me apart

This is how it goes
This is how it goes
Baby, we're rolling
Just a boat on the ocean
Up in the sky
Heaven so close

Taking off your clothes
Taking off my clothes
Give me a moment
I don't care if it's stolen
Way up high
In your sweet little bungalow

She's got a temper, yeah like a redhead
A tabby cat and a tattoo she regrets
She's a carpenter with a book of poems
Got another side that no one really knows
Watching through the window you smile in the dark
Knowing we can't stay here, but you left a mark

This is how it goes
This is how it goes
Baby, we're rolling
Just a boat on the ocean
Up in the sky

Taking off your clothes
Taking off my clothes
Give me a moment
I don't care if it's stolen
Way up high
In your sweet little bungalow

This is enough, don't be insecure
As long as you kiss me when I walk through your window
To your door and I'll know
When the night is filled with cold
We'll be warm, and nothing matters
When the world is moving slow
I got you in my arms
Now it's fine, don't feel low

This is how it goes
This is how it goes

Lost my job at McDonald's
Kept droppin' burgers on the floor
Everybody knows I ain't nothin' but a fool
So mama won't ya send me to gittar school
Got the money, so I'm in the door

Bought me a shiny 'lectric gittar
Baddest gittar in the store
Came with a wire an' a funny little pin
And the school is gonna teach me to plug it in
Got the money with the highest score

Takin' the bus to Hollywood
Gonna be so fine
Big swimmin' pools and movie stars
Gonna have a real good time
A real good time

Got no more time fo' lessons
Learned some chords an' got a tan
Now I'm gone up to Seattle way
Gonna play my chords in a big grunge band

Sweetheart, you know it's been awhile -
Something that's been on my mind that I really needed to express to you....
I must tell you how I really feel....

Oh you are an angel
An angel sent from hell
Your mouth like a sailor
Your cheap cosmetic smell

Darling you are a loser
It's you I love to kill

Darling you ruined my life
So I hate you and I always will

From your implants that failed
To the milkman that you nailed
It's been you, it's been you
That's tried to make me lose my mind

Well, you come on so tough
And then you can't get it up
And if you do
Then it's still hard to find

You cheap little ho'
Slippin' out the back door
You go out with any man
For a nickel or a dime

You no workin bum
You never made me come
Yeah, I faked it

Oh darlin' I'll stop my drinking
If you'll only shave your legs

Should I fall on my knees and pray

Gimme eight or nine

Say L, hold these keys man
What kind of wheels is those brah
(man them boys got 20's dog, Lorenzos)
Man, I ain't never seen shining like that
Say H.A.W.K, what why'all use to do fool
When you was growing up

[H.A.W.K]
I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K
Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O
Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro
Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego
Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow

[Lil Flip]
I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels
Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles
Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles
Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do
Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

[AP]
I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar
I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par
From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani
AP became a business man, that's all about his money

[Mista Madd]
Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again
I use to wear a swatch watch, now I only wear Movado
Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

[Redd]
Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though
Seein niggas Redd capping on, the comedy bout my chaperone
My dress code is casual, but all of a sudden I'm valuable

Scott Krippayne,"All who sail the sea of faith
Find out before too long
How quickly blue skies can grow dark
And gentle winds grow strong

Suddenly fear is like white water
Pounding on the soul
Still we sail on knowing
That our Lord is in control

Sometimes He calms the storm
With a whispered peace be still
He can settle any sea
But it doesn't mean He will

Sometimes He holds us close
And lets the wind and waves go wild
Sometimes He calms the storm
And other times He calms His child

He has a reason for each trial
That we pass through in life
And though we're shaken
We cannot be pulled apart from Christ

No matter how the driving rain beats down
On those who hold to faith
A heart of trust will always
Be a quiet peaceful place",Sometimes He Calms the Storm

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?

I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

We all cry in the dark
Get cut off before we start

and as your first act begins
You realise they're all waiting
For a fall, for a flaw, for the end

Could you talk to quiet my fears
Could you pull me aside
Just to acknowledge that I've tried

Send a doctor to my house
Got me a fever coming 'round the bend
And a bus load of danger

Straight talking, you're sending me to bed
'Cause I ain't walking in my state
A temperature that will not go away
So let it willow in my head, my head

Prescribed pills, just soil 'em down the sink
'Cause in the hills is my cure

No [Incomprehensible] faces burn me

Your output love resign it to my ears
The blinking signals from your mouth
Some cleansing water to wash away the grind
The city laughter on my face, my face

It's not for me, a speed in which you walk

And just in and choking from the fall

Scott Matthews,"I wander hopelessly, trying to think about me
But I'm trying to forget the things that dwell on me
Sitting on a horse to the wind and sit in my comfortable tree
Mesmerized by the beautiful sky, sit thinking where I wanna be

I'm gonna sleep with the peaceful moon again
Until the sun bleeds through my eyes
I'm gonna wait until the morning comes
To wipe the sleep out from eyes, yeah

And not a soul to be heard a sound so sweet
The pin hit the ground, I feel the [Incomprehensible] my feet
Catch a falling leaf from its journey to the ground
I think I found my saving grace, dead silence all around

I'm gonna sleep with the peaceful moon again
Until the sun bleeds through my eyes
I'm gonna wait until the morning comes
To wipe the sleep out from eyes

I sit and dream, I lie and wait
I see how long it takes to the level might fade
I grab all the that you can hold and just follow the tree home

Scott Matthews,"This velvet-lined silver box
Rests with me around the clock
Through colored glass, a piercing dawn
Through broken glass I watch the night fall

Conflict looms in a blood-red sky
A child cries seeking mother's eyes
Just a fleeting sound of silence plays
The day must end praying on your knees

Tired of waiting for the earth to calm
We huddle together and pray for no harm
The flickering light signals the alarm

Oh, please don't let it be me
Oh, please don't let it be me

Trying hard to stay awake
I'm running fast, trying to make the last gate
But lo and behold here I stand
Out of time with my head in my hands

The sweat runs down my desperate face
I'm stumbling on my old rotten legs
The heavy winds build strong their walls
Push me back, no joy at all, at all

Tired of waiting for the earth to calm
We huddle together and pray for no harm
The flickering light signals the alarm

Oh, please don't let it be me
Oh, please don't let it be me

Scott Matthews,"She's a gambler spinning wheels
A poison victim but look of steel
The coldest hearts you've ever felt
The coldest hands you've ever held

Taking down on your way
A million miles, still no headway
As I learn to live long
In a mind I'm proud to roam

She's elusive and I'm awake
You're finally real, there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
She said my destiny lies in the hands that set me free

Reckless night, she hears me breathe
Cursing the sky at this company
They lost the wisdom deep inside
When bitterness shows its side

If it's true, I am doomed
What more is there to hold on to?
A strand of her hair is all I own
A gift to me, this sorry soul

She's elusive and I'm awake
You're finally real, there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
She said my destiny lies in the hands that set me free

The sun in sails and this ain't right
There's more to her than meets the eye
She comes and goes at any time
Back in my head at another time

Scott Matthews,"Oh Lord, a distant beam of light
The jab of neon floods my weary eyes
It illuminates my soul reasons why
I'm heading your way with the traffic on my side

Remember how it was before
Just a minute away, I'll be knocking on your front door
Don't underestimate this precious time
Every second is treated as though there is no time

Your eyes are wider than before
So little has changed
But your eyes now see much more

Hush, now sway and fall asleep
Gonna drive you away from the trampling of bustling feet
You can lose your troubled thoughts for tonight at least
You can wake in the morning, feeling that you can breathe

Little darling, you're mine for tonight
Your mellow and tender soul is hard to find
From you I draw no doubts deep inside
I surrender myself to your presence and peace of mind

Your eyes are wider than before
So little has changed but your eyes now see much more
So much more, so, so much more
So much more, so much more
",Eyes Wider Than Before
Scott Matthews,"Oh, friend child
What hell with the innocent smile
In a drained state
Filled his breath blow right out the gate

Losing disbelief
Seen his laugh from the way down the street
Finds it hard to breath
When you're a shot from the dead-end sleeve

Yeah, I only wince at your hell
I was paid to except what was dead
Like a fool I've been fooling myself
Fool like no one else

I'll be the Mars
Losing all control for sure
I'm in debt with pain
I can't bleed no more

If the morning sun
Fills your eyes and it's sun in your laws?
See the clouds face
Raise a smile to the cries that he hates

Only time will tell
If the rose isn't red anymore
And expresses are blank
Then you know who to thank
Who to thank, who to thank

I only wince at your hell
I was paid to except what was dead
Like a fool I've been fooling myself
Fool like no one else

I'll be the Mars?
Losing all control for sure

",The Fool's Fooling Himself
Scott Matthews,"See the sign up ahead, it calls out your name
It's a meaningful sign but it makes no sense
They saw you pass on through with only one shoe
And a mystified mind with an angel for a guide

There's a destiny song that's meant for me
But I'm weary of the soles of my innocent feet
Like a single site you know it's all you've got
So be sure to aim true with your eyes on full view

There's nobody you can accuse
The mirror reflects upon truth and from inside I feel bruised
The mask that I wear is unsure
Unable to find a known cure so I hide forevermore

I was passing stranger with a name I can't remember
I am going blind from the dust in my eyes
But the ground back home seems so far away
And I'm coughing up my lungs, but I know I've gotta stay

I'm moving slow with nowhere to go
I stumble on a sign 'One Mile To Dine'
It takes a little time and I'm barely alive
But I make it nonetheless with a shortage of breath

The coffee you poured me is cold
The paper I'm reading is old
And that smile is not your own

The clothes that I wear are soaked through
I'm all out of luck for you
And there's a million things I can't do
Can't do, I can't do

Something strangely familiar about the way I am
I'm sitting next to the man with the unsteady hands
He says, ""How are you, son, where you been all week?""
I recognize his voice even in my sleep

Lord only knows what I got up to
Maybe it's best for me if I just found my shoes
And confirm my suspicions for heaven's sake
And pick up my trail from my front gate

There's nobody you can accuse
The mirror portrays a bold truth
And from inside it's what you do

Start digging around and you'll find
Missing for years your own life
You're better off trying not to hide
Not to hide, trying not to hide
",Passing Stranger
Scott Matthews,"What you want is what I need
I'm holding on for the things I believe

I lay on my bed and locked my flat
So I looked to the sky to search your stare
I've been searching
For you in my prayers

What you need is what I want
The same as me, I keep holding on
What you want is what I need
I'm holding on for things I believe

I lay on my bed and locked my flat
So I looked to the sky to search your stare
I've been searching
For you in my prayers

Smoke just flame
Like a transparent gaze
Thought the mist as I a trace
Of such a beautiful face

I'll clear the way for your, your view
I'll make no excuse
Pockets full of abuse
I've been searching for you

I lay on my bed and locked my flat
So I looked to the sky to search your stare
I've been searching
For you in my prayers

Cloudless space, it's a mission I make
I breath free from the haze, and suddenly I'm awake
Into a mind I read, I hear the silence speak
A voice flows like leaves

And settles to my feet
That sadness can be of just you and me

I awake in my sleep and it's you I hold

Oh, oh, I gaze at the way that the colors
Merge into a beautiful view
But nothing compares to the path that I tread on now
And I'm led into

The rise to my senses
I follow the sweet scented figure I tasted now
Taste I can only describe as a dream I once had
It tastes so good

Surmise my soul to the depths of your waves
Under lock and key is the feeling I crave, oh
Sooner, oh, we ache with the touch of your skin
Oh, you're living proof that there's healing within

Oh, oh, I gaze at the way that the colors
Merge into a beautiful view
But nothing compares to the path that I tread on now

Scott Matthews,"Breathe a sigh of relief
We're not all hiding under the sheets
Mother's son, beautifully dressed
But walks the streets only in his vest

I'm here again, nothing's changed
I'm flying through on my drifting plain
And I graced the earth with my views
You don't wanna hear, well, that's up to you

Say what you want about me
'Cause I don't believe what I read
So I don't mind, you see you
Have no clue of where I'm going to

White feathered medicine
Is what I crave and all's forgiven
And their fragile wings and delicate cries
Comfort me and my bleeding eyes

See beyond a weary face
You're all the same and there's a pretty little face
It says nothing to me about who I am
I've got nothing to burn, only your sorry hands

Time to put a stop to it, I had to put up with it
Now I'm sick and tired of it so
Take your views to some other avenue

I don't care, you do as you please
Your crying face and begging on your knees
I know what to do, so leave me be
I've got this feeling, it could be the death of me

I circle around the view I'm in
I wait for days, my patience wearing thin
And I wait for you, tirelessly
Nothing gained, I just fall to sleep

So you're writing a letter now, I'm taking a look
While you're signing with kisses and talk of how much
You want to help me write, I ride into the sky

And in the morning I can see them walking
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
And I cant keep myself from talking.

To say good morning and really mean it
To feel these changes happening in me
But not to notice till I feel it.

May your heart be so pure its one that God wants to know.",For Jack Tymon
Scott Miller,"I've got a plan to be such a man
That you will see that I was worth having.
And by living well it'll put her through hell
Knowing that once you had totally had me.
And right from the start
It's falling apart.

Because now you're with him
Like we might have been-
A house and a garden in east Massachusetts.
The cod and the bean, bitter and mean
What else can you grow where the soil is useless?
And right from the start
You're falling apart.

And so here we are at the end of the bar
Talking of old friends and casually drinking.
Every move that I move you see right through
And it feels so good when you know what I'm thinking.
And right from the start
We're falling apart.
But right up to the end
I want yens to hold me, …….

Scott Miller,"It didn't take too long before I ran out of things to say
You know my baby and me we were going out on our first date
And I hope she's not the kind that likes to make a man wait.

It didn't take too long before I ran out of whiskey and gin
We're getting closer to her house and its right around the very next bend
I gotta loosen her up or she ain't never gonna let me in.

It didn't take too long
It didn't take too long
It didn't take too long before I knew how long it would take.

Because she's panting and she's screaming
And the windows they are steaming
And the things I hear her saying man,
I think she's really meaning
It didn't take too long before I knew how long it would take.

It didn't take too long until I realized what I fell in
When she threw me on the floor and she loved me like a champion
Hey that little girl won herself a golden band….

It didn't take too long….

",It Didn't Take Too Long
Scott Miller,"I don't care if the weight is heavy
Or the rocks are in the road
You're feet are flat or your engine's burned
You've got to pull your load

Pull your load
If you don't, then don't come back
Pull your load
Your rope is showing slack
You ain't doing what you're told

Don't tell me that you're trying
It gets you nothing you can hold
Try me if I'm lying, son
You're gonna pull your load

Scott Miller,"I born in a town that the industry built in the tired dirt of the Tidewater
To a hard-headed man who had the good luck to marry a decent man's daughter
And from my earliest days I could tell things were bad
President's - they were resigning
And I was raised by the graves

I wore my brother's clothes because our house - it was cold
With a cry of ""pennies make dollars""
And we settled down so far from that town
That God only knows if you holler
And on the back of the farm there was an old graveyard
Where I used to play as a child
And I was raised by the graves

Well, I struck out at home, and I went on my own into a world that has already passed me
And I married a woman a lot like my mom, and I act a lot like my daddy
But when it's time to go home, I'll head back to the farm
Where the names will all be familiar
Because I was raised by the graves",Raised by the Graves
Scott Miller,"I jumped straight at it when I had the chance
I joined the army and I went to France
At Roosevelt's request
Two weeks of sitting in the mud 
Made me lie to the man that I could drive a truck
For the Red Ball Express

[Chorus:]
All we do is keep it rolling on
Trading bodies for petroleum
Heating rations on the manifold
And never sleep enough to dream about home

Benzedrined and looking through cat eyes
Of a deuce and-a-half and a day's supply
Of jerry cans in back
Ain't no secret how the generals felt
""Fuck the men, they can eat their belts
But the tanks - they must have gas.""

[Chorus]

The gears are sticking, and the pressure's low
I felt the bump that means it's time to go
Another twenty miles
Thirty-six hours and I still ain't slept
I'm hearing voices talk inside my head
In Burma Shaving rhyme

All we do is keep it rolling on
Trading bodies for petroleum
Heating rations on the manifold
Even now I've never felt that old

Because fifty years later and you don't forget
Being eighteen and scared to death
In a world that's changing fast
Now my own son sends his own son off
To fight the next fight to be fought
And the Red Ball brings me back",Red Ball Express
Scott Miller,"I don't want to fight
Sometimes I'm always right
I'd love to change it but you know I can't, so
I need a second chance

I know I'll do you wrong
That's why I wrote this song
I hate to ask you so far in advance but
I need a second chance

I came into this world alone
And I've always felt on my own
I came into this world alone
And I've always felt on my own

My reputation is
Not how I want to live
And how I'm living isn't worth a damn, so
I need a second chance

I guess she's happy now
I, myself, have found some true romance so
I got a second chance

And I finally found a home",Second Chance
Scott Miller,"Midnight, and I'm feeling all right but my baby is tired
We drove down to a party in town
And I should have known I was gonna drink too hard
The windy road when I'm driving it home
Every twist and turn
I've had enough of the way I was
Seems like by now it's time to learn
The way

The back porch where we first kissed is where we said so long
I headed out to find what it is that makes a man want to come back home
The windy road when I'm driving it home
Every twist and turn
I've had enough of the way I was
Seems like by now it's time to learn
The way

The West is right and the East is left when you're headed South
The sun will rise, and the sun will set another day, another chance to figure out

Seems like by now it's time to learn
The way",The Way
Scott Miller,"We've met like we'd had a past
A common feeling that I never had before
How are you doing down home Johnson City?

Back then I thought I owned my youth
And I had found the truth
The wild things grow

First breath, bear to take it in
The softest touch of skin, the holy world unfolds
Till death, I promise all I have, this new discovered path
Where the wild things grow, we'll stay

Well sin, original or not
And not if you get caught, can scar your very soul
The gift that the pain and pleasure, bring make you silently sing
When the wild things grow

A voice, I've never heard before
The begging for some more, some kind of problem grown
The noise of the dying being choked, the makers name invoked
When the wild things grow, one more

We've met like we'd had a past
A common feeling that I never had before

Scott Nygaard,"half the people they want all kinds of things
some want money and some want diamond rings
I feel in love in with millionaire's daughter
and the people in hell all want icewater

well I asked for her hand and she said go see my pa
I found him in the garden and said ""I'll be your son-in-law""
and I showed him the thirty dollar ring that I bought her
he said, ""people in hell all want icewater""

back under her window I pulled out my robe
come on down baby and we'll elope
she climbed-a halfway but her wrists got caught up
and then the sky was black and it rained icewater

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing

To walk the line down a crooked lane
Fell off the road to heaven,

Sleeping in each others arms
Walking in each others dreams
Was it only yesterday

Where's the girl that I once knew
Running home through winter parks
Arm in Arm and heart in heart
Now like children in the dark
We hold hands and watch the rain

When you kissed my eyes awake
Running mornings crowded streets
Just to find we've missed our bus
But we'd laugh , kiss, what the hell

When you'd burst in from the rain
Clasp my head between your hands,
Kiss away the darkest day
Always there to understand.
You could make me proud again

Now I go aimlessly at night
Sleep with faces I don't know

And the shadows of this room

I must search you eyes again

Scott Walker,"In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam

There's a sailor who sleeps
While the riverbank weeps
With the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam

There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken down fight
And in the port of Amsterdam

There's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats

Only fishheads and tails
He will show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can swallow the moon
That can haul up the sails

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
Bring me more fish
Put it down by my side

Then he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he gets up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to paunch

They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaks 
Splitting the night with the
Roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of
The accordion bursts

Then out to the night
With their pride in their pants
With the slut that they tow 
Underneath the street lamps

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He drinks to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love
To a thousand other men
They've bargained their bodies
And their virtue long gone
For a few dirty coins
And when he can't go on
He plants his nose in the sky
And he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry
For an unfaithful love

Someone should have shouted you had gone in her ear
That summer was stolen away

Badly pressed and worn

Reach out grab the memories that are left for your hand

Such a small love
Such a little tear
Is this all that's left
On your cheek so pale

His shallow half lit eyes
His rotted teeth grown on
A drunken madman nights
Ending up in hjail

With night fallings
Drenched in day-glo red
Words collided
Things we left unsaid

Perfumed pillows
Girls that clung so near

I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night

Can't help but wonder
If you're lonely too
As I lie here and toss about
So alone, so without you
How I wish, my heart with me

My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live
The Joys we have known
I pray that someday

Our love will see the light' til then
In thick dark silence I beg my heart to replace
All through and oh so long and sleepless night

And give some sky
I've got me some wings
I'm eager to try

But wait till I've flown

You people up there
On top of the world
I'll meet you, I swear
I'm staking my claim
Remember my name

You're gonna hear from me

On the road before me
I'm Fortune's child

That wants to be played

Scott Walker,"Hello Mr. Big Shot
Say, you're looking smart
I've had a tiring day
I took the kids along to the park

You've become a stranger
Every night with the boys
Got a new suit
That old smile's come back
And I kiss the children good night
And I slip away on the newly waxed floor

I've become a giant
I fill every street
I dwarf the rooftops
I hunchback the moon

Stars dance at my feet
Leave it all behind me
Screaming kids on my knee
And the telly swallowing me
And the neighbor shouting next door
And the subway trembling the roller-skate floor

I seek the buildings blazing with moonlight
In Channing Way
Their very eyes seem to suck you in with their laughter
They seem to say

You're all right now
So stop a while behind our smile
In Channing Way

Oh to die of kisses
Ecstasies and charms
Pavements of poets will write that I died
In nine angel's arms

And they all were smiling
Still seductive as sin in their eyes
The man I had been
No more hard luck stories to wear
Nothing left to give
Why the hell should I care

Ann knows my smile and buries my shadow
In Channing Way
And with her cellophane sighs
Corrina the candle
Begs me to stay

You're all right now
So stop a while behind our smile

Scott Walker,"I've watched her from the river banks
I knew her when she danced with dreams
White doves were there to dress her hair
And so was Madelaine

At night the people's faces danced
Like pearls colliding on the breast
Of fat Marie whose thunder laugh
Was just a thread from crying

Her sailors stained her cobblestones
With wine and piss and death desire
And sometimes blood for Madelaine
Whose laughter was the night

Her girls would lift their dresses high
And breathe the stars and kiss the sky
She'd smother them with whispers then
Embrace them with her sighs

Before the bottle dulled my eyes
And made me so I couldn't stand
I'd overact and play the clown
When Madelaine would cry

And now I watch from riverbanks
I watch it weave it's memories
White doves turned gray and flew away
And so did Madelaine",The Bridge

Are as cold as the sphinx
Always dreaming of minks
They drive you to drink

Are as soft as a sigh

The tiny waltz of a merry go round
Cascading lights for every heartbeat

I ride upon this giant storm
Through rust-red rooms where shadows breathe from every
board

The world is up for auction sales
A thousand lies descend
The women's tear-tracked cheeks
Still we'll dance them on and on
We can't stop now
Not now until we reach the dawn

Give us your thighs

In a mobile army whorehouse
Gift from the army, free of cost

A little touch of tenderness 
Maybe a word, a smile
An hour of happiness
But, next, next

Oh, it wasn't so tragic
The high heavens did not fall
But how much of that time
I hated being there at all
Next, next Now I always will recall
The brothel truck, the flying flags
The queer lieutenant who slapped
Our asses as if we were fags
Next, next

I swear on the wet head
Of my first case of gonorrhea
It is his ugly voice 
That I forever hear
Next, next

That voice that stinks of whiskey
Of corpses and of mud
It is the voice of nations
It is the thick voice of blood
Next, next

And since the each woman
I have taken to bed
Seems to laugh in my arms
To whisper through my head
Next, next

All the naked and the dead
Should hold each others hands
As they watch me scream at night
In a dream no one understands
Next, next

And when I am not screaming
In a voice grown dry and hollow
I stand on endless naked lines
Of the following and the followed

A string tied to his underwear
Through cobbled stone streets a child races
And shouts ""Billy, come down from there""

""My mother's calling"" his voice whimpers

A child murmurs a weary sigh
My mother weeps, and weaves her hair
With worries please, Come down from there

Through fields of clay and granite grey
They play without a sound

To buzzing eyes you cry for help

And they took the detours that scattered the way
They departed from summer like two ragged soldiers
Dragging their heels through their fantasies

There were meals in the missions for two frozen statues
And long drafty sermons devouring their knees
Sometimes passions in winter turn to cold soundless moments
That teared in the eyes of their fantasies

There were nights on park benches, stale bread for the pigeons
Good mornings to faces who just turned away
And on one road confusion, the other desire
So they took to the road of their fantasies

One would speak of a lake where he used to go swimming
The other had no memories left for his mind

My name would be Antonio
And all my bridges I would burn
And when I gave them some they'd know
I'd expect something in return
I'd have to get drunk every night
And talk about virility
With some old grandmother
That might be decked out like a Christmas tree
And though pink elephants I'd see
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
Still I would sing my song to me
About the time they called me ""Jacky""

If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour

Became procurer of young girls
Then I would have my own bordellos
My record would be number one
And I'd sell records by the ton
All sung by many other fellows

And I'd sell boats of opium
Whiskey that came from Twickenham
Authentic queers
And phony virgins
If I had banks on every finger
A finger in every country
And every country ruled by me
I'd still know where I'd want to be
Locked up inside my opium den
Surrounded by some china men
I'd sing the song that I sang then

I'd sing for all the ladies up there
And they would sing along with me
And we be so happy there to be
Cause down below is really nowhere
My name would then be Juniper
Then I would know where I was going
And then I would become all knowing
My beard so very long and flowing
If I became deaf, dumb and blind
(was: If I could play deaf, dumb and blind)
Because I pitied all mankind
And broke my heart to make things right
I know that every single night
When my angelic work was through
The angels and the Devil too
Would sing my childhood song to me

Scott Walker,"Lady came from Baltimore
All she wore was lace
Didn't know that I was poor

Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none

Lady's name was Susan Moore
Daddy was the law
Didn't know that I was poor
And lived outside the law

Daddy said I was a thief
Didn't have the love
But I was Susan's true belief
Married her for love

I was there to steal the money
Take her rings and run

We're swallowed in the stomached rue
The only sound to tear the night
Comes from the man upstairs

His bloated belching figure stomps
He may crash through the ceiling soon
The window sees trees cry from cold
And claw the moon

But we know don't we
And we'll dream won't we
Of Montague Terrace in blue

The girl across the hall makes love
Her thoughts lay cold like shattered stone
Her thighs are full of tales to tell
Of all the nights she's known

Your eyes ignite like cold blue fire
The scent of secrets everywhere

Clutches all our cares

Scott Walker,"Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky, love
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down

The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone and the past is unknown
And there is no easy way down

No, it isn't very easy when you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy when each road you take
Is one more mistake, there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home, yeah

Where our fantasy world can be found

That there is no easy way down

Scott Walker,"Oh I can see them now
Clutching a handkerchief
And blowing me a kiss
Discreetly asking how
How came he died so young
Or was he very old
Is the body still warm
Or is it already cold
All doors are open wide
They grope around inside
At my desk my drawers my trunk
There's nothing left to hide
Some love letters are there
And an old photograph 
They've laid my poor soul bare
And now all they do is laugh

Oh I can see them all
So formal and so stiff
Like a sergeant at arms
At a policeman's ball
And everybody's pushing
To be the first in line
Their hearts upon their sleeves
Like a ten cent valentine
The old women are there 
Too old to give a damn
They've brought along the kids
Who don't know who I am
They're thinking about the price of my funeral bouquet
What they're thinking isn't nice
For now they'll have to pay

Oh I see all of you
All of my phony friends
Who can't wait for it ends
Who can't wait till it's through
Oh I see all of you
You've been laughing all these years
Now all that you have left
Are a few crocodile tears
Ah you don't even know
That you're entering your hell
As you leave my cemetery
You think you're doing well
With that one who's at your side
You're as proud as you can be
Ah she's going to make you cry
But not the way you cried for me

Oh I can see me now
So cold and so alone
As the flowers slowly die
In my field of little bones
Oh I can see me now
I can see me at the end
Of this voyage that I'm on
Without a love without a friend
Now all this that I see 
Is not what I deserve
They really have a nerve
To say these things to me

I saw him playing chess with Death yesterday
His crusade was a search for God and they say
It's been a along way to carry on

Anybody hear of plague in this town
The town I've left behind was burned to the ground
A young girl on a stake her face framed in flames cried
I'm not a witch God knows my name

The knight he watched with fear
He needed to know
He ran where he might feel God's breath
And in the misty church
He knelt to confess
The face within the booth was Mr. Death

My life's a vain pursuit of meaningless smiles
Why can't God touch me with a sign
Perhaps there's no one there answered the booth
And Death hid within his cloak and smiled

This morning I played chess with Death said the knight
We played that he might grant me time
My bishop and my knight will shatter his flanks
And still I might feel God's heart in mine

And through confession's grille Death's laughter was heard
The knight cried No you've cheated me!
But still I'll find a way
We'll meet once again and once again
Continue to play

They met within the woods the knight his squire and friends
And Death said now the game shall end
The final move was made
The knight hung his head
And said you've won I've nothing left to play

The minstrel filled with visions sang to his love
To look against the stormy sky
The knight his squire and friends
Their hands held as one
Solemnly danced toward the dawn

And as the thunder cracked they were gone",The Seventh Seal

We came riding through like warriors from afar
Our black horses danced upon the graves of yesterday's desires
Haunted by our visions framed in fire
I greet you, for you still believe in what's behind a door
You've seen the children freeze upon their knees
And praying to the wind
Descend their grey madonnas back again
Fire the guns, and salute the men who died for freedom's sake
And we'll weep tonight, but we won't lie awake
Gazing up at statues dressed in stars
We won't dream, for they don't come true for us
Not anymore
They've run afar to hide in caves
With haggard burning eyes
Their icy voices tear our hearts like knives

We came through
Like the Gothic monsters perched on Notre Dame
We observe the naked souls of gutters pouring forth mankind
Smothered in an avalanche of time
And we're giants as we watch our kings and countries raise their shields
And Guevara dies encased in their ideals
And as Luther King's predictions fade from view

Scott Walker,"Voices from a photograph
Laughed from your wall
Screamed through your dreams
Wake up Rosemary and wipe your teary eyes

Rise and cross the cold bare floor
And watch the moon through frosted glass
Damn that photograph
I'll have to take it down

She hears the boats as they move down the river
She sees a dog straining hard on his leash to get away
She hears the clock and it strikes like a hammer
Pounding the nails one day further in the coffin of her
youth

Evenings with your mother's friends
Pregnant eyes, sagging chins
Swollen fingertips
Pour antique cups of tea

Who are you and where you been?
Suspended in a weightless wind
Watching trains go by
From platforms in the rain

Look at the photograph
Dream back last summer
Dream back the lips
Of that traveling salesman, Mr. Jim

He smelled of miracles
With stained glass whispers
You loved his laughter
You tremble beneath him once again

That's what I want
A new shot at life
But my coat's too thin
My feet won't fly

And I watch the wind and I see another dream blowin' by",Rosemary
Scott Walker,"As the morning turned my way
See birds flying through this hazy face
And I came back here to replace your place in my life

And didn't you know that I'm not the world's strongest man
When it comes to you and your world I'm lost
Can't you see the towers of mine they could shine like a dime
Take me back again to your warm desire

And again again again
Longing for belongings here again
And I need your love you know I can't pretend anymore

Scott Walker,"Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was ameetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
 
She's forty one and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man
 
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride

Scott Walker,"The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smooths the restless sky 
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summer time
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arm ?

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

It was tragic how you almost died of pain when he was born
With no husband there beside you through it all
Ring the bell if you get hungry or you fall

You're a hero of the war
Why those teardrops on your cheek? it's so absurd

The Rhymes of Dimension, Surrounds us with fire and friends

That's still my Empire, And I've got a choice

It's healers of death,It still got a fire
And I keep it burning, with hands of desire

Can toll out the boundaries that level our lives

Can slash like the sunlight through shadows and cracks

And I feel like the tramp
Picking dustbins in the alley.
He looks up as I pass
Clutching rags from a city's restless night

I could read all my sadness
In faces I knew
Down at Kelly's bar last Friday
And I haven't been back since I mistook
Somebody for a friend

And if I walk these streets long enough
Will you happen to me again?
With whom are you sharing
The sweet taste of summer? 
My memories pursue you
Like puddles of rain
The river inside me still flow
To the sea of your hands

And if I close my eyes for a while
Will you happen to me again?",Two Weeks Since You've Gone
Scott Walker,"In my room, way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Thinking how lonesome I've grown, all alone
In my room

In my room, where very night is the same
I play a dangerous game
I keep pretending she's late
So I sit, and I wait

Over there is the picture we took when I made her my bride
Over there is the chair where I held whenever she cried
Over there by the window, the flowers she left - have all died

Scott Walker,"All my love's laughter
And all my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms

She's following after
The king of all places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
She walks without shining a light now

She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know till it's night

All my love's softness
And ll my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove

She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says, everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
She stands with her flock
All alone on the hill

Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning and you never will

Scott Walker,"There's a butterfly circling the beach
Searching the rocks where you are
He chooses your hair, and that's where he belongs

Dark rivers your eyes belong to no-one

Like a butterfly",Butterfly
Scott Walker,"If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be

There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
To make us realize our night is over

When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes
Against the sun that rises over the land

I watch you walk away
Somehow if have to let you go
Now it's over

If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget

Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over

So I turn my back
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all

I send my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
It's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be

There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
To make us realize our night is over

It's over

",It's Over
Scott Walker,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;

Drift a melody so strange and sweet

Paradise complete

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And your heart will find a safe and peaceful refuge

This broken hearted pain
I wouldn’t have to carry you around with me

But it seems like everywhere I go
There's somebody wants to know where you’ve been
And are you coming back again
I swear I can’t take you anywhere

So I left all alone, I just headed on home
As I listened to the messages on my telephone
There was one from my sister and one from an old friend
(Hey man, I drove by your house tonight, dude, but uh)

And dare to dance the tide

Scotty McCreery,"I dropped by to check on mama, for a minute
I could hear her humming a tune
Through the screen door in the kitchen
She was puttin' the final touches on a homemade pecan pie
And just like always I was, right on time

A little game of guess-who
And I got a hug and, ""How's my baby?""
I said, ""You know me mama,
I've been hittin' it hard and runnin' like crazy
But I don't wanna bore you with that same old nothing's-new,
I'd rather just pull up this chair and get caught up on you""

To get out of her hair and ditch this town
I was restless and time to move on
Now it's any reason to go back home
That's what's it all about
Yeah, I'm just slowin' down
And gettin' my feet back on the ground

That minute turned into an hour 'fore I knew it
And I got my fill on pie and how everybody's doing
I used to look for every reason in the world to hit that door
And she said, ""You want another cup of coffee?""

Outside our locker room after the game
Glowing in the tan you got that summer
I walked by and you said, ""Hey""
Yeah, that night's still clear as day

Big party down at Ricky Bowman's place
I walked up you threw your arms around me
And whispered you loved to watch me play
Yeah, that night's still clear as day

There ain't one second times erased
Every detail is still in place
You hold on to what you love
Some things never fade
And that night's still clear as day

I put my class ring by the cross on your gold chain
You backed my back against those cedar clapboards
And my lips ain't never been kissed that way

There ain't one second time's erased

Means a job and enough to eat""

I could still see her standing there like a dream
Flatbed stage on a little dirt track
She was second row, her hair pulled back

Spent a few weeks out on a lake shore beach
Carved our names high as we could reach
On an old wooden pier
We made plans we planned to keep
Three hundred miles from her to me and her senior year

Oh, she could've been mine
But we ran out of summertime

And of all the things I let get away
She's the one that keeps me awake at night
And I've never seen days go by so fast

If the days had only stayed that long
And those autumn leaves didn't have to fall
Oh, we'd have fell in love

Was just too right and just too real

Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

Say Hello to friends you know

It is the night of

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining

For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night

To love one another
His law is love and
His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in his name
All oppression shall cease

Let all within us
Praise his holy name

In the lane, snow is glistening

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird

As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, Are you married?
We'll say, No man
But you can do the job

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

'Cause I told my heart I had nothing to lose
When time ain't on your side

Said words to you I'd never heard me say
I just sat there that night
And let your Carolina eyes pull me in

If I'd only known a feeling like that
Would hit me once and it'd never come back
I'd of gone ahead and made you mine

A few years back in that little beach town

It seems like you were just right here
The sand was white, the coast was clear

Flip through the stations 'til we find a song

Find us a spot, watch the sun go down
Steal a little kiss, turn this truck around
Don't it make you wanna roll your window down?

Feel that summer breeze and watch the world go by

There is to hear 'bout a truck

When you're down on your luck
But don't get me wrong a summer song
Sounds good when you're on the shore
But every now and then I wanna dig in
And hear something that means something more

Like a mama's love even when she don't approve
Four generations sittin' on the same church pew
A soldier's first steps back through his own front door
Yeah, something that means something more

It's amazing how this old guitar
Can say so many things
It can laugh, it can cry
It can bring you fortune and fame
But now as I'm sittin' down strummin' out these chords
I'm praying that it's saying
Something that means something more

Like a long lost friend on the other end of the line
A daddy's eyes when he holds his baby for the first time
Grandpa goin' to meet Grandma and the Lord
Yeah, something that means something more

Saying ""I do,"" puttin' that ring on
Gettin' the news that the cancer's gone

Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more

I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighteen turned my helmet in and walked to the fifty yard line
Just the coach and me after we lost eighteen to nine
And I cried man next time to get in here I'll have to buy a ticket
Can't you give me five more minutes

With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

The mean looks and the same old frustrations

I may be scared and a little bit frightened
But I'll be back, I'll be coming back to life
I'll be coming back to life
