Great Guitars,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
",On Green Dolphin Street
Great Guitars,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When [Live]
Great Jazz Trio,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Great Jazz Trio,"Darlin', forever, forever
You can break my heart
Forever, if you want to
I'll play the part of a fool
Just to be with you forever

Forever, darling, forever
You can taunt me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
Just to be with you forever

I'll be your slave
For the rest of my days
Love you more in so many ways
Just to be with you thrills me through and through

And darlin', forever, forever
You can taunt me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
Just to be with you forever

Forever, forever, I'll love you so",Forever
Great Jazz Trio,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair",All in Love Is Fair

Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

Great Jazz Trio,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Great Jazz Trio,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Great Jazz Trio,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come
Great Jazz Trio,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Great Jazz Trio,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle

And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

Great Jazz Trio,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

Who tell you fate supplies a mate

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Hiding behind perfectly placed clouds
Because everything is the way it is
And everything is perfect in their imperfections
And everything is placed the best
And it is now, and it is here
And tomorrow is another now
Waiting to happen

The roar of an action silences all the words
The cry of an accomplishment
Drowns the whimper of ten thousand words
And we live in our actions and our reactions
And we live in our actions and our reactions",When It Flows
Great Lake Swimmers,"I was lost in the lakes
And the shapes that your body makes
That your body makes
That your body makes, that your body makes

And the mountains said I will find you here
They whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear
I traced my finger along your trails
And your body was the map, I was lost in it

Falling over your rocky spine
The glaciers made you and now you're mine
Falling over your rocky spine
The glaciers made you and now you're mine

I was moving across your frozen veneer
The sky was dark but you were clear
Could you feel my footsteps?
And would you shatter, would you shatter? Would you?

With your soft fingers between my claws
Like purity against resolve
I could tell then there we were formed from the clay
And came from the rocks for the earth to display

They told me to be careful up there
Where the wind rose up there, in this rage through your hair
They told me to be careful up there
Where the wind rages through your hair",Your Rocky Spine

Took my living and you took my friends
This is a time-bomb and it can happen anywhere

What if it was your way of life?

I bet you’d lose your mind too

You wanna see your sorrow

We were already on our knees

Light headin’ heavy and through the night
Half awake, found the wild in the wilderness
Under the starry sky of straights

Hanging until and rising as they fall
After a life, it came until tomorrow’s drive
Holding a stormy spinning wheel

And at the fight my words were strong

I drew a breath and I tried to find the courage
To stand the troubled trip. What have I gotten myself into?
I silently wondered, I silently asked

I thought of my family and thought of my love
I thought of my maker and what might be above
And the cabin in the woods that I have not yet build
Many other things that I hold dear in this world

I rode through the turmoil and rode through the strife
I held to my words and I clumped to my life
And then when my vision began to blur
This is what I saw in the thought that had occur

I saw every fish swimming fast beside me
And all kinds of leafs from all different trees
And all of the insects that circle on the earth
Birds and land animals are reaching towards birth

And I saw my body on a body of water
And I could see that we were the same
Roaring and reckless, invulnerable
Emotion and swinging and predisposed to changing

With stronger arms I silently swear
I silently drifted, I silently wept",On the Water

Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

Saw the child, the woman plain as day
I thought I knew myself
But now I come to find
Love is blind and I'm the lovin' kind

Bought a diamond and I
Set it on your hand
Introduced you to the band
And now I hear them say
You've been a bad girl baby
You don't seem to understand
Just for the social whirl
You play the party girl
Now you drink your wine
Oh baby time to forget

You made a game of love
What were you thinkin' of
It takes a heartbeat baby
To say goodbye",Lovin' Kind
Great White,"I know you think that you're one bad mother
Got no time for a rock 'n roll lover
You strut around like the original Queen of Sheeba
To I love you, you reply with, ""See ya""

But this is how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I know you won't come easily
But you're gonna give your love to me

This is how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I know your life is runnin' free
But you're gonna give your love to me

You got that face for a part in a devil's dream
You got that shape from a deal with a voodoo fiend
One of a kind, there surely ain't no other
Oh, don't you see we're made for one another ?

Great White,"'Bye New York, so long Philly
Hollywood your Wacko City
Chicago got just too damn windy for me
Frisco's fine apart from that line
New Orleans is just a good time
And southern belles can certainly ring my chimes
But my feet are achin' to feel the sand
Of the Golden Towns
We call 'em
South Bay Cities
Only place I call my home
South Bay Cities
Sweetest life I've ever known
If you can't find me baby
That breeze has gone and blown me home

I know she'll do just what she pleases for me

Think on better days
Life is rude, treats you bad
Tears your wings away

And sweep the past away

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

Hollywood ain't paved with gold
It's just a trick of light
Sunset falls on stars of old
And blinds you with its light
A spiders web of tangled lives
Lays stretched across the hills
From distances it's glistening
Like El Dorado's halls

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

The dream was light
And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scared
Where only fools find gold

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

Fly lonely angel
Spread your wings another way
Fly lonely angel
Find a better way

Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah

The heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda  beat

There's  blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat

So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned

Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.

Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time

Runs straight and high.

But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way
And I smell the rain and with it, came
And it's headed my way

Oh, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on and now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song, I'm goin' 'round the world I got to find my girl
I'm on my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreadin' roots
The time has come to be gone
And to our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on and now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song, I'm goin' 'round the world I got to find my girl
I'm on my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, find the queen of all my dreams, I tell no lies

Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air

T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair, but Gollum and the evil one
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
I had nothing I could do, no, I guess I'll keep on

Rambling, I'm gonna shake it
Gonna find my baby, I'm gonna ramble on
Sing my song, gonna work my way
Going 'round the world, ramble on yeah, yeah
Do, do, do, do my ramble on, yeah

I can't stop this feelin' in my heart
Every time I think about it till I'm having a ball
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep searchin' for my baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I keep on ramblin', baby, I keep on ramblin', baby

There can be no denyin' that the wind 'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flyin'. There's a new plague on the land
If we could just join hands (X3)
Traversed the planet when heaven sent me. I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight. I hear the rested rivers call
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe
If we could just join hands (X3)
You got me rockin' when I ought to be a-rollin'
Darlin', tell me, darlin', which way to go
You keep me rockin', baby, then you keep me stolen
Won't you tell me, darlin', which way to go... that's right
Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry and I would dearly like to know

Great White,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who standing looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven

When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die. My, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look...see
And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad, happiness...I'm glad
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you

Far away from mad desire

It's just a trick of light
Sunset falls on stars of old
And blinds you with its light
A spiders web of tangled lives
Lays stretched across the hills
From distances it's glistening
Like El Dorado's halls

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

The dream was light
And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scared
Where only fools find gold

High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

I've been doin' gigs since I was ten
I really can't remember when
I ever had a dollar to my name

I have bennies with the breakfast toast
Qualudes with the evening roast
Assorted snorts of powder in between
I don't think a day's gone by
That I wasn't drunk or high
It's the only way I keep my sanity

From Kegger's Den to Hooterville
My flaming tricks have topped the bill
A thousand empty bottles earn my name
Endless trains of one night stands
Sharing gigs with half-assed bands
And all the local groupies lay the same

Well I could have had a payin' job
Workin' for some fucked-up slob
Wife and family, true security
But I left that shit behind
For that heavy metal grind

Greater Vision,"I dreamed my life was done. I stood before god's son. 
It was time to see what my reward would be
With love he reviewed my life to count what was done for christ.
For that is what will last eternally

See I'd done my best to share that Jesus really cares
And he would save if they just believe
Oh, but seldom did harvest come and so few did I see won
Until the lord said, ""turn around and see.""

Then he showed me the faces of the ones who'd come because of me.
So many faces that my life had led to Calvary
All those years I thought nobody saw as I labored in lowly places
That's when Jesus smiled and showed me all the faces.

He said though you did not see the yield, you were faithful to plow the field
At other times you helped me plant the seed
No matter how small the task, you did just as I asked
And thanks to you these souls have been set free.


And for those years you thought nobody saw as you labored in lowly places
One day he'll smile and show you all the faces.

Am I evil, could it be, that I am the one they fear

No more hiding in the closet, waiting for him to sleep

Staring a hole through his soul 
There was blood underneath

From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that 'round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold

From the thunder and the storm,

Look at my friends and see what they've done
Ask my self why they've had to change

The clouds have fallen; here comes the rain

[Chorus x2]

Looking back upon my life
Faded memories on the wall
Looking now at who I am
I don't let it get me down

Looking back upon my life
And the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls I've loved
I try to remember when
But I don't let it get me down
Or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am
I always have tomorrow

Green Day,"Sitting in my room last night
Staring at the mirror
I couldn't find a reason why
I could be near her

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you say

Pictures going through my mind
When we're together
All these long and sleepless nights
Will I ever get better?

Now you know how I feel
This love is forever
You make my life feel so unreal
Will I ever get better?",The One I Want
Green Day,"I wish I could tell you
But the words would come out wrong
Oh, if you only knew
The way I felt for so long
I know that we're worlds apart
But I just don't seem to care
These feelings in my heart
Only with you I want to share

The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then my thoughts were only of you

I hope that when time goes by
You will think the same about me
Many nights awake I lie
I only wish that you could see
I know that we're only friends
I hope this feeling never ends
If I could only hold you
It's the only thing I want to do

The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then my thoughts were only of you",Only of You
Green Day,"Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone, and now it seems
As if I'll get some rest
But now and then I'll see you again
And it puts my heart to the test

So when are all my problems going to end?
I'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder
(Will this ever end?)
I find it hard to keep control
When you're with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too

So when are all my problems going to end?
I'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

So when are all my problems going to end?

I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
The gleam in your eyes

Will I see it again?

As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel, angel! Turning away
Just when thing seem
To have changed

Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?

Now many days have gone by
And you still just sit there and cry
You're feeling bad for yourself

You're so obsessed with his love

May I please speak with you
I'm having troubles with control
And it's all because of you
Today I kept on falling down
I thought it was the street
So I look down at my shoes
They were on the wrong feet

I find it hard to be myself
(can you please explain)
I do not think it's my health
(you're the one to blame)
You're the one I wish I had
And now my girlfriend is getting mad
(I cannot call this sane)

Today as I was walking down
You bumped into me
You said, ""excuse me"" and walked away
As I dropped to my knees
I prayed to the being in the sky
That my parents told me of
I asked about you but no reply
No clues about your love
My girlfriend left me on the phone
I'm pathetically left here alone

Green Day,"My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease
Someone called love
Not as long as there are
Girls like you

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me loose control
I just can't trust myself

If someone can hear me slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or bang it up against the wall

Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
No one wants to hear a drunken fool

I do not mind if this goes on
Cause now it seems I'm too far gone
I must admit I enjoy myself

Green Day,"Hey old man in woman's shoes
I wonder if he knows I think he's crazy
When he was young did he have dreams
Of wearing woman's shoes and being crazy?

It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change

Or will I grow that old?
Will I still be around?
The way I carry on I'll end up
Six feet underground
And waste away...

When the old man was in school
Did the golden rule make him go crazy
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope
It's crazy

It seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning

It keeps my head spinning around.",Android

Doing things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town -- Best thing around

I'm seeing faces...
Of mystery's of the earth
I am not one ...
To the aspersions of my birth
Or go to stance...
Of hallucinations I can't find
A missing piece...

And no one can touch you?
Well I think you're disposable
And it's time you knew the truth
Cause it's just one of my lies!

Why does my life have to be so small?
Yet death is forever
And does forever have a life to call its own?

Don't give me an answer cause you
Only know as much as I know

He ran the drug cartel in ""Tinseltown""
They found him in a Cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat in the name

She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virgina and the dope
And kissed the bride eternally

Its groping on your leg until it sleeps

Call old whats her name

She's the symbol
Of resistance
And she's holding on my
Heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreaming
What I'm thinking
Is she the mother of all bombs
Gonna detonate

Is she trouble
Like I'm trouble
Make it a double
Twist of fate
Or a melody that

Sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's salt of the earth
And she's dangerous

With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
Cigarettes and Ramen and a little bag of dope

Raised in the city under a halo of lights

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?

A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Don't go for second best baby

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic

You deserve the best in life

Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

And a smile can hide all the pain

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end

I had to fall
To lose it all

Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves

With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allen Poe
Raised in the city under a halo of lights
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized

Of the 7-11 were I was taught
The motto was just a lie

It says home is where your heart is

It's beating out of time

At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned

Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care

Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall

It didn't say much but it only confirmed
That the center of the earth is the end of the world

And stashed behind your couch

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind","Wake Me Up When September Ends [Live at Foxboro, Ma 9/3/05]"

Sit down! And the black girls

And it's non-denominational
Join the choir we will be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Oh bless me Lord for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in ""the river of a shadow of doubt""
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a god damned thing

Green Day,"Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized
Stand up! All the white boys
Sit down! And the black girls
You're the soldiers of the new world

Put your faith in a miracle
And it's non-denominational
Join the choir we will be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Oh bless me Lord for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in ""the river of a shadow of doubt""
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a god damned thing

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Don't test me
Second guess me
Protest me
You will disappear

I want to know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
Missionary politicians
And the cops of a new religion

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside

Green Day,"She
She screams in silence
A sulley roit penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign to smash the silence with the brick of self control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

She
She's figured out 
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Waking up this time to smash the silence with the brick of self control

Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?

Green Day,"Dear mother
Can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks
Since I left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
'Cause now it seems that I
Am out there on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through
A wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and
Left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through
A wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

Dear mother
Can you hear me laughing?
It's been six whole months since that
I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here

Green Day,"I heard you crying loud, all the way across town
Cause you been searching for that someone
And it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now, and dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get
So uptight you been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Well, I heard it all before, so don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right

So go do what you like, make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing 
Was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around

Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop when the red lights flash

Won't you take me close to you

Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose

Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose

Oh lights and action
I just can't be satisfied
Oh losers and choosers
Won't you please hold on my life
Oh hours and hours
Like the dog years of the day
Old story, same old story
Won't you see the light of day

Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose

Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose

Talk myself out of feeling
Talk my way out of control
Talk myself out of falling in love

Green Day,"I was alone
I was all by myself
No one was looking
I was thinking of you

Oh yeah, did I mention
I was all by myself
All by myself, all by myself
All by myself

I went to your house
But no one was there
I went in your room
I was all by myself

You and me had
Such wonderful times
When I'm all by myself

Green Day,"Princess in the school girl's dream
May I please speak to you?
I'm having troubles with control
And it's all because of you

Today I kept on falling down
I thought it was the street
And so I look down at my shoes
They were on the wrong feet

And I'll find it hard to be myself
Oh, can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health
You're the one to blame

You're the one I wish I had and
Now my girlfriend's getting mad
I cannot call this sane
I cannot call this sane

Today as I was walking down
You bumped down on me
You said, ""Excuse me"" but walked away
As I dropped to my knees

I prayed to the being in the sky
That my parents told me of
I asked about you but no reply
No clues about your love

And I find it hard to be myself
Oh, can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health
You're the one to blame

My girlfriend left me on the phone
I'm pathetically left here alone
I cannot call this sane
I cannot call this sane

Oh, can we find a way?
So that you can stay
I think I'm gonna pop

I find it hard to be myself
And can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health
You're the one to blame

You're the one I wish I had and
Now my girlfriend's getting mad

Green Day,"Is your heart singing out of tune
Are your eyes just singing the blues
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes

No one really knows about your soul
And I barely really know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
And a bunch of fools drown in shame

Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah, please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?

Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harms way?
Warding off all evil signs
But it never really kept you safe

Now you're too young for the golden age
'Cause the record bin's been replaced
Twenty seven, gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink

Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah, please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?

Amy please don't go
Amy please don't go

Is your heart singing out of tune
Are you eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes

May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby?
So we can sing you to sleep

Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah, please don't go

Do you wanna be a friend of mine?

Green Day,"Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now you’re crying out bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Used a tangled mind with your puppet strings
You tangled your desires right in front of my face
You let me into the world but wouldn’t let me drink
Swallowing my pride and I never even got the taste

But time comes around and I’m not so naive
I’ve finally lost touch 'cause you’re so out of reach
You say that you’re fine but I know that you ain’t
You’re looking like hell and you’re no fucking saint

Now you’re crying out bloody murder

Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

You are what you are
A wish on a shooting star
You are a filthy thought
In my memory

I’ve tasted cigarettes and liquor on your breath
we used to call it speed but now it’s crystal meth
Like when I loved you but you’re scaring me to death
This careless memory and now I could care less

But time comes around and I’m not so naive
I’ve finally lost touch 'cause you’re so out of reach
You say that you’re fine but I know that you ain’t
You’re looking like hell and you’re no fucking saint

Green Day,"Well I met girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beats screams sinning clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes

She just wants to get me high
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like a loss to temptation,
Living on my inner demons

I don't wanna suicide,
I don't want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight
Do you wanna play a game of twister
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter

I don't wanna suicide,
I don't want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

I don't wanna make you cry
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawin' blood and lonely stars
Drink and kiss for cheap guitars

I just wanna be your friend

And I can’t sleep tonight ’cause I’m so tired

I can’t take it anymore
With all the liars
Like a prisoner of war
I don’t want your sympathy
I don’t want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind

As I roll over and play dead
I don’t want to hear it anymore

It’s good to see you but I really must admit
There’s an odor in the air and I think you look like shit

Don't be afraid, boy, to come inside
I got the thing that you want, the fix that you need

Sounds like love but you know it won't last
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route
Red velvet walls
Line the sugar-coated halls
Girls on your bar stools from late last calls
This town is filled with snakes, mistakes and whiskey shakes
It's too late I already cut the brakes

I'm rollin', strollin' into town
Is it me or am I going crazy?
This dirty city is my sugar town
My little angel of death is my nightlife

You better make a move before I get bored
If you wanna explore my vocal chord
Leave the girl a go-go dance in the cooch
One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch
Why don't you stick around for one more round?
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown
'Cause I'm a ring leader
I run the show
And only when I tell ya
Will it be time to go

Don't be stubborn like some ole fool

Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Greg Abate,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

How tears can burn one's heart
But that's a thing that I found out
Too late I guess, Cause I'm in a mess

Why lead me on this way?
I thought there'd be no price on love
But I had to pay.

If I could perform one miracle
I'd revive your thoughts of me
Yet I know that it's hopeless
You could never really care.
That's why I despair!

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.

Greg Brown,"When I was a bachelor, I liv'd all alone
I worked at the weaver's trade
And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong
Was to woo a fair young maid.
I wooed her in the wintertime
Part of the summer, too
And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong
Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew.

One night she knelt close by my side
When I was fast asleep.
She threw her arms around my neck
And she began to weep.
She wept, she cried, she tore her hair
Ah, me! What could I do?
So all night long I held her in my arms
Just to keep her from the foggy foggy dew.

Again I am a bachelor, I live with my son
We work at the weaver's trade.
And every sing time I look into his eyes
He reminds me of that fair young maid.
He reminds me of the wintertime
Part of the summer, too,
And the many, many times that I held her in my arms
Just to keep her from the foggy, foggy, dew.

When I was just a child in Momma's arms
My daddy plowed the fields and prayed and did all he could do
To save that broke-down Oklahoma farm

Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my momma
That he finally saved enough for us to go
California was his dream, a paradise that he had seen
The pictures and the magazines had told him so

[Chorus]
California cotton fields, where labor camps were filled with worried men and broken dreams
California cotton fields was as close to wealth as Daddy ever came

Almost everything we owned was sold or left behind
From Daddy's tools to the fruit that Momma canned
Some folks came to say farewell and see all we had to sell
Some just came to shake my Daddy's hand

But the only change that I remember seein' in my daddy
Was when his brown hair turned to silver gray

Echoes of ages in canyons of rust,
Is heaven so lonely? I'll know soon enough

Cold as the clay, dark as a mine,
Wasting away blood, sweat, and grime
Panning for gold, picking for dimes, lying in wait for better times

The tools of the trade lie shopworn and old
The skills of the master done died with his soul
And the worklike routine is so lonely and cold

Cold as the clay, dark as the mine,
Wasting away, blood, sweat and grime,
Panning for gold, picking for dimes, lying in wait for better times

The village expanded, some say it's improved,

Bummed a ride home, got in to bed, 44 smokeless under my head

I began to think what the deed I'd done, grabbed my hat and away'd I run,
Made a good run just a little too slow, (they) overtook me in Jericho

Standin' on the corner, ringin' the bell, up walks the sheriff from Thomasville
Says ""young man is your name Brown? 'Member that night you shot Sadie down?""

Oh yes sheriff my name is Lee, I murdered little Sadie in the first degree,
First degree, second degree, if you got any papers you can read 'em to me

Took me downtown, dressed me in black, put me on a train and they sent me back,
Had no one for to go my bail, (they) crammed me back in the county jail

Would drown,
It was on one Thursday morning the rain came pouring down and they searched for Omie's body but it
Nowhere could be found,
Two boys went a fishin' one fine summer day and they saw little Omie's body go floating away

They called for John Lewis to come to that place so he could see her body and they could see his face,
Though he made no confession they threw him in jail, no friend nor relation would go on his bail

Greg Graffin,"Oh the lilies were laid on the marble in the field where the ancestors lay,
And the forest was dark and primeval but the boughs seemed to cradle as they swayed,
And the church choir sang hallelujah, and the vernal breeze whispered a sigh,
Watch the brethren all stand, praise their God, raise your hand,
Tow the bell for the Rebel's goodbye

When the boots hit the dirt in formation the mood was determined and bright,
And a young, hopeful boy at the station watched the train carry troops to the fight,
But the generals died by assassins, the battalions dispersed on the fly,
And they paid for their sins with the blood of their kin,
Tow the bell for the Rebel's goodbye

In the dark heathen barracks of failure where the tormenters wait for the night,
And the sheltering sky hears their lost, tattered cries,
Tow the bell for the Rebel's goodbye

Greg Graffin,"Oh, yonder stands the prophet, words are music to our ears,
But down among the sinners, only pain and sweat and tears

The sermon soothes the simple but the rest are rapt with fear,
Oh no, too late to hold a trial, time doesn't wait for the watchmaker's dial

In the best laid plans of history lie the ruins of the past
And a chronicle of suffering shows the mythic pall they cast

To believe is true religion but to see is truth at last
Oh no, too late to hold a trial, time doesn't wait for the watchmaker's dial

Time doesn't wait for the watchmaker's dial

Greg Graffin,"Willie Moore was a young man, his age 21
And he courted a damsel fair
Her eyes were as white as a diamond after night
And a wavy jet black wore her hair

He courted her night and day
Until marriage they did agree
But when he came to get her parents consent
They said it could never be

She threw herself in Willie Moore's arms
As often she'd done before
And little did he think when he left her that night
Sweet Annie he would see no more

It was about the 10th of May
A time I remember it well
That very same night little Annie disappeared
In a way no tongue could tell

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near
She had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home
The body of sweet Annie were found

Her parents now are left alone
One mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door
The body of sweet Annie sleeps

Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say
From the moment they both did part
And his last day was spent near his true lover's grave
Where he died of a broken heart",Willie Moore

Pressed against the window pain,

Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops

You won't know what's hit you, it'll happen so fast,
won't be the time to even scream.
You'll just be burned up by the heat of the blast,
a thing of the past in a nuclear attack.
A nuclear attack,
you may never come back from a nuclear attack.
You'll never come back from a nuclear attack.
The world will just crack.
There's no turning back from a nuclear attack.

Greg Lake,"She looked at me across the room
Emerging from a silk cocoon
Along beneath venetian chandeliers
Against the moon her body rocks
Her eyes were cunning like a fox
The wings of passion fly on all frontiers

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
No one is to smart
In affairs of the heart

Now upon the bridge she waits
Dreaming of our tangled fates
Her face was like a ghost with eyes of jade
I fell just like a falling star
A victim of this coup d'etat
I could not see behind this masquerade

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
Be careful where you start
In affairs of the heart

Sometimes I think I'll never learn
Were all those promises in vain
Do the wings of fire still remain

All is fair in love and war
The tender draw the shortest straw
Like autumn leaves they vanish in the air
Is this the time we say good-bye
I call her room there's no reply
Tonight we end this fleeting love affair

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
Sharper than a dart
In affairs of the heart",Affairs Of The Heart
Greg Lake,"I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe this smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance
And incidence arose from circumstance
One thing lead to another we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

And now you find yourself in eighty two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can't concern yourself with bigger things
You catch the pearl and ride the dragon's wings

'Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, the heat of the moment
Shone in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself
Teenage ambition you remember well

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

It was the heat of the moment
The heat of the moment, heat of the moment
Shone in your eyes

I'll bring your words along with me
Maybe one day they will mean something

For now they buzz and crumble down
A little bit too easily
From a time that I am not quite over
What the hell is wrong with me?

I might be gone a little while
I guess we'll see
I gotta make a home outta somewhere
And you're all over this city

And it'll take a flight to figure out
Where I'm gonna finally land
And the time it takes for me get there
I'll be one to start again

But I should probably say that I'm unsure why I'm running
Running away from the only thing I want
Yeah, I should probably say that I'm unsure why I'm running
Running away from the one I love

And if the plane lifts off
I'll write you a letter to say goodbye
And I will make it long and maybe lie just a little
Tell you that I'm doing fine

Then I'll send it out and let things be
If not for you
For me and for the time I've spent
Foolishly loving thee

Greg Long,"I was just a child, when I felt the Savior leading
I was drawn to what I could not understand
And for the cause of Christ
I have spent my days believing

What He'd have me be is who I am
As I've come see the weaker side of me
I've realized his grace is what I need
When sin demanded justice for my soul

Mercy said no, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no, sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank you Jesus
Mercy said no

For God so loved the world that He sent His Son to save us
From the cross He built a bridge to set us free
Oh, but deep within our hearts
There is still a war that rages

And makes the sacrifice so hard to see
As midnight fell on crucifixion day
The light of hope seemed oh so far away
And as evil tried to stop redemption's flow

Mercy said no, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no, sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face

It's through the blood of Jesus
Reminding me of one day long ago

Greg Long,"They were young and they were free
There were twelve men who believed
In a man who asked them to leave
It all behind and follow me

So they set out on this journey
Not knowing where He would lead
But soon they would see clearly
What the price would have to be

That day would come
When they would choose to live or give their lives away
They could have run
But with their final breath Heaven heard them say

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark
We'll follow you anywhere
We love you Jesus

We don't see Him with our eyes
Can't touch the scars that are on His side
Still we feel Him in our souls
And now we know that He's alive

And our message is the same
As the twelve who made the way
With a faith that God will live inside
Of those who call His name

The day has come
To lose ourselves and give our lives away
All for the One
Who's in our hearts, we raise our hands

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September

Greg Poppleton,"Times have changed
And we've ofter rewound the clock
Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing of Plymouth rock
Plymouth rock would land on them

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows
Anything goes

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(if any brains you've got)
From those little radios

So Mrs. R.
With all her trimmin's
Can broadcast a bed from Simmon's
Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes",Anything Goes
Greg Poppleton,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""

Of that wonderful kiss.

Should do, Baby;

Say it won't, won't, won't

Come true, baby,
My heart begins to hum,

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.

Sweets we've tasted before
Cannot stand an encore.
You know that a miss
Who always gives a kiss
Would soon become a bore.

I can't see that at all,
True love never should pall.

I was only teasing;
What you did was pleasing.
Oh,

Yet you hold me anyway and
I won't a step unless it's your direction
Where was I, before i finally realized

And you're inches away
There's a tone in your voice and
It makes me feel brave
There's a glow in my eye's
That shows I'm alive

Yeah, Greg Street's mixtape

[Verse One: Boondox]
Uh uh
I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Street grinders, paper chasin scrapin busters
By keepin dust up noses and caine homes; pipes and cans
So they want they ride candy painted just like the man
That Veta tryin not to bite his hand
But they need em to keep em life from they stand
Every night praying for praying go as far as the ceiling
Got me feel like I'm (cursed) from this heart that I'm dealing
And all this liquor hoeing brother and goose-neckin
That I do but I don't want to got me losing blessings
GOD said he'll take the next two steps if I take the first (I did)
But in it to pick and sellin the spur
From under my feet, lost faith and jump in the street
Back to serve a rocks dying to the chrome in the heat
And running with G's that take it to the block with 'em
Tellin me along with my greens up like pot nickel

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
You can clock my consistent and endless
Efforts up uplift me
Trees and branches catch draft
When I'm choppin down a path-
To walk down, actually don't even know how talk sound
I'm trying to stop the next step they drawing the chalk round
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
I'll pimp prophets so profounding labels don't like contract me
I'm one of a kind; they gotta find a satellite to contact me
Let us bow, I thank the Almighty GOD for right now
For the strictor, smile through the tribulation and trial
For sparing me when the devil was daring me
And scaring me, synonymous for preparing me
And to my family- the Dungeon Family
And ya'll family-- we all family
And to me health and home and my son Keith Stun
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun
(Whaa)

Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before

Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Three: Kalage]
All I know is charge cards, cars, and clothes
Maan, it's all for sure
And could go and when it's gone- (you alone)
Runnin up yo cell phone callin GOD for hope
And who to say that day ain't all for close
And if you ballin playa, it's only because GOD's your coach
And it don't bout the lies you hold, laws you broke
Thangs ya drink, dank and cigars you smoke
HE gonna forgive and that's you; now don't get me wrong
I like LL, but GOD da G.O.A.T'
HE da greatest of all time, if I'm lying I'm blind
Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
But we got to stop, we got to stop doin dirt
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sittin some leather from Atlanta, came up finish the prayer
Worried about sister mom's and hair
All along worried bout what sister mom gonna wear
This ya boy or should they ride the martyr there
It don't matter at least that's the moral there
In Sunday service with a Bible lie defer the South
But GOD bless her, we here to thank GOD (hmmmm ahhh)
And that's the step inside Holy Church thinkin
I said step inside his Holy Church thinkin
We all God's Property, and not just Kirk Franklin

Put out some Henn for my friend, why the good die?
But til the end, I'm in the wind where the slug fly
Pray for my sins, I hope I find Heaven close to me
Try to be godly but these haters provokin me
Pull the shotty want them dead is what my heart say
My hard head make me learn shit the hard way
Dodging the fedz ain't the easy way to live, care
But nigga do it everyday to make a meal stack
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
And fucking ladies, who making babies used against you
Gettin the ?? be the main nigga you be a friend too
How can begin to explain the pain
Can you stay in the rain
Used to be a simple thing, but the game done changed
Now slanging caine is a lifestyle
Risking your freedom just to ball for a short while
Gettin buckwild on the street up on Westside
Downtown Atlanta, while we ride some of the best die
From cocking hammers of these Tec-9s and .45s
Excuse my grammar; but it's fucked up how time fly
It seem like yesterday we play until our days was nights
And yesterday, I just put flowers at his gravesite and that ain't right

[Outro: Kalage]
All I know
Is I'd been down this road before
This ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray",All I Know

Get back when I can just playin' my part
Church folk had a fish fry
Mustard, hot sauce, light bread, and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bops
Last night I hit the pick tree bought some Air Force ones

I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play
Make call to the sticks say I'm headin' dat way
Heard my cousin cookin out I gotta get me a plate
Got new outfit ain't even out in the states
So if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day
And these dickies got me sitin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and grin on my face
My grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm a okay

Take a day off hit park and just hang
Barbque roll a few and put up your dukes
If it's beef put down the peace up and put down your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good break out your click and grip your wood
And if you ridin' dirty just light your swift and blow your sss
But dot real big exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24's do your thang and rep your hood
The world is all yours
But still we all bound forever
In a day the choice you make is relly all fine

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping

Is wonderful, wonderful

So she never sleeps a wink
The trains run all night
Give her plenty time to think

About the love that she had
To a man brave and true
And how that love turned bad
The way love's bound to do

They'd have candle light meals
They'd drink wine from Bordeaux
They'd make love every night
The moon hung low

But he stopped coming home
He stopped paying the bills
She had to move to this house
By the tracks down the hill

She'd call her mom and her dad
But they wouldn't understand
They'd say what did you do
To that hard working man

She'd call her brother down south
But he'd never call her back
He's got his house down a hill
Next to his own railroad tracks

So what happens now
What should she do?
She can't fall asleep
And dream a love brand new

Up in the air
She sees birds and planes
You know she'd go anywhere
To get away from these trains

'Cause whenever you come on by
You welcome me over your shoulder
Then you hang me out to dry

Are you mean because it's in your nature?
For me it's kind of hard to tell
The boys say, ""Can't you see she hates you?""
I think you're lonely as a cheap motel

But in your eyes, tell me what I see
Just a hint of love peeking out at me
I don't care how small just a little taste
Might not be for me at all
But Alice, don't let it go to waste

Alice, you would walk for miles
For the chance to put me in my place
Beg me to come a little closer
Then you tell me I'm a big disgrace

Your mama was a double martini
And your daddy gave up wearing clothes
Now you're as cold as the Arctic Circle
Living where nobody goes

But in your eyes, tell me what I see
Just a hint of love peeking out at me
I don't care how small, just a little taste
Might not be for me at all
But Alice, don't let it go to waste

And say I've got it easy
If this is easy
I'll take a bite out of my shoes

And I'm feeling pretty weary
But I'll be just fine
Once I dream away these blues

I got nothing to say
And I'm looking like a scarecrow
You say I'm wasting away
And you don't care if I do

I'm just a bit tired
And lack a little motivation
But I'll be just fine
Once I dream away these blues

I'll be a dancing child
I'll be the Hallelujah chorus
Turn the TV on
I'll be the breaking news

I just need some time
To shake off half a century
Back in the world I'll climb
Once I dream away these blues

So come on, babe
Don't look so disheartened
Unlike before
These dreams will come true

So fill my glass
The wine will help me get started
I'll be coming back fast
Once I dream away these blues

I'll be a dancing child
I'll be the Hallelujah chorus

Once again when you got home from work
Well, you know I did too
I got 'em hurt by you

We yelled like little kids
At the stupid little things, we both did
And I made you cry
Then punched the sky

We let it go on so very long
Pretending like there's nothin' wrong
We both moved underground
And forgot about the love, we once found

You work your fingers numb
From before the dawn to the setting sun
I've gone away somewhere
We make a lonely pair

You got your feelings hurt
And now you don't know, what would be worse
Livin' separately
Or just unhappily

There might be somethin' we didn't try
We could talk about the way, we both feel inside
Tears might fall, tempers fly
We might try to get acquainted before we say goodbye

Did her heart start that low?
Did she always believe
Love always deceives?
Was it always so?

No matter what you do
She'll pay no mind to you
To make her know you care
Is futile as a prayer

She's a mining town
After the mine's shut down
Coal turned to diamonds
She won't let you find them

Once in a long, long while
She might attempt a smile
But it works in reverse

Shuffle, panic madly up and down the line
Hoppers, dopers, sober smokers confounding everybody
Treating everyone so kindly except themselves sometimes

Weathers-beaten, losin' cheatin' singin' taller stories
Satisfaction guaranteed if you hit the note tonight
Morning coffee allegory keep our engines running
Your loving something always trumps those things we never tried

Got a line and a pole and a dry fishing hole
And I start to pack it in, then I think of you my friends

Sleepers, weepers, faithless leapers up to ten, 12 inch speakers
Send them in to Karl, they'll need an overhaul
Tin pan alley, Rand Mac Nally read my fortune long tall sally
We might have missed the boat but we all made it to the ball

Making something out of nothing heart a pounding
Stomach rumbling, everyone I meet, everywhere I go
Hackers, slackers, sixteen trackers someone pass the telecaster
And if you've got to ask well there's a chance you'll never know

There's house in a town where only ghosts can be found
And I feel like moving in till I think of you my friends

Paper pushers, talent brokers, no they're not all thieves and hookers
Out of luck, out of work, never out of dreams
So where for art thou romeo, we'd even take a cameo
Just point us to the station and put us on the train

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gregg Allman,"Got on a bus in Memphis
Destination Rome
Georgia ain't no paradise
But a place I just call home

I sat next to a broken hearted bride
She was cryin', tryin' so hard to hide
Her selfish sorrow

I tried to get her talkin'
She didn't have much to say
She asked me for a map to death row
But I didn't know the way

She had lost a million in the game
One look out the window
At the pine trees and the rain
It wasn't her day

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever seen
Multicolored lady
Angry red, passion blue
But mostly shades of green

Midnight came and brought more rain
Nothing seemed to ease her pain
The hours that we talked
Seemed like minutes all in vane

I watched
As her tears kept runnin' wide
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while
She started smilin'

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever known
Multicolored lady
Come go with me, I'll take you to my home

Oh, by the way, I'm bound for Rome

'Cause oh, somehow it means so much to me
And if you ever need me, you know just where I'll be
So please call home, if you change your mind

I guess I saw it comin', day by day
But oh, I could not stand the failure
Before you leave, there's just one thing I must say
Please call home, if you change your mind
Oh, I don't mind

And I know, that you're used to runnin'
Oh you're lost baby, and I ain't funnin'
But oh, when you call to me, well, I'll come runnin'
Safe to your side, again I'll confide in you

So go ahead on, I won't say no more
My heart ain't in it but I'll hold the door
But just remember what I said before
Please call home, if you change your mind

Please call home, if you change your mind
Please call home, if you change your mind

Always happy never sad
And every day
Seemed like Sunday
And although things were slow
Never seemed to have no dough
Somehow, I never once got lonely

You're gamblin' with your own happiness
And most all your would be friends
Turn out so phoney
Oh but times they change
And rearrange

And I'll sing to the Queen of Hearts
Don't know where to start
Or how to stop

And after things have come and gone
Left me feelin'
That I've done so wrong
Oh, I wasted so much time
Feelin' guilty
And as I watch you sit across the room
Beautiful as the flowers bloom
T'Leave it lay just one day
Oh brother you're gonna come back
To find it gone

I love you queen of Hearts
Tell me not to stop
Just tell me where
To start
Where now baby
Tell me where to start

And after all that we've been through
I find that when I think of you
A warm soft wind runs
Through and through
And in my heart
There's only you
And I will always keep on trying
To gather this strange piece of mind
Without it there'd be
Lonely me and
Oh darlin' lonely you

Lets go to memphis in the meantime baby

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I wanna trade in these ol country boots
For some fine italian shoes

Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We dont need none of that
Just a little dabll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat

Until hell freezes over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I dont think ronnie milsaps gonna ever
Record this song

Maybe theres nothin happenin there
Maybe theres somethin in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big ol whiff

If we could just get off-a that beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the rendez-vous

cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, its gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin

And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come back home
Put the cowhorns back on the cadillac
And change the message on the cord-a-phone

All I got here is this rendezvous with the blues

The clock says 10 past 2
But I can't sleep 'cause I gotta keep
My rendezvous with the blues

Well, the telephone keeps on ringing
Why can't that be you?
I pick it up too late now I gotta to make
My rendezvous with the blues

In your eyes you turn away
And there's nothing as loud

Evidence of love, to keep me going
Show me some evidence of love
And I'll be here

Is it saying good-bye?

And kickin back, feelin' real good, real fine, real full of the wine
And everything's fine, everything's beautiful, everything's great
And I just feel so good, you know I'm seventy years old and
I'm slurpin' everything through a straw
I'm sittin' here on the back porch just eatin' chocolate pudding through a straw
And I heated it up on a little sterno stove, tastes just like a warm body fluid 
goin' down
Little players comin' 'round, pluggin' in their instruments, feelin' good about
Themselves, singin' original songs, by the original masters
And I'm sittin' there on the porch, rockin' back 'n' forth in my little old 
chair
But I'm an old man on the back porch, old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch, and that old man is me
Old man on the back porch, old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch, and that.....

Gregg Stafford,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing

Gregg Stafford,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream

You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Thin or fat, young or old;
Shake their shoulders bold.
You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.

Celui que tu appelles
Dans tes soirs de déprime
Quand l'espoir se fait la belle

Je suis celui qui reste
Quand l'ennui assassine
Qui veut bien faire les tests
Pourris des magazines

Je suis la bonne oreille
Qui sait tout de ta vie
Et quand tu as sommeil
Celui qui veille tes nuits

Mais serai-je autre chose un jour
Si la question se pose
Si le cœur me l'impose
Sait on jamais si j'ose un jour
Devenir autre chose, devenir autre chose
Autre chose

Je suis l'ami d'enfance
La voix du réconfort
Et qui prend ta défense
Que t'aies raison ou tort

Je suis un peu ton père
Celui qui te protège
Quand ils se font la paire
Pour une autre blanche neige

Je suis là quand il faut
Et j'accepte aussi bien
Quand tu me tournes le dos
Parce que tu vois quelqu'un

Mais serai-je autre chose un jour
Si la question se pose
Si le cœur me l'impose
Sait on jamais si j'ose un jour
Devenir autre chose, devenir autre chose

Et tu me parles de toi
Et tu me parles d'eux
Parfois je parle de moi
Mais parlons de nous deux

Serons-nous autre chose un jour
Si la question se pose
Si le cœur nous l'impose
Il faudra que l'on ose un jour

Une odeur sur mon drap, une tâche sur ma chemise,
Une photo perdue dans un étrange vide
Des détours dans ta rue, un t-shirt, quelques rides.

Ce qu'il reste de toi, un jour de février,
Un invisible froid, des souvenirs à trier,
Ta chaleur sur le sable, des batailles dans la neige,
Un sentiment coupable, mon âme qui te protège.

Je mets des peurs à m'en remettre,
Plus que des bruits, des kilomètres,
J'égare un peu ce qu'il reste de moi,
Au milieu de ce qu'il reste de toi,
J'égare un peu ce qu'il reste de moi
Au milieu de ce qu'il reste de toi.

Ce qu'il reste de toi, un regard sur ce pont,
Un bateau qui s'en va vers un autre horizon,
Un pauvre jour de pluie, seuls comme des bancs publics,
Le son de notre ennui aux mauvaises acoustiques.

Ce qu'il reste de toi, une si longue absence
Qui se moque de moi, une éternelle danse,
Un début d'utopie, le chaos de ta peau
Dans l'enfer de mes nuits, le sommeil en morceaux.

Je mets des peurs à m'en remettre,
Plus que des bruits, des kilomètres,
J'égare un peu ce qu'il reste de moi,
Au milieu de ce qu'il reste de toi,
J'égare un peu ce qu'il reste de moi

On est de la même terre mais pas du même monde.
Quel enfer de se taire,
Mais comment se parler ne serait-ce qu'une seconde,

Des préjugés, des codes, des barrières.

Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un concours de circonstances,
Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un doute, une coïncidence.
J'ai le corps qui t'appelle et le cœur qui te pense,
Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,
Donne moi une chance.

On s'évite, ça excite,
Bien sûr l'indifférence attise les envies,
Tes regards qui s'égarent,
On a beau le vouloir, l'autre nous l'interdit,
Et l'on part,
Mais dis moi où peut-on se revoir.

Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un concours de circonstances,
Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un doute, une coïncidence.
J'ai le corps qui t'appelle et le cœur qui te pense,
Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,

Apprendre à se connaître, un jour, un soir,
Et si nos âmes s'attirent,
Ne plus rien s'interdire
Et puis voir, ce qu'on peut devenir.

Il se relève et règne en maître
C'est vous qui l'avait fait renaître

Et dans vos bras je suis quelqu'un
Je n'ai plus besoin d'avoir peur

Ces matins qui gardent en otage,
Nos envies au fond d'un sommeil

Plier les rêves que l'on bégaye.

J'ai l'horizon dans mes bagages,
Des aventures à t'inventer,
Pas de frontières, autres péages,
Pas de limite à s'en aller,
Au-delà de nos marécages

Où jamais rien ne nous soulage

Où la vie n'est jamais pareille,
On se perdra sur des rivages,
Dans des océans de merveilles,
On fera peut-être naufrage,
Je crois qu'il faut que l'on essaye,
Atteindre d'autres paysages,
Des galaxies inexplorées.
Ne plus sentir geindre la rage,
Ni l'entendre se lamenter,
Oublier les sombres ravages,
De leurs principes et leurs idées
En trouvant un pont, un passage,
N'importe quoi pour s'évader.

Quelques hommes quelques femmes rêvant de liberté
On n'était pas à vendre
Mais on pouvait revendre des montagnes d'amitié
Le cœur en bandoulière
Et les bras grand ouvert à tous les étrangers
On n'avait pas de peur
On sentait la chaleur qu'on savait se donner

Même au fin fond du désert
On aidait les plus faibles à ne jamais tomber
Même au milieu des chimères
On y croyait plus fort quand le courage manquait

Pour vous mes compagnons mes amis de jeunesse
Quelques soient vos histoires non n'oubliez jamais
Qu'un beau jour nous avions fait ensemble une promesse
S'il n'en reste qu'un nous seront ce dernier

On était plein d'ardeur
Et on sortait vainqueur de nos pauvres blessures
Quand les cœurs étaient lourds
On se trouvait toujours une voix qui nous rassure
On avait tant d'envies
Qu'on voyait notre vie comme une belle aventure
On n'avait pas de maître
La seule à nous soumettre c'était la mère nature

Même au fin fond du désert
On aidait les plus faibles et quitte à y rester
Même au milieu des chimères
On y croyait plus fort quand le courage manquait

Pour vous mes compagnons mes amis de jeunesse
Quelques soient vos histoires non n'oubliez jamais
Qu'un beau jour nous avions fait ensemble une promesse
S'il n'en reste qu'un nous seront ce dernier

Même au milieu des chimères
On y croyait plus fort quand le courage manquait

Pour vous mes compagnons mes amis de jeunesse
Quelque soit mon histoire non je n'oublie jamais
Et aujourd'hui encore je refais la promesse
S'il n'en reste qu'un nous seront ce dernier

Quelques soient vos histoires, ne m'oubliez jamais
Et si un jour je tombe faites moi cette promesse
S'il n'en reste qu'un vous serez ce dernier

Grégoire,"On n'a pas le même drapeau,
Ni la même couleur de peau,
On n'a pas le même langage,
La même culture, les mêmes images.

On n'a pas les mêmes racines,
Les mêmes idoles qui nous fascinent,
Mais chacun de nous est vivant,
Avec la même couleur de sang

Et on a tous le même soleil,
Et la même lune sur nos sommeils,
Et on a tous une main à tendre,
Peut-on encore vraiment attendre?

On n'a pas les mêmes coutumes,
D'autres rites, d'autres costumes,
On n'a pas les mêmes histoires,
Mais nos mélanges fait l'histoire.

On n'a pas les mêmes parents,
Mais on est tous encore enfant,
Et tous issus d'un métissage,
Devenus fous mais nés si sages.

Et on a tous le même soleil,
Et la même lune sur nos sommeils,
Et on a tous une main à tendre,
Peut-on encore vraiment attendre?

Car on a tous la même planète,
Qui nous supplie d'être moins bêtes,
Et on a tous une main à tendre,
Peut-on encore, vraiment attendre?

Une main avec nos différences,
Et le pouvoir d'en faire une chance.

Car on a tous le même soleil,
Et la même lune sur nos sommeils,
Et on a tous une main à tendre,
Peut-on encore vraiment attendre?

Sur toi que tous ces malheureux

Et tu me manques
Oui tu me manques,

Et tu me manques,
Oui tu me manques,

A chaque matin seul dans la glace
Je sens ton absence comme une ombre
Et plus les minutes se cassent
Et plus je plonge dans ta pénombre.

Aux moindres peurs à chaque atchoum
Je ne cherche qu'à te retrouver

À chaque fois que tu l'appelais.

Et tu me manques
Oui tu me manques,

On est de la même terre mais pas du même monde.
Quel enfer de se taire,
Mais comment se parler ne serait-ce qu'une seconde,
Rien ne sert,
Des préjugés, des codes, des barrières.

Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un concours de circonstances,
Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un doute, une coïncidence.
J'ai le corps qui t'appelle et le cœur qui te pense,
Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,
Donne moi une chance.

On s'évite, ça excite,
Bien sûr l'indifférence attise les envies,
Tes regards qui s'égarent,
On a beau le vouloir, l'autre nous l'interdit,
Et l'on part,
Mais dis moi où peut-on se revoir.

Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un concours de circonstances,
Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un doute, une coïncidence.
J'ai le corps qui t'appelle et le cœur qui te pense,
Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,
Donne moi une chance.

Laisser aller nos êtres,
Apprendre à se connaître, un jour, un soir,
Et si nos âmes s'attirent,
Ne plus rien s'interdire
Et puis voir, ce qu'on peut devenir.

Comment faire, pour te plaire.
On est de la même terre mais pas du même monde.
Quel enfer de se taire,

Allume-moi ton phare et mène-moi au hasard vers un monde meilleur
J'ai besoin de ta barque, de tes cordes à mon arc pour combattre ma peur

Aller viens, viens avec moi
Quoiqu'ils disent, on s'en fout
Aller viens, viens avec moi
Comme ils disent, on est fou
Même le plus beau des chemins
N'est pas aussi beau sans quelqu'un
Alors viens, allez viens, allez viens

Allez viens, allez viens, viens avec moi, viens avec moi
Quoi qu'ils disent, on s'en fout
Allez viens, allez viens, viens avec moi, tout près de moi
Comme ils disent, on est fou

Allez viens, allez viens, viens avec moi

Allez viens, allez viens, viens avec moi, tout près de moi

Grégoire,"La Cigale, ayant chanté
Tout l'été,
Se trouva fort dépourvue
Quand la bise fut venue
Pas un seul petit morceau
De mouche ou de vermisseau.
Elle alla crier famine
Chez la Fourmi sa voisine,
La priant de lui prêter
Quelque grain pour subsister
Jusqu'à la saison nouvelle.

""Je vous paierai, lui dit-elle,
Avant l'Oût, foi d'animal,
Intérêt et principal.""

La Fourmi n'est pas prêteuse
C'est là son moindre défaut.
""Que faisiez-vous au temps chaud?""
Dit-elle à cette emprunteuse.

""Nuit et jour à tout venant
Je chantais, ne vous déplaise.""

""Vous chantiez, j'en suis fort aise.
Eh bien, dansez maintenant.""",La  cigale et la fourmi
Grégoire,"Maître Corbeau, sur un arbre perché,
Tenait en son bec un fromage.
Maître Renard, par l’odeur alléché,
Lui tint à peu près ce langage
""Hé, bonjour, Monsieur du Corbeau.
Que vous êtes joli, que vous me semblez beau!
Sans mentir, si votre ramage
Se rapporte à votre plumage,
Vous êtes le Phénix des hôtes de ces bois.""

A ces mots le Corbeau ne se sent pas de joie
Et pour montrer sa belle voix,
Il ouvre un large bec, laisse tomber sa proie.
Le Renard s’en saisit, et dit ""Mon bon Monsieur,
Apprenez que tout flatteur
Vit aux dépens de celui qui l’écoute
Cette leçon vaut bien un fromage, sans doute.""

Le Corbeau, honteux et confus,
Jura, mais un peu tard, qu’on ne l’y prendrait plus.",Le  corbeau et le renard
Grégoire,"Une Grenouille vit un Bœuf
Qui lui sembla de belle taille
Elle, qui n’était pas grosse en tout comme un œuf
Envieuse, s’étend, et s’enfle, et se travaille
Pour égaler l’animal en grosseur

Disant ""Regardez bien, ma sœur
Est-ce assez, dites-moi, n’y suis-je point encore?
Nenni
M’y voici donc?
Point du tout
M’y voilà?
Vous n’en approchez point""

La chétive pécore
S’enfla si bien qu’elle creva

Tout petit prince a des ambassadeurs
Tout marquis veut avoir des pages",La  grenouille qui veut se faire aussi grosse que le boeuf
Grégoire,"Travaillez, prenez de la peine
C’est le fonds qui manque le moins

Un riche Laboureur, sentant sa mort prochaine
Fit venir ses enfants, leur parla sans témoins
Gardez-vous, leur dit-il, de vendre l’héritage
Que nous ont laissé nos parents
Un trésor est caché dedans

Je ne sais pas l’endroit, mais un peu de courage
Vous le fera trouver, vous en viendrez à bout
Remuez votre champ dès qu’on aura fait l’Oût
Creusez, fouiller, bêchez, ne laissez nulle place
Où la main ne passe et repasse

Le père mort, les fils vous retournent le champ
Deçà, delà, partout, si bien qu’au bout de l’an
Il en rapporta davantage
D’argent, point de caché
Mais le père fut sage
De leur montrer avant sa mort
Que le travail est un trésor",Le  laboureur et ses enfants
Gregor Hilden,"You went away and left me long time ago
And now you're knockin' on my door
 
I hear you knocking but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I begged you not to go, but you said goodbye
And now you tell me all your lies
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
 
You better get back to your use to be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me
 
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I told you way back in Fifty Two 
That I would never go with you
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been

Gregor Hubner Quartet,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings
Gregor Meyle,"Wie lang kannst du schwimmen, 
Ohne unter zu gehen? 
Wie weit kannst du laufen, 
Ohne dich nochmal umzudrehen? 
Wie lang kannst du halten, 
Was du dir selber versprichst? 
Wie weit kannst du gleiten, 
Bis das Eis unter dir völlig bricht?

Es ist komisch, was du vermisst. 
Es ist komisch, dass es so ist. 
Du hast alles, was man so braucht, 
Und du bist stolz auf dich.

Doch du bist allein. 
Du fühlst dich allein.

Wie sich dein Schicksal verhält.

Erwischt mich zu Recht 
Hab so lange schon davon geträumt, 
Ich bau mir mein Haus 
Nicht mehr auf Sand und Geröll, 
Kein Orkan der Welt weht es mir fort 
Ich weiß noch genau als die Stunde des Lichts 
Mir im Keller erschien, 
Ich glaubte nicht mehr an Zeichen und Wunder 
Ich wollte vor allem nur flieh´n.

Es ist Zeit, es ist Zeit für mich 
Es ist Zeit, jetzt ist Zeit für mich

Gedanken betäubten zu lang mein Gefühl, 
Meine Sehnsucht war auf Eis gelegt, 
In letzter Sekunde hab ich mich gewehrt 
Hab der Matrix mein eignen Krieg erklärt. 
Ich wollte nicht mehr mich selbst betrügen, 
Mein Schicksal war fast schon verkauft, 
Ich wollte nicht mehr mich selbst belügen, 
Hab mich zusammen gerauft.

Der Bumerang kommt nicht zurück zu Dir
Flieg jetzt los, bis hintern’ Horizont
Es gibt nichts, was Dich am Boden hält bei mir
In Deinen Augen, seh ich das was mir wohl fehlt
Kaum zu glauben, wie der Wind sich für Dich dreht
Ich glaube fest, dass Du´s alleine schaffst
Du hast hart trainiert und viel riskiert für Dich

Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Flieg bitte los, hier wartet keiner

Auch wenn uns das tief verletzt
Kann ich nichts mehr für uns tun
Nur bis hier in geht der Weg,
Der uns beiden offen steht

Und hinter Dir, da wartet keiner

Dass du verpennt hast, 
Die Sonne zu sehen, 
Um zu verstehen,

In deinem Kosmos bleibst du stehn. 
Verschwendest die Zeit, 
Die vorbei geht und du nichts erreicht hast.

Im dunkeln des Nichts.

Hätte nie gedacht das du mich willst, den Retter ohne schwert, 
Ohne Königreich, ohne Krone, mein Leben läuft verkehrt, 
Habe bloß versucht dir zu helfen und hoffte das Schicksal, 
Wird gut für uns sein.

Ich lass dich nich zurück ganz alleine, 
Ich werd immer das Licht für dich schein, 
Und glaube mir jetzt nur das Eine 
Mein Herz ist rein.

Ich bin so froh bei dir zu sein. 
Ich bin so froh mit dir zu sein.

Ist es wirklich wahr das du hier bist, in meiner kleinen Welt, 
Es ist sonderbar das es wir sind, und das es dir gefällt, 
Das du um mich kämpfst und zu mir hälst, egal was passieren wird, 
Wir haben uns Zwei.

Ich lass dich nich zurück ganz alleine, 
Ich werd immer das Licht für dich schein, 
Und glaube mir jetzt nur das Eine, 
Mein Herz ist rein.",Kleines Lied
