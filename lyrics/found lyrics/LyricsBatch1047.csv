Mos Def,"Bismillah ir Rhman ir Raheem

What it is, what it is, what it is
What it is
What it is, what it is, what it is
What it is
See me, want me, give me, trust me
Feed me, fuck me, love me, touch me
This whole world is cold and ugly
What we are is low and lovely
I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your favorite nightmare
Close your eyes and I'll be right there
While, open, all, over, again
See me, touch me, give me, want me
Feed me, fuck me, trust me, love me
This whole world is cold and ugly
What we are is low and lovely
I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your favorite nightmare
Close your eyes and I'll be right there
While, open, all, over, again, again

Mos Def,"Bismillah ir Rhman ir Raheem
Peace, peace whats up y'all this is Mos Def
And this is a message to the people
If you see or hear goodness from me
Then that goodness is from The Creator
You should be thankful to The Creator for all of that
'Cause I'm not the architect of that
I'm only the, the recipient
If you see weakness or shortcoming in me
It's from my own weakness or shortcoming
And I ask The Creator and the people to forgive me for that
Thank you Brooklyn, Thank you World
Yeah, yeah there it is
Turn my voice up in the top a little bit
It feel good to be back
Whats up ochenta?
Yeah, yeah, ha..
It's the Black Dante in your headphones
Speakerbox (freaky radio) freaky radio
(Everywhere on the dial) tell you a little bit about me
For my hometown, break down a little history for you
Myrtle and Broadway, Roosevelt projects, Mossie projects
Listen

I stepped on the field from no league just home team
I Jumped out the stands and I snatched the rock
With the final seconds +one to land+ on the clock
Mos post up to throw up the tie-breakin shot
I put it through the net and let the world's jaw drop
Then fled the arena before they called cops
Tell the players and the coach I wasn't trying to blow spot
But the way they was ballin' made it difficult to watch
I was taught when there's somethin' you can change around
Keep quiet, you got nothin' to complain about
You got work to do, I don't know if that work for you
But that's how Mos work it through
And my work is personal, I'm a working person
I put in work, I work with purpose
I get it there, on the water, air, the surface
You feel the impact? Niggas yeah it's working
Listen God did not make me a fearful person
The only fear I have, Is my failure to ad hear his path
I would love it just to hear this back
On the ghetto streets where y'all at
On the ave's where the Jeep's go past
In the coupes where the seats go back
In the parties where it be so packed
And the atmosphere be so black
And them black things be so phat
If I could I would be so glad
But if not I won't be so mad
I'm still being a man, still feeding my fam'
And even if you don't see it my fam
I believe that I am, truly gifted, truly blessed
I'm yours truly, Brooklyn's own, Mos Def
I'm rocking the hard right, ground zero, to far left
I'm, well balanced, with immense talents
Burn the script, then flip it to keep myself challenged
And that's the mark of a true champ-ine
That's whether I'm in or outside the ring
No fights, no tilte, no crown or reign
Feel my presence even when I'm up out this thing
Just trust, that's what I'm about to be
But until then settle in and rock with me

Ha, that's what its about to be
Ghetto people look alive with me
And say, We 'goin, stop by
Then we just keep moving on
Ghetto people, look alive and
Feel free, we just keep moving on
For Alliah, Left Eye, Jam Master Jay
All the great hero's who have passed away
Scott Laraque, Big & Pac, Feaky Tai, Big L
All the soldiers locked down in the cell
Lock up the flesh, but the spirit will prevail
To our loved ones, and deceased
Dyin in the street, or quiet in their sleep (B.I.G.)
Rest in peace, your living in the mansions of our memory(+Sans Marie+)
Rest in peace, your living in the mansions of our memory
And that's real
Cause everything in life 'gon come to an end
Because it must, and when it does
I hope that y'all remember me
With true respect
And ghetto love
Now raise it up
Cause everything in life 'gon come to an end
Because it must, and when it does
I hope that y'all remember me
Black Dante, from Myrtle and Broadway
Yeah, yeah y'all
Let me hear it back(echo)

Mos Def,"Pull up to your spot on low
Shine brighter than all of they cats that got on glow
Lay in the cut like they not gon' know
Cause if I gotta make a move dog they not gon' know
This door marked private this is not fo' show
It's Mos Def what you call real fo' sure
Is they what you call gangster, hell no
They get a little pinch and go snitch to the po'
They all talk fast and they all think slow
I'm Mos Definite, not think so
Flood your city with the black ink flow
And my crew ain't scared to let them things go
So, stop with the nonsense, like he conscious
I'm just awake dog, I'm doing great dog
I don't play games so I don't playa hate y'all
Get it straight or get the fuck up out my face dog
I'm like the second plane that made the tower's face off
That shit that let you know it's really not a game dog
Your grind and my grind ain't the same dog
I'm the catalogue, you the same song
So cool and old school like eight-four
The one your little mami winding up her waist for
The name that real niggas got they hand raised for
Me and Mini got your block yellow taped off

Don't push me cause I'm close
To the streets, to the beats
The bitches, the niggas, the women, the children
The workers, the killers, the addicts, the dealers
The quiet, the livest, the realest
And that's close

Don't push me cause I'm close
To the edge, back, middle, and front
Strong back shit lifting it up
From the big and the small
I'm like J. Brown getting involved

And when I'm letting off a round don't get in the cross
Have your preacher man speaking low getting his cross
Tell a wild cowboy not to get off they horse
Before they find out the town law is strictly enforced
It's a real bad way to get your name in the Source
Testing the limits of a dangerous force
You ended up dumb, famous and gone
Your people shouting out your name in they song
Pouring liquor on the day you was born
Buying paint to put your face on a wall
C'mon fall back, there's no need for all that
It's all good, we all here, going all out
All live, all day, listen when the song say

Don't push me cause I'm close
To the streets, to the beats
The bitches, the niggas, the women, the children
The workers, the killers, the addicts, the dealers
The quiet, the livest, the realest
And that's close

Don't push me cause I'm close
To the edge, back, middle, and front
Strong back shit lifting it up
From the big and the small
I'm like J. Brown getting involved",Close Edge

Black Jack Johnson NYC, R-O-C-K-I-N-G
Sun and the moon, earths, stars, and planets
Before song done y'all goin' all understand it

Like, hot
The haters can't fuck with it
Cause they mom and they sister and girl in love with
It (and they niggas)
Sound man holla black come with it
Sping the record 'till the record done spinning
Up top is you getting up with it?
Dirty dirty is you getting crunk with it?
Smokey smoke from coast to coast
Be careful our first draw be that overdose
Who stay holding it from brooklyn? you know is mos!
Ha, jackpot I (sing yo) got to go for broke
Is this the only way the smith family now to go
Right here to my youngest one is older folks
I'ma put down like a dirty so and so
Freak daddy came here to work the mojo, oh
Because the, high is high and the low is low
And that goes for the sinner man to holy folks
Put your shit in the sky like I know you, oh
(Brooklyn stand up!)
Ha, my ghetto nation get toe to toe
Stay rocking steady steady 'cause I told you so
And after y'all get it go I let it go some more
That black jack about something for sure) for sure

Let me see you in the world making your shoulder role
And if it get good tell your nigga throw your 'bows

'Cause we are so ghetto
Yes we are rock and roll
Yes we are so ghetto
Yes we are rock and roll
Yes we are so ghetto
Yes we are rock and roll
Yes we are so ghetto
Yes we are, rock and motherfucking roll

Ha, I am a fighter and a lover
I'm the freaky baby daddy, I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm the earth, wind, fire, and the thunder
I said I am, go ask my mother
You don't believe that shit believe what you want to
Alright, ok, so, shut-up!
Speak language come straight from the gutter
Observe the terms that we trade with one and other
Like, what's good, what's popping, what's cracking
What it is, how you living, what's happening
Work songs that the slaves sang back then
The playground chants, with little girls clapping

Blackjack Johnson NYC, R-O-C-K-I-N-G
Son and the moon, earths, stars, and planets
Before the song done y'all going all understand it

Welcome to soundview projects
Bronx new york, 10473

Intersection action ribs touching
New gutter smacks replacing the whole dutchman
Loose mamis fucking, they definite land mines
Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs
Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid
Fighting federal cases with legal aids
The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat
Can get you in a 8 by 5, the corner's younger
I smell feel touch and taste they hunger
Next in line to rep these street signs to they blunder
Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
These niggas wanna be pistol pete -without the penalty
His last words, promise me this much in death
Don't my boy live to retrace my steps

Minne stay safe move quiet and get it
If you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with it

Later amigo, digest the day to end discreetly
Sex money and boss
My ties to hear me see me
True villain
Face covered, driving gloves
Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
They say that grown men lay on they prey
Took shorts in the street
Came back and made up for that with that white sheet
Revenge is best served cold
Get it the same way you give it
This ain't fear I just need to get away with it
Son stop over here(?), you looking at me like I'm lame
But I'm looking at y'all like y'all call this the drug game
Grand child hosing sims
Put the heroin in queens
Put pops freeman on in the early seventies
I sat in rooms with money machines
Drugs sitting 3 feet off of the floor
Cover the smell of the raw
Chess moves like barksdale, my connects untimely
King henry from 12th street flooded the bronx in the 90's
03 scene mvp and one accord
Boss makes decision paper wins awards

See me, hear me

Welcome to brooklyn, new york city 11206
Roosevelt projects, wild rose water the plant

Son you know what it is
From the moment that you come over the bridge
And if you don't ride with me
I'm gonna show you some shit
I'ma show you where my niggas stay sure on the mix
I'ma show you where the pain and the poetry is
Ghetto young'ns spend a lot of time alone in the crib
Bet on the screen, walls and posters of big
Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6
Blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist
Hop in the game knowing the risk
Still down to load up they clip
Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
But when you hear head crack there ain't no rolling again
Snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in
This how it happens, good people, bad habits, diabetics, crack addicts
Asthmatics
Searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet
The bible, the q uran, or the ten crack commandments
Speak on it god, what's today's mathematics
The five day forecast, the dow jones average
The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers
Life is a test and we all got the answer
The streets keep calling its hard not answer
And on my government-my attribute-my all
So it's only natural I holla black and respond
Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down
We do not fuck around

That's what it is (all day)
That's what is niggas (official, official)
That's how it is niggas

They be needing shit, I got ex-wife beef and shit
That's how deep it get
My whole life is real, my whole life is ill
A fantastic, a beautiful mess
And life nigga in America, the usual stress
I do it to the up, low, the east and the west, I
Do it to most, I do it to death

Well do this, move!

Reach the world but touch the street first
Life going in every direction but rewind
Niggas is waiting for the light to dive down
On a park a hustler plays the hide out
Somebody's gotta notice it's a matter of time before the world fine out
The earth dry out and push the hinting to high ground,life style--hostile
Real, life real real
So real, too real, news real--edited
The close up block out the rest of it

And is lovely, and is ugly, as it must be

A brand new excuse does me no use
That won't make it
She at home with the kids, this is no way to live
What can I say?
I know it's surreal, but I'm a hard-headed still
Do things my way

And it's so strong, so strong
It's like I'm dying
Trying to hold on
My body says oh-no, oh, out there
Flying, the price that I pay for the game that I play
Ain't no game at all
I'm up in the clouds, and I'm spiraling down
Nothing breaks the fall

And it's so strong, so strong

But, son, I don't see no brother hood
All I see is thugger hood
Get rich and fuck the hood
All they want is some good smoke from the hood
Lookin' for the shorty good stroke from the hood
That's how they touch the hood
But when I touch the hood, I'll make it brighter, black
Because I'm brighter, black
And I'm so black I'm bright, shine through the blackest night
Shine when I'm live, shine via satellite
Shout in the hood, 'we get the picture.'
'Cause every time you out in the hood, you got photographers wit' ya
What's going on? Ha!

It keep going on, this how it goes on

Get involved, remain to breathe
Ha! Woo!

If Marvin was alive now, wow
What would I say to him?
Where could I start?
How could I explain to him?
I know the minor world would probably look strange to him
Would he feel like today had a place for him?
Global imprisonment, sickness, indifference
When he said, 'Save the babies,' was we listenin'?
When he said, 'Mercy, mercy,' did he really know
That decades later we'd still be killin' folks?
Or did he hope that we would realize
That we the first, the son of Earth
The moon and stars, the great beyond
We black and proud, we brave and strong
We raise it up, we quiet storm, forever fresh
And keepin' on

Yeah yeah its a brand new day y'all (Let the sunshine in)
Turn me up in the top a little bit dog
Little do you know, y'all gonna hear this one (The suns shinin')
Loud and clear, bright and early
Listen

I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock, way above the game
To be point blank with you motherfuck the game
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dog, Not to def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not to dude
I'm grown man business, and I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin' this is not for you
On my ""J.O."" with beats by Kan-ye yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh, like I'm still a day old
And it's been like that since the day yo
On more time than a Roley, or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low

(Let the sun shine)
Standing in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn nigga I am, Black Dante (Let the sunshine in)
That nigga, that dude
Black People, Lets Move (The suns shinin')
Shout out to my man Talib Kweli, yes
We on top-a top-a, shout-a shout-a
Check it out

Slim nigga that casts a big shadow
Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow
Got more skill, more aim, and more ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, hail Mary, full of grace
Niggas come in and shoot up the place
And make you pull up your face
The deck, I'm a pull out the ace
From the jungles of the empire state
where it ain't no escape, 247, 718
And that's like every night, every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the states, I'm collecting my pay
Blast off then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro ball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised

(Let the sun shine)
Like a long time man of the way
You understanding me straight (Let the sunshine in)
Yes, yes, no doubt, excellence
Its what it is, what it is
And that's what it is, you see? (The suns shinin')
Ha, Fire

'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God, and involve with niggas
These elements I perform my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn it don't matter if you holler or whisper
Your coming through clan, 'cause I'm right here with ya
Ain't gotta edit the slang, I got it, I'll get ya
Yo, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers
The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggas
Rebel guerrillas the ghetto civilians
y'all 'goin feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra, ordinary and plain
I walk a thousand paces of light ahead of the game
By the time you get where I'm standing, I'll be gone
y'all make moves, but y'all just move on

(Let the sun shine)
I move in, and y'all must move on
'Cause I move to strong
And I know what my feet move for (Let the sunshine in)
Made it go without a brand new car
Made it fresh without a brand new song
And give a fuck about what brand you are (The suns shining')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles and standards are
You understand me y'all
Be good to your family y'all
No matter where your families are
'Cause everybody needs family y'all
Raise a hand, you understand me y'all
Everybody needs family y'all
Be good to your families dog
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody needs family dog
Raise a hand, you understand me pa

Mos Def,"War is a global economic phenomenon

Ain't a batch of guns on where, hellfire
Spittin', run up everything they hittin'
Some do they job to dodge the barrage
As sleek projectiles never stay bound
Fire bite invades the night with light
Loud, fighter planes shout shell rain
When they shot to kill cops on the terrain
And leave any brain that may remain stained
You god damn right this war goin' too far
Socialists think they converse with the stars
Wars found, my find the beauty in the stars
I level with death even beneath radar
I level with death even beneath radar
I level with death and she got pretty eyes
Nobody told me death was so damn fine
I go to sleep with that girl on my mind
Wake up in a sea, I want to fire in line
Grab my heat, then it's get down time
One day I'ma make that girl all mine
But for now I'm a soldier abidin' my time
Writin' my rhyme behind enemy lines
Palestine, Kosovo, Cashmere
No different than the avenues right here
An increase in the murder rate each year
Paramilitary unit keep the streets clear
Curtains up on the theater of warfare
Dramatic politics nightly preformed here
Worldwide from Colombia to Columbine
Don holders keep ya dollar signs on the line

""I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if possible
Jew, gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another
Human beings are like that
We want to live by each other's happiness
Not by each other's misery
In this world, there's room for everyone
And the good earth is rich
And can provide for everyone a way of life""

Fuck that

You know the drill
Fix ya face
I'ma hustle off the hill
Go get my money man
Go get my money man

See every hunter need to kill
Go get my money man

I'm old school from off the hill
Go get my money man

Go get my money man
I give a fuck what I do
Go get my money man
Go get my money man
Go get that money man

Mos Def,"Yo I'm live with it, low, middle, the high with it
And that's how I'ma live and die with it
Hold up and down your spine with it
Like Zimzallabim, Jack Johnson, yes my dog, right with them!
The most special, most ghetto, most method, most valuable
Rep my avenue like is the damn state capital
Coming shadows to mind, a better mark of rap-ness
On slaves who high jacked the slave ships
The hackers who remapped the matrix
And built the road back to basics
And get ya all off that strain shit
You know this other cats run game with, it's tainted
Consider this the moment that changed it, now!
Jack john's stand strong never bow down
Back off or get clapped dog right about pow
For east to the west,up north to down south
We show you how to really make mosh pit bounce
Show you how the gritty make the ghetto wild out
First letters that I wrote when I sketch the script down
I'm live with it
Low, middle, the high with it
And that's how I'ma live and die with it
I shine with it, rhyme with it, reveal and recognize with it
The ghetto know what time is it, when I spit it
Me 9-semi, an iron lion strike with it
See Dr. Know string a knot and make 'em ride with it

And look alive
Ghetto rock with me
Look alive
Ghetto rock with me
Aha yeah
Throw it up
Ghetto rock with me
Show it up
Ghetto rock with me

Born to rock, since my pawn shift rise ?
Rock the booze water on any bully on your block
My flow tighter than a big titties halter top
Doper than a Floyd flake that they bought they pops
Since I bright a con duke of course I'm not
My sharp mind join the dots and blow they plots
A lot of cats talk noise a lot, but then the noise is stopped
When the heavy sound voice in charge
And this is no Limp Bizkit this is jack's fat cock
Loaded up slightly back, ghetto black rock
Brooklyn got bomb-rush that you can't stop
These the hungry hands that goin' snatch your cash box
I never gave a second what on ""the fuck is with y'all?""
Cause my first thought covered it all
You whack!
And I don't care what you sound since not mumbling y'all
Cause you can't do me nothing at all
Which means, you can't shine my shoes watch my drawers
Clean my cloth walk my dog moan my loan
On other words dude I don't need shit from them
All I got is hard rhymes and hot spit for them
And yeah, I got the country new (rat) for them
See how dark it can get for them?
Tell their mommas THAT'S IT for them
Get the flowers, they'll sing for them
A sad story how it'll end for them
That's what you get for not listenin' fire!
And a long rest in kumbayah
You stand strong you can't move higher
You move in ""how we all can move higher?""
Ready to roll like new tire
Well I can show you who the true lion
True power move quiet through the understanding of the science

We live with it, no middle, the high with it
And that's how we goin' live and die with it
Now ride with it

Little face, soft lips, little waist (Break it more)

They come through, and they, I guess trying to recover people
And they see this women she's wading through the streets
I guess it'd been some time after the storm
And I guess they were shocked that you know she was alive
And rescue worker said, ""So, oh my God h-how did you survive
How did you do it? Where've you been?""

Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a youngin, before the days of thugging
How me and Charlie Chims (hey yo what?) I'm only bugging
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Living the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sitting roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doing all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cause we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp! ) we bust back
Bring the Marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Trying to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go

Good morning Vietnam!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up) [repeated in background]
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the Jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbing it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shout out ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representing it
Sitting on they front stoop sipping Guinesses
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenements
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From sun to the? to the Lafayette Gardens
White coff guawinas in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya going wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my yarda trenny  Brown's Village
Parkside tennants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City getting busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playing loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown strongly!
Raise it up!

Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jame is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustling you can't relax
The crack babies trying to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stomping grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazing charm that have your wave cap floating back
The doorstep where the dispossessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave selling zovarax
You big balling better keep your money folded back
Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on taking it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat",A  Ha

The plains and the valley

Eh eh eh eh lifetime, lifetime
Keep keeping on
Maintain the rock, keep up the rock

The lights in the plaza meant there's something fantastic
The moment I met you, the first look was like magic
Yeah, there's the way that it is and the way that it feels
There's the distance between the ideal and the bills

The heat from the brights
The temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath

The aroma of sesamilia dollar superstar
Skama like a new cocaine tobacco leaf
Ecstatic tabernists fire water and freaks
The murder of a teenage chief

Hungry belly jamma busts off easily

Remember!
Anyways they laid him in a stray box
Dark suit and gray socks
The neighborhood is all distraught
Candles lit the stoop at the park
Where the family and students are
Confused, in awe
They gape into each others arms
It's murder!
New absence from a mothers arm
Even the warmth from the mother's arms

From standing where the gun was drawn

Murder!
Shells fell like a bell that rung
Blood bursts, body temperature fell and plunged
And by the time it took the medics to come
The breath eased out of his lungs
And his soul eased out of the slums
And the voice eased out of the drums
The sirens through their ears, they sung
Murder!
Telephone wire, sneakers hung
Murder!

Murder!

I am from the block the president did not campaign on
Where the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on
Where hustlers stretch the yay long
And hustle hard for an outpost to trade on
Flip it over and make more
Where the blocks are yellow taped off
Where the young blood is trained on obese to the fakesoft
Where the pressure just stays on
But the lights and the heat don't
The place where you witness the true power of street folk
And that's where I'm coming from people

The mathematic to acting still
The unfamiliar the warm embrace
The family ties and the stranger's face
The lighting thunder the power steed
The what it is and the what is believed
The strong connections desire to need
The waking now or the moment to dream
The laugh the murmur the moan and the scream
The voice of reason somewhere in between
The one and all the me and the we
The I and I the thou and the thee

The daily chore the impossible feat

You ever felt like the realest nigga alive?
Felt too pretty or powerful to die?
Tell the truth,
You ever felt ugly enough to cry?
Have you ever begged for mercy?
Have you ever wished you died?
Tell the truth
Have you ever taken pride in the crime?
Been too hungry to break down or hide?
Felt low down dirty? Or super duper high?
Or contemplated murder, robbery, or suicide?
Tell the truth
Taken medicine for trouble in your mind?
Or taken down a number? For taking up a scheme?
I made her wild, beautiful take her 'til she skeet?
Take her to the penthouse or take her to the skreet?

They might be doing things that you wanna' do
You fantasize as they be living it through
The big home with the beautiful view
You have a swim in the pool, and get fresh
And take a spin in the coupe
Tell the truth
You probably want to feel the world in your palm
While hold a gun in your hand
And make 'em know you a star
Tell the truth
And there's those who probably already are
They well known in they zone
Or they town or they block

Then there's the rest who are usually not
And the heavy dose of thug feel like all that they got

Other brothers just don't know
You got to feel me on this one man
So real
I'm so sin-serious about it, you know?
I know, I know more than a few is gonna relate
So much more than a few (fa-really real)
So much more (on the really real!)

When it started I knew it was trouble
But you know me
Them ""hard an' everything's"" can't hold me (you love, hard head)
I need some shit straight out the movies

Warm to the touch, hot mama
You put me all in like launch jeans and scama
You was Mrs. Mine
So fine
Went from ""we gonna conquer it all""
To ""nigga I'ma see you in court""
I would of never thought (damn)
I guess I better think again (you know?)
OK, now the shit is really sinking in
We ain't just divorced
We ain't even fucking friends
Cause in the end it was all about the ends

But fuck that I know it gotta be more to it
Held up with bitter hate with crosses all through it
And when I looked, what did I see?
You on the other end crying like me
Expression on your face like, ""how could this be?""
That's what I'm asking, ""what the fuck happened?""
How could all the magic and passion just vanish (come on)
Went from outstanding, to makin' me shout, ""Dammit!""
Can't explain the changes, behavior's is outlandish
Now I'm just stuck in the road feeling stranded
I'm in the dark wishing for the answers
On some ol' ""Biggie gimme one more chance"" shit

When we met your face so brown
Ya ass so round, of course I'm so down
Wish I knew then what the fuck I know now
Couldn't read the signs in the road: ""SLOW DOWN!""
I'm too deep in the road now
Got me pulling over getting smoked out
Fighting tears that I can't hold down
Can't believe it, this fucker's got me weeping
I keep it a secret so my friends won't peep it (live man?)
But late in the evening I'm up, my chest heaving
I'm reaching in the dark and I'm looking for the reason
Why!
Did our love have to die?
You and I were so fucking fly
Can't get it off my mind
The things that made me smile now make me cry

You are the one
You're the one!
Fuck you!

I wish we never met, I wish we never kissed
I wish we never touched (I swear to God)
I wish I didn't love you so much
I wish I could forget how feel, how you f

Things are so passionate times are so real
Sometimes I try an chill mellow down blowin smoke
Smile on my face but its really no joke
You feel it in the streets people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down they focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes ya don't hear me
I push it past the bass no nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And its volumes or scriptures when I breath on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word

Mind is a vital force, high level right across

I swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous there's no need for fightin'

Again and again, so fresh
Again and again, newness

I was born in the decade of decadence where they worship what they have
Ford was president, do the math
The war was ended when the Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like, bye; we was gone, let bygones be bygones
I'm gone, spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Where the hug you with the firearm, try it on
Like new school clothes, Black Star official
Smash when we do a show, it's facts, no mystery
I'm down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with the Roots like the Giving Tree
Powerful, bigotry at work, me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We get it poppin' like a hit chorus
The flow is historic, they can't get rid of us
Ubiquitous, and we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history so they missing us

And don't call it comeback in particular
We will never blend into ephemera or
Fade into peripheral, transition of the minister's original
We're broadcast clear without diminishing
Black Star so tight, burning soul temperatures and ministers
Alkalines, aminos and minerals essentials
Served over Dilla time signatures
It's miracle material, remember it's right now foreverness",History

Some lies close
Some stretchers role with no lies at all.
Some riders don't know what they riding for

Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone
Wherever you ride, whatever your name,
This raw cold life is a beautiful thing

And we are alive in amazing times
Delicate hearts, diabolical minds

Revelations, hatred, love and war.
And more and more and more and more
And more of less than ever before
It's just too much more for your mind to absorb

Do it count as a fall or a jump?
And do it feel like a fall when the hands that pushed you
Were holding you up?

I used to lie awake and wonder
If there could be
A someone in this wide world

I had to save my love
For you
I never gave my love

And through my lonely heart demanding it

Not for long! I can see the way this ends

I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop

Why stars in the trees hide when it rains

Will it sing you a song  
Will it say a farewell

Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender

Left my bearer to check the market price

And the men were playing cards and dice
So I stepped up to the bar to join them 
What a grand place, this Fool's Paradise

It was then I showed to them your picture 
I passed it around once or twice
Then a man insulted your sweet honor

You send me out of here

Hold me, don't let me fall
'Cause I've a fear being alone
And I feel like its been a long year
I wish for you to take me home

(You)
Send me out, send me out
You send me out of here

Don't let the sun go down on your anger
She would say,
""I know you've been right here all the while""
And I would stay

I'm hoping you're the one
That saw me in the moon
Somebody tell me my name
Before I leave here, soon

I find traces of hope along tears
And all the reckless reasons to hold on
I feel like falling when you rise
'Cause I I know there's no point
No reason to fight

But you send me out
Send me out, send me out
You send me out of here

You send me out
Send me out, send me out
Send me out of here

Mostly Autumn,"Weightlessly you leave the ground
Hanging gently in the breeze,
You lift your head to face the stars
And catch the wind above the trees,
You know you're safe, you know you're there
The night sky rushing through your hair
The shadow cast across the fields
By silver moon that lights the night
Over the mountains over the hills,
The changing horizons, you drift through the valleys
Reaching for distance, floating alone,
Like an eagle at midnight, under the stars.

Through frozen eyes you see the hills
Go rolling by, your spirit fills with wonder
And the freedom to roam the winter sky,
You drift into the fragrance of the forest
Swaying gently down below.

The warm glow of a village sleeping silently,
You rise to meet the bleakness of the mountain
That roll into the distance,
A ghost upon the north wind bound for nowhere,
To meet the rising sun.",The Night Sky

With proud yarn she will spin her golden memories into stories

She looks to the sky
She's holding on to yesterday's goodbyes
Goodbye

She knows what it means to be evergreen
She knows how it feels to have loved and lost
She's seen faces change all around her, then moved on

She'll miss hearing wind through now fallen leaves
She'll stand scraping snow-filled skies alone
Her questions, if could be asked, would be left unanswered

Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul

He converteth me to lamb cutlets,
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones,

Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate,
Lo, we shall rise up,
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

I want to thank you for being a part of my the forget-me-nots and marigolds..
And all the things that don't get old..
Is it legal to do this? I surely don't know.
It's the only way I have learned to express myself around other peoples' descriptions of life..
I'm afraid I'm alone and entirely useless...

Let's get fucked up and die.
For the last time I'm feeling
We'll try not to smile
As we cover our heads and drink heavily into the nights
That's no shocking and surprise.
I believe that I can, overcome this and beat everything in the end
But I choose to abuse for the time being,
Maybe I'll win, but for now I've decided to die.

Sister soldier
You've been such a positive influence on my mental frame
If I could ever repay you,
I would, but I'm hard up for cash
And my memory lacks initiative.

God damn the liquor stores' closed,
We were so close to scoring
It hurts, it destroys til it kills..
I am tired and hungry and totally useless.

there's no escape

but the truth is

there's a line that we all cross

I've been crossed out

we all get crossed out


All the same sad lives

all the love that disappears

we are aching bones

and wasted years


We have few regrets

save it for every night alone

in the sinking ship and haunted home


Out of the blue out into the loneliest place that you'll ever know.

I carried the world just as far as I could but the damage had taken it's tole.


You used to call my name every hour of every day

how I live to hear that sound

but every sound gets washed away

we wash away


We are not as strong

we have almost disappeared

all the love we shared

was destroyed years ago


All the days and nights

days of having lots of lies

as the clockwork creeps on useless lives


Out of the blue out into the loneliest place that you'll ever know.

I carried the world just as far as I could but the damage had taken its tole


You used to call my name every hour of every day

how I live to hear that sound

but every sound gets washed away


And the years have been unkind

we no longer have control

and we used to make a smile

Pursue the sound and lock the door

We are no more


I wrote a letter, a letter to write from the start

I married the madness who left me alone in the dark

wrote down her a letter ""I'll shiver without you tonight""

I did everything right

I did everything I thought was right


I did everything right

I did everything I thought was right

Desire jumps the fence and hightails to the sea
A subtle tale turns into nightmares
Without the sentence structure 
Nothing functions, no one has a clue
If it's me or if it's you
Was it me or was it you?

I'm not asking you to leave
I'm just begging you to let me get some sleep
I've lied awake for far too long
I get so sick and tired of witnessing the dawn

As winter strangles at the shoreline
Division locks the door and confiscates the key
All freezerburn and Arctic research
The time has passed for parting glances,
There's no romance, there's no sign
Of the things that used to be
And all those things you promised me

I'm not asking you to leave
I'm just begging you to let me get some sleep
I've lied awake for far too long
I get so sick and tired of witnessing the dawn

From nervous hands to nervous nightmares
I often wake and find...

We're not alone, just lonely all of the time
We're not alone, just lonely all of the time
We're not alone, just lonely all of the time
We're not alone, just lonely all of the time

I'm not asking you to leave
I'm just begging you to let me get some sleep
I've lied awake for far too long
I get so sick and tired of witnessing the dawn

I'm not asking you to leave 
(I'm not asking you to leave)
I'm not asking you to leave 
(I'm not asking you to leave)
I'm not asking you to leave 
(I'm not asking you to leave)
I'm just begging you to let me get some sleep.
",Not Asking You to Leave
Motion City Soundtrack,"To the deep end, to the heart line
Hold it straight together, man
Hold it straight together, if you can
Little fevers wrapped in medication
All strung out on novelty
Collapse yourself and try to comprehend
An angry island, a bitter bee sting
Severing and shattering
Free the self and fix the in between
It's isolation, mark the earth around you
Guess who's on the waiting list
I'll let you in on something secret

I can disappear
Anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shuffle through my skin
I am with you til the end

First you breathe out
Then you have to breathe in
Lash yourself repeatedly
Until it sticks, until it sticks
Under the eyelids, carry on cadaver
Festering interiors
All hollow breach and vapor silhouette
Need medication, more medication
Coursing through your interstates
All mad and great, confused and counterfeit
Kamikaze, sear the blood inside me
Guess who's got it figured out
I'll let you in on something secret

I can disappear
Anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shuffle through my skin
I am with you til the end

And I can decompose
When it suits me I accelerate it
Wicked on all fours,
I surrender to the storm

You'll never know how it feels
You'll never know how it feels
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I can disappear
Anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shuffle through my skin
I am with you til the end

I can decompose
When it suits me, I accelerate it
Wicked on all fours,

I didn't think it was a bad idea,
I just couldn't figure out how to make the phone work

That said, it was no different from the others,
Except that this is now and that was then and everything
Seems to repeat in a cyclical pattern,
I hum myself to misery and wish these words against my pillow

That tiny, yellow cat- always on vacation
I wish I hadn't been so damn obscure,
I just try too hard for the perfect word score

Can't stand it, end up cursing out the covers,
A little chain and people restless like an effigy
Damn you, camera, lack of emotion,
I'll swing my blades at everyone,
Whack their heads and run for cover

Hysteria, hysteria, it's happening again.
I fall apart, I fall apart, I'm back where I began
If it were anybody else but you, I would not be afraid.

Come help me get it right this time around
If you can figure it out,

Loose leaf, and some liquid fiction
Last rites every Friday night,
Am I weaker with the lights on?

High tide tight around the neck,
The same song everybody's bleeding
What makes me so different?
The insides work the same

You ever fear the dark impressions of your future?
The slightest gravestone whisper?
The stillness of your heart?
I feel it growing dark,
A fever inching deeper,
A fever inching to the core

Fight back at the pouring rain.
I'll send the weak ends down the drain, down the drain
I'll kick tomorrow,
Fight back at the pouring rain
I'll send the weak ends down the drain, down the drain

Shorelines all around the world,
Bright lights and some heavy breathing
Lipstick and the dagger's kiss
Just a figment of a feeling

Hands pressed up against the chest,
Holding out for the big connection
Last lunge never looked so good,
It's a junk show all the way

As years go crashing by,
I think of all I've pondered
So many minutes wandered,
So many things undone
I've tried to figure out
How many lives I've wasted waiting for the perfect time to start

Watch it count down to the end of the day

No revocation for the damned
Cursed temptations ground to sand

Dehumanizing virtue for your novelty
Serenade with a swollen tongue

I am the deep shade of jaded
Will I burn down your fortress of lies?
Six fucking years I have waited
To fucking cut you out of my life

This is my resignation from
All that we’ve loved and left behind
Now I’ll leave it behind

A portrait of torture we paint
Beguiling allure whilst adorned in lace
Eternally the porcelain cracks
A fatal passion forged in black
Like a creature of oddity
A captivating vessel of aesthetic beauty
Dressed in blood to provoke collapse
A fatal heart preserved in wax

I’ve finally let you go and left the past to die
This is my resignation from
All that we’ve loved and left behind
In the grave you dug for me
A frame of bones reside
The flesh has burnt to embers
My muse, this is my last goodbye

Spit you out

I was just a corpse you saw fit to drag around
Now your hold on me’s broken
But heaven knows I’m miserable now
No longer your ashtray

February are her lips so inviting
Silk hair as short as her fuse
She's been damaged, she's been misused

Her eyes reflect like the rain on the pavement
I take control, she explodes, sink into her depths
I'm the tremble in her voice when she attempts to speak
Fixate on the frailty

We lie awake and watch it grow
She hesitates to grab a hold
Her body shakes, her breath is cold
To keep her safe is all I know

Her lipstick stains like acid rain
Dissolving away my sense of restraint
The streetlamps burned through the cloak of the fog
Concealing the violence, I've been stung by the wasp

I'm the rapture in her head when she attempts to sleep

And my head aches but I refuse to go
Her face as soft as snow
She looks so lost but she feels like home

Concealing the violence, I've been stung

The windshield cracks through the cloak of the fog

While evil stood strong 
In the dusts of hell 
Lurked the blackest of hates 
For he whom they feared 
Awaited them...

Lay destroyed beaten beaten down 
Only corpses of rebels

Lights go down, time to turn the page

Faced away from your heart
Those last few nights
It turned and sliced you apart
This love that I tell
Now feels lonely as hell
From this padded prison cell

So many times I said
You'd only be mine
I gave my blood and my tears
And loved you cyanide
When you took my lips
I took your breath
Sometimes love's better off dead

You're all I need make you only mine
I love you so I set you free
I had to take your life
You're all I need, you're all I need
And I loved you but you didn't love me

Laid out cold
Now we're both alone
But killing you helped me keep you home
I guess it was bad
Cause love can be sad
But we finally make the news

Tied up smiling
I thought you were happy
Never opened your eyes
I thought you were napping
I got so much to learn
About love in this world
But we finally made the news

She sticks her poison right in my vein
Spinning around
Over and upside down in love

She breaks my will
She's my bitter pill
Addicted to her
Can't fight off this chill
She blurs my world
She's my bitter pill
We creep the night
Just to taste the thrill
Hopelessly in love

Or catch a freight train
Or a rocket ship into outer space

To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did

Separate paths, separate ways

Let's blame it on the rain

I knew it all along
I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through pain
That's alright, that's okay

Down from L.A.
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

That's alright, that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
That's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, let's turn the page
And remember what I say girl
And it goes this way

Girl, don't go away mad
Girl, just go away
Girl, don't go away mad
Now girl, just go away, (here it go)
Don't go way mad
I don't want you mad
Come on girl
Come on baby

Mötley Crüe,"Alright, alright
This life is what you make it, don't slide
You can't compromise
You click your heels three times your imagination runs wild
You can't analyze

So be sure that you are makin' the best of what, that you have
The truth is all within yourself
Don't be a slave, a slave to someone else

Higher, higher it's where we want to be in our minds
It will mesmerize
It's pleasure power that's what we devour
You can't have it crystallized
Now it's time to look at what you've done, with your life
And that path you found and followed in yourself
I won't be a slave, a slave to someone else
I won't be a slave, a slave to anyone

The question is, when it's all done
Who will stand, and I will run
The answer is on my tongue
I won't be a slave to anyone.

So be sure, that you are makin' the best, makin' the best of life
And that you have the truth, it's within yourself
And don't be a slave, a slave to someone else
No don't be a slave, a slave to someone else",Enslaved

My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same

Without you I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never never know

Without you without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong

Without you without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive

Mötley Crüe,"Tonight, there's gonna be a fight
So if you need a place to go
Got two room slum, a mattress and a gun
And the cops don't never show

So come right in 'cause everybody sins
Welcome to the scene of the crime
You want it? Believe it? We got it if you need it
The devil is a friend of mine

If you think it's crazy, you ain't seen a thing
Just wait until we're going down in flames

We are, we are the saints, we signed our life away
Doesn't matter what you think, we're gonna do it anyway
We are, we are the saints, one day you will confess
And pray to the saints of Los Angeles

Red line tripping on a land mine, sipping at the Troubadour
Girls passed out naked in the back lounge, everybody's gonna score
She's all jacked up, she's down on her luck
You want it, you need it, the devils gonna feed it

Don't you say, it's crazy, you don't know a thing
Just wait until we're going down in flames

We are, we are the saints, we signed our life away
Doesn't matter what you think, we're gonna do it anyway
We are, we are the saints, one day you will confess
And pray to the saints of Los Angeles

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up

Doesn't matter what you think, we're gonna do it anyway

Mötley Crüe,"I met her down at Marilyn's Grave, looking like an S & M slave,
Drinking like a fool with a prison tattoo on her cheek,

Well I knew it would never last, cause we were running from our criminal past, 
But none of that mattered I was hot and she was flattered by me,

Well I had one or two gram lines to get inside her head, 
There's no need for roses I just laid her down in bed.

This ain't a love song, this is a fuck song, don't have to sing along,
This ain't a love song, it's just a fuck song, yeah, um

She didn't wanna look in my eyes, as we bailed down Beverly drive,
Looking for a place to stop, a little place to get high,
Susie didn't call it love, she was good just giving it up,
All she really wanted was a little Rock N Roll that night,

She said ""Turn it up so fuckin' loud, that I can't hear my mind"",
She bent down on the bed post, and I watched Suzie grind!

This ain't a love song, this is a fuck song, don't have to sing along,
This ain't a love song, it's just a fuck song, let's do it all night long, yeah! Wow!

Well I had one or two gram lines to get inside her head,

'Cause when I gotta taste of you
I found somethin' I could sink my teeth into

Its the deepest cut you feel
Its the thing in you that feeds

Its the darker side of lust
Its the other side of us
Its the thing in you that feeds
The animal in me

I wanna be your last breath

A kiss you cant forget
Like a wedding on a rainy day

Down from L.A.
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

You other fuckers saw the writing on the wall

All bad things must end, all bad things must die
Even the devil's gotta pay for his crime
All bad things must end, all bad things must die

Even the angels wanna cry
'Cause all bad things must die

So here we are, beat up and bloodied
We fought each other for the good up to the top
And I said, ""oh man, a little Lee's way
Let's pull the plug on this before he starts to rot""

Execution by a hangman's noose
A thousand ways to die, but you can choose
We're just here for our crucifixion

All bad things must end, all bad things must die
Even the devil's gotta pay for his crime
All bad things must end, all bad things must die

It's been a dam good life, this ain't farewell, it's goodbye

Don't listen to the news

They like to keep your state confused
Propaganda time, the official line

You only hear the man
Don't take them in, you don't know where they been
'Cause it's a complex plan
They keep you nice and quiet, even control your diet
You're hungry, you get fed
Teach you to be meek, till all you are is weak
Till you're just a talking head

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Shake your head you must be dead if it don't make you fly,

The dark sideÂ´s all you want to see
Blackheart, Blackheart
What you want to do,
Blackheart
You know itÂ´s always true
Give back what I get from you,
Blackheart

I know the ones I win, I know the ones I lose
I canÂ´t apologise, I know I paid my dues
I canÂ´t be sorry, if I ainÂ´t always a saint
Like to be a nice guy, but donÂ´t blame me if I ainÂ´t

[Chorus]

So thatÂ´s the story, what you see is what you get,
No doubt thereÂ´s better men than me
But I ainÂ´t met one yet
No doubt the dancer calls the tune,
So you can call on me
IÂ´m all IÂ´Â´ve got, and what I am is what IÂ´ll be

Pay your money, take your choise, everybodyÂ´s free,
I know nobodyÂ´s perfect and if they are it wonÂ´t be me
IÂ´ll be the bad guy in the movie of your life
Just thank your lucky stars I didnÂ´t use a knife

You want to believe
The dark side is all you want to see

To fight for a land fit for heroes,
God on my side, and a gun in my hand,
Chasing my days down to zero,
And I marched and I fought and I bled and I died,
And I never did get any older,
But I knew at the time that a year in the line,
Was a long enough life for a soldier,

We all volunteered, and we wrote down our names,
And we added two years to our ages,
Eager for life and ahead of the game,
Ready for history's pages,
And we brawled and we fought and we whored 'til we stood,
Ten thousand shoulder to shoulder,
A thirst for the Hun, we were food for the gun,
And that's what you are when you're soldiers,

I heard my friend cry, and he sank to his knees,
Coughing blood as he screamed for his mother,
And I fell by his side, and that's how we died,
Clinging like kids to each other,
And I lay in the mud and the guts and the blood,
And I wept as his body grew colder,
And I called for my mother and she never came,
Though it wasn't my fault and I wasn't to blame,

Ended way too soon
Seems like faded echoes

Strangers in the night,
Strangers in the light,

Just makes us scratch and bite,
Thought we had the answers,
we were sure couldn't lose,
What you want from me,
Is all the things that I can't be
Listen to me baby,
I'm beginning to go crazy
Miss me when I'm gone

More I think about it,
It's a goddamn shame,
Opposites attract
'Till they become the same,
Daggers in our eyes,
Time to say goodbye,
Time to stop pretending,
Time to stop the endless lies
I wish you luck, babe
I hope you find a dream and it comes true

Don't you run an' scream

The day has come, the day has come,
We march to Armageddon, hungry for the war
I see the hated enemy, I see what I was taught to see

And one of us will bend the knee
We understand the law

The blood lust jerks our legs to march,
Fife and drum, fife and drum
Our eyes are fixed and fearless
Searching for the war
Our statesmen deal in blood and lies
A hundred million stifled cries, a hundred million wasted lives
Already gone before

So march or die, march or die
The stench of death is in the sky
We never fail to satisfy
We rend with tooth and claw

Sword and shield and jackboot heel
We love to kill, we love to kill
We love to taste our own blood
Squirm in our own gore

Children weep and widows wail,
Our education systems fail,
To hide our guilt we build more jails,
And we shall build still more
Our forests die, the stranglehold
That we put on the earth for gold
Will yet increase ten thousand fold
And no one knows what for

March and die, march and die
Defecate, despoil and lie
Cheat, dissemble, preach & spy
Build your house of straw

Laugh and cry, laugh and cry
Bloody sunset drowns the sky
For earth the heal then we must die
No-one deserves it more

I tell you we are doomed my friends
Our time is come, our time is come
We live within a charnel house
Rotten to the core
We glorify lust, greed & pain
We drown our hope in poison rain
We point the finger, shift the blame
Ambition makes us whores

Fill your days with piss and smoke

Here we are, black and gold, in another time.

Dust, on a mirror turned black,
The refection is flawed, all the mirrors are cracked,
Strange how the glass seems to sing,
But the words are like death, they could be anything,
Here we are, win or draw, badly used, badly scored,
Here we are, gone before, in another time.

Look through the eyes of the mask,
Tell me what do you see, can you make out the facts
Could in the arms of the dead,
I still hear them talk, telling jokes in my head,

The undeserved is paramount,
Unnumbered bones for us to count,

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?

A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Trees are stone where I live, leaves of razor steel,
High and low and ice and snow, broken on the wheel,
Trees are stone where I live, flowers made of glass,
Cold and white and wrong and right and voices from the past.
And all our yesterdays are now undone.
Out of the sun

Frozen and insane, I alone remain,
Held in the vice of my disdain,
There is now way that anyone will ever,
Make me warm again.

Life is death where I live, frozen grin my smile,
Sun is moon and out of tune, broken strings and bile,
Death is life where I live, hearts turned into stone,
Frozen breath, and froze death and prisons made of bone.

Leather and metal and blood,
How could anyone do it.

Over the broken and maimed,
Over the enemy's banners, beaten and trampled and shamed.

Sword and shield, bone and steel, righteous grin
Deaf forever to the battles din

March or croak, flame and smoke, burn forever in eternal pain

Armored fist, severed wrist, broken spears in a sea of mud

You win some, lose some, all the same to me,

Going with the flow, it's all the same to me,

Double up or quit, double stake or split,

And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind

Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard

You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebite kiss

Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circle lose you track

Motörhead,"So this a new beginning, as the new century dawns
The world's a better place for you and me
Shouldn't smoke or drink or watch that evil filthy porn.
Be Christian and God will set you free.
But being poor is worse than having AIDS,
The homeless live in boxes at our feet
Living in a constant state of dull frustrated rage,
The innocent shot daily in the street

[Chorus:]
Brave new world, brave new world, brave new world
[Repeat]

The government has always been you pal as you well know
Absolute corrupted power play,
If we all wipe each other out, it only goes to show
While the bureaucrats get richer by the day,
Smoking dope will get you more than murder one,
And even worse than statutory rape,
Don't understand your children, so you send them all to jail,
Believe me, you will never make a worse mistake.

[Chorus]

The government is coming and it wants to be your friend,
It wants to show you how to be a snitch
Inform upon your children, the inevitable end,
Is everyone's a victim but the filthy fucking rich,
And religion, like the monster that it is
Keeps telling you to turn the other cheek
God is on your side, but I don't think that you're on his,
If Jesus showed up now he'd be in jail by next week,

I wish that I was lying,

The year I ran as a wolf,
Tonight the food is you,

All the tribe ran mad,
On the frozen lake,
And I felt so glad,
With tooth and claw,
All your blood and more,
When I ran with the wolves,
And the hunt turned bad,

Not like the one, I used to be,
See me now, you would not guess,
A different heart raving in my chest,

Stand your ground fight your best
Drop ‘em in their tracks

See the shadows fall

Wir können den Engeln nicht vertrauen und bewegen uns blind
Wir finden unseren Weg, wenn der Wind weht
Ich würde so gerne wissen, wer über mein Leben bestimmt
Wir sind unterwegs, wenn der Wind weht
Denn wir fliegen nur umher wie eine Feder im Wind
Wir finden unseren Weg, wenn der Wind weht

Ich wollte immer schon
Alle glücklich machen, doch wie soll das gehen?
Ich mein, ich wollte gehen,
Doch heute seh ich deine Äuglein tränen
Du stehst unter Druck, hast ‘ne Menge Stress, ist schon okay
Doch nur solange du deinen Kopf nicht hängen lässt wie Orchideen
Häufig fehlt uns die Zeit und Lust, wir opfern neun von zehn
Damit der Wind zumindest einen von uns über die Wolken trägt
Ich flog aus der Asche so wie Phönix, könnte stolz erzählen
Doch halt es nicht für nötig wie ein König, der sein Volk versteht
Lausch dem Wind, wenn er dann mal wieder durch die Bäume weht
Doch denk daran, dass du nichts ändern kannst, wenn du nur Däumchen drehst
Ich mach mich von all den Sorgen frei, bevor ich Vollgas geb
Den Ort, an dem du morgen sein willst, solltest du schon heute sehen
Damit du sicher durch das Leben kommst
Die Hilfe kommt nicht nur zu spät,
Sie ist nicht mal auf dem Weg zu uns
Und nein, wir suchen keinen, der uns raus aus der Krise führt
Wir wollen einfach nur den Hauch einer Brise spüren

Wir wollen raus, viele gehen in dieser Gegend dahin
Wir sind unterwegs, wenn der Wind weht
Wir können den Engeln nicht vertrauen und bewegen uns blind
Wir finden unseren Weg, wenn der Wind weht
Ich würde so gerne wissen, wer über mein Leben bestimmt
Wir sind unterwegs, wenn der Wind weht
Denn wir fliegen nur umher wie eine Feder im Wind
Wir finden unseren Weg, wenn der Wind weht

Ich fühl mich federleicht, ich flieg, wenn der Wind weht
Meine Freiheit hat mir niemand genommen
Als unsere Vorfahren damals losgingen, wusste niemand wo’s hingeht
Doch auch sie sind am Ziel angekommen

Ich fühl mich federleicht, ich flieg, wenn der Wind weht
Meine Freiheit hat mir niemand genommen
Als unsere Vorfahren damals losgingen, wusste niemand wo’s hingeht

MoTrip,"Ah, ah, das geht von Aachen in die Welt, ah
Das geht an alle, die mich nicht kennen und alle, die mich kennen
Mo Dirty Shit Trip

Das geht an alle, die mich nicht kennen und alle, die mich kennen
Ich bin nich' Cory Gunz, doch ich komme mit der „Cannon“
Irgendwas geschah, wie auch immer sie es nennen
Trip, ich bin jetzt digital wie die Bilder, die sie scannen
Ich krieg das Signal und fang an zu rennen
Ich bin immer noch nicht da, doch kann jetzt langsam was erkennen
Ihr wollt nich' dafür bezahlen, ihr wollt alles nur noch brennen
Ich als Künstler hab' die Wahl, harte Arbeit oder flennen
Komm, wir müssen uns verein' und die Masse nicht mehr trennen
Denn so viele können allein all die Lasten nicht mehr stemmen
Informieren uns weltweit über Sachen, die uns hemmen
So verliert sich unser Schrei, zwischen Masten und Antennen
Könntet ihr das Licht dimmen, jemand sollte die Gesangskabine dämmen
Ich steh' auf den Dämmen, um das Land zu überschwemmen
Ich verschwende meine Zeit nich' mehr mit Schach oder Backgammon
Ich mach' Business, wenn die anderen noch pennen

Das geht an alle, die mich nich' kennen
Und alle die mich kennen
Dieser Junge kann's
Ich bin die verbale 
Egal, wo sie mich hinstellen
Egal, wie sie mich nennen
Pure Arroganz, ich bin der, der alle

Und auch wenn du mich in die unterste Schublade packst, komm ich am Ende hoch
Ich schreibe, bis die Fruchtblase platzt, Embryo
Wenn mich die Engel hol'n, dann sitz' ich hier und warte
Mitten auf der Straße, hört ihr, was ich sage?
Vergessen wir, was war, heut Nacht bin ich zufrieden
Is' im Endeffekt egal, ob sie mich hassen oder lieben
Trip, ich denk' darüber nach, hab's nich' gemacht für ein paar Riesen
Ich sah' endlich mein' Vertrag und dann hab' ich unterschrieben
Ganz egal, wer jetzt noch aufmuckt, du kannst mir nichts verbieten
Diese Rapper sind wie Kautschuk und lassen sich verbiegen
Sie behandeln dich wie Bauschutt, lassen dich links liegen
Mir war klar, dass ich da raus muss, alles nur Intrigen
Ich hab' einfach kurz mein Ding gemacht und alle überstiegen
Denn ich hab' die Gabe, Rapper wie mit Waffen zu durchsieben
Ich werd so was wie der King, das is' praktisch schon erwiesen
Ich fühl' mich jetzt bereit und endlich lassen sie mich fliegen
Trip, ich lös' mich von der Schwerkraft und schwebe durch die Erdatmosphäre
Bitte fühl dich nich' versetzt, wenn ich dich ernsthaft bewege
Dieser Flow gibt dir Gefühle, die dich nachhaltig ändern
So wie der Frühling in arabischen Ländern
Ab sofort ist die Talfahrt beendet
Wegen mir geht dieser Maya-Kalender noch ein paar Jahre länger
Denn sie konnten kein' finden, der so flowt
Trip ist im Gebäude, du bist nich' ma' auf'm Hof

Ich glaub du spinnst, ich halt mich nicht an deine Regeln
Von wegen das hier ist nicht dein Haus
Und wenn ich dir mit meinem Ring in dein Gesicht reinhau'
Legst du dich erstmal für 'ne Weile hin und wachst dann nich' mehr auf
Das ist kein Ding, ich komm und knips dir deine Lichter aus
Und ich bleib freier als der Wind, weil mir der Richter glaubt
Ich blick heraus und sitz' in meinem Cabrio und wink (Hallo)
Die Sonne scheint, in meinem Radio läuft Pink (yeah)
Du hast schon jeden in deinem Barrio gezinkt, du bist so blöd
Du läufst bei Mario nach links, wie ein Kind
Mein Instinkt sagt mir immer „Trip, da musst du hin“ (""Danke"")
Du musst gerade bleiben, darin liegt der Sinn
(Fakt ist) Harte Arbeit steigert Umsatz und Gewinn
Und wenn das Glück nicht von alleine kommt, dann muss man es erzwingen

Ich bin wieder unterwegs und es gibt wieder viel zu regeln
Doch ich bleibe cool so lang' die Kasse stimmt

Harte Arbeit zahlt sich aus, wenn man lang genug hofft
Und wär ich nicht zufrieden, hätt ich einen anderen Job
Die Leute kriegen mit, dass einer nach dem anderen floppt
Bei diesen Spinnern ist noch immer nix zustande gekommen
Ich mein, ich schau mir diese Rapper an, sie wirken eingeschüchtert
Sabbern rum wie kleine Kinder und sind keine Künstler
Mein Homie macht es aus'm Herz doch verkauft nur
Das ist nicht fair, au hur!
Wie soll es enden, wenn es jetzt schon so beschissen läuft?
Ich kam aus dem Libanon hierher, doch kann inzwischen Deutsch
In der Schule schrieb ich vor dem Lehrer die Tapeten voll
Und heut' bin ich so fresh, dass mich die Hater nicht mehr haten woll'n
Jetzt sind die Regenwolken, die mir schon mein halbes Leben folgten, weg
Ich lernte, dass wir miteinander reden sollten
Ich hab gesehen wie Leute scheitern, weil sie einfach nich' verstehen wollten
Es tut mir Leid, doch ich muss gehen

I've been so long searching for you
And there ain't a thing that you can do
'Cause I'm gonna be there by tonight.

If you're feeling edgy then you better catch a train,
Or you may see my face at your window pane
I'm gonna get you by tonight.

I've listened and waited and watched every move

Got a million dollar contract
And a Cadillac too
And we're laying in the shade
Of a willow tree
Sipping on a glass of vintage '53

Gimme something that I want....

If you're straight or bent, don't have to pay a cent,
''cause she does it... Free!
Only twenty-three, but boy you're telling me that she does it,
She can make you feel like a little schoolboy
Tie you up in knots, or she can be a kill-joy
But if you find out that she gets about, just turn her round.

Let her come along and take you by the hand,
Then before too long you'll reach the promised land,
Any problems that you've got she'll understand

She's more than just a friend ...
Girls like her are really hard to find,
Maybe it's her inquiring mind,
Don't know what it is,
But she makes me feel like this...

Come along with me, I want you to see how she does it,
Can't control myself, nor can no-one else when she does it,
We can even see her at the same time,
Nothing's wrong with that, in fact she'll think it's fine
I don't mind if you don't mind,
so come on now before someone gets in ...

Gonna put you in the ground

There's a kind of misty morning
As I'm looking out 'cross town
Thinking 'bout my friends
Remembering what they said
And making me feel like a real lowdown

Well I saw that smoke stack lightning
When you pushed me to the brink
You got me worried, you got me mean
And when I'm mean I drink

And then a lot of wild talk was flying
About a tall cat sleeping around
Well I dunno who he is but I'm telling you this
When I catch up with him I'm gonna mow him down

When I get there tonight you better be back home
There's an ill wind blowing and it's bringing a storm
An' when I get there tonight you better be alone
There's an ill wind blowing and it's bringing a storm

Cause when I get there tonight I'm gonna be insane
There's an ill wind blowing and it's bringing a storm
I've had enough of your lip gonna cause you some pain
There's an ill wind blowing and it's bringing a storm
I'm gonna jump on a train

Now you've burned out all my money
Just as much as you could take
And then your love turned bad and now I'm mad
Cause I made a big mistake
But if you think I'm gonna take it
Lying down like a dog
Well you'd better think again
I'll fix you up for good
I told you I would
And I'm just about to jump on a real fast train

Will there come a time when sorrow's hard to find
And all those nursery rhymes will find a meaning
There's got to be a change, thoughts to rearrange
Does it seem so strange to try redeeming

Only time will show if the unrelenting blow
That's cast from down below does strike the ceiling
Life must still go on whatever's right or wrong
Realise what's gone and was never healing

Everything except which way to go
I cried oh God please take me will you take me please

(Yeah) Many a time (well I) swore up and down
I don't need none of this junk that's a floating round
I could quit - let me finish what I've got
After all this stuff sure costs a lot
Then I get my feet back on the ground
Now I can't tell nobody how to live their life
Even though inside we're all the same
All these things are toys I was playing with
You know, you know we're all losers in the end

(Well now) since I've been straight
I haven't been in my cups
I ain't shooting downs I ain't using ups
You know I'm still as crazy as a loon
Even though I don't run out and cop a spoon
Thank the good Lord God well I've had enough
I've got a friend and his name is Robertson
He told me ""Don't need to be stoned to know a friend
Believe me you're all beautiful people just the way you are
Tell me, what has that stuff done for you so far?""

I've been sitting here thinking I've been winking I've been blinking
Well I don't have to sit around no more on the nod
With my head in the air (you know)
I can do anything I can do it straight I can do it so much better now
Its gotta start
Right here in your own back yard
Yes it's gotta start back your own back yard
Everybody has their own beautiful back yard
You might find oil wells in your own back yard
You might find anything in your own back yard
You might even find my shadow in your own back yard
(Who knows what you might dig up)

As the wind died away, she sank way below her knees.
And as a hurricane passed by, she clutched the money from the sky.
She must have been at least a fathom high.

With all her golden ambitions, and dead rhinestones in her feet.
And when a stranger said she sucked, she just smiled, believing luck,
As she climed into his truck, to make a buck.
Oh my god, she's running 'round the trees,
Said she couldn't touch them because they're so real.

And it's a long way to Broadway from a forty second lay,
Or is it really just a couple of blocks away?
Now, I wonder if she wonders, if I wonder, if she wonders
About the times I put her down, when she seemed to be right under?
She told me morals are traditions, contradictions, superstitions.
See, Alice is always based on split decisions.

And digging what I thought was New York City.

I've tried, and I've tried but I can't understand.
Just the way you called out my name
Wasn't the same, it felt like a different game
And the way you called out my name....

After time has slipped away,
You may find that I'm still on your mind,
We'll have gone our separate ways
Much to far to turn around,

You'll remember all the things we went through,
Following me, following you for all time,
And you'll remember I still feel the same,
It's such a shame ....

I'll tell you something that you ought to know
If you're leaving home today,
You're turning your back on something so strong,
But I hope you find your way.

I'll tell you something that you ought to know
If you're leaving me today,
You're turning your back on a love that's so strong
That you might not find your way

If you're leaving me today
Don't turn your back on me,

Not tomorrow, but right now,
You look good, but you don't look nice,
Be my friend, just once or twice.

I don't want to settle down,
I just want to fool around
Gimme something that I want....

I want love, and I wannit now,
Not in two seconds, I wannit now,
You're feeling bad, aw, that's a shame,
Come over here, I'll fix the pain!

Mott the Hoople,"Anything you want, anything you need, she does it,
She don't even care, if you make her bleed, she does it,
She can do it better than Judy or Suzie, 
Wouldn't want to say that she's really choosy.
But if you find out that she gets about, just turn her round
If you're straight or bent, don't have to pay a cent,
''cause she does it... Free!
Only twenty-three, but boy you're telling me that she does it,
She can make you feel like a little schoolboy
Tie you up in knots, or she can be a kill-joy
But if you find out that she gets about, just turn her round.

Let her come along and take you by the hand,
Then before too long you'll reach the promised land,
Any problems that you've got she'll understand

She's more than just a friend ...
Girls like her are really hard to find,
Maybe it's her inquiring mind,
Don't know what it is,
But she makes me feel like this...

Come along with me, I want you to see how she does it,
Can't control myself, nor can no-one else when she does it,
We can even see her at the same time,
Nothing's wrong with that, in fact she'll think it's fine
I don't mind if you don't mind,
so come on now before someone gets in ...

Let her come along and take you by the hand,
Then before too long you'll reach the promised land,
Any problems that you've got she'll understand

She's more than just a friend ...",She Does It
Mott the Hoople,"I changed my name in search of fame to find the Midas touch
Oh I wish I'd never wanted then what I want now, twice as much
We crossed the mighty oceans and we had a few divides
But we never crossed emotion, for we felt too much inside

You know all the tales we tell, you know the band so well
Still I feel, somehow, we let you down
We went off somewhere on the way and now I see we have to pay
The rock n' roll circus is in town

Buffin' lost his child-like dreams and Mick lost his guitar
And Verden grew a line or two and Overend's just a rock n' roll star
Behind these shades, the visions fade, as I learn a thing or two
Oh but if I had my time again you all know just what I'd do

Rock n' roll's a loser's game, it mesmerizes and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights and for the sounds
We went off somewhere on the way and now I see we have to pay
The rock n' roll circus is in town

So rock n' roll's a loser's game, it mesmerizes and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights and for the sounds
The greasepaint still sticks to my face, so what the hell I can't erase
The rock n' roll feeling from my mind

From my mind
From my mind
From my mind

And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers

I am gone - disappeared

'Cause you play a loser's game,
But then if I am a winner,
Why then am I so ashamed?

I never knew her name.
