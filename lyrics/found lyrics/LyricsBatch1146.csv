Over and over, what more can I do
Over and over, my friend says I'm a fool
But over and over, I'll be a fool for you.

Walk, with personality
Talk, with personality
Smile, with personality
Charm, with personality

And, plus, you've got a great big heart
So over and over, oh, I'll be a fool to you
Now over and over, what more can I do

Over and over, honey love it's the truth

Sacha Distel,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Sackville All Stars,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

With those blues on parade

We won't stand and watch until we're six feet underground

As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace

Opposing lessened armies, they say are here to stay
But no one knows until we try, what we all can do
I won't watch children die, it's up to me and you

Our world is divided, the boundaries have been drawn
Ideas are decided by where you have been born
You can't judge people by the government of their land
They're flesh and blood like us - why don't you understand?

The future is our burden, we can't stand and watch
As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace

Sacred Reich,"Generals gathered in their masses 
Just like witches at black masses 
Evil minds that plot destruction 
Sorcerers of death's construction 
In the fields the bodies burning 
As the war machine keeps turning 
Death and hatred to mankind 
Poisoning their brainwashed minds 
Oh lord yeah! 

Politicians hide themselves away 
They only started the war 
Why should they go out to fight? 
They leave that role to poor 

Time will tell on their power minds 
Making war just for fun 
Treating people just like pawns in chess 
Wait 'til their judgment day comes 
Yeah! 

Now in darkness world stops turning 
Ashes where the bodies burning 
No more war pigs have the power 
Hand of God has struck the hour 
Day of judgment, God is calling 
On their knees the war pig's crawling 
Begging mercy for their sins 
Satan laughing spreads his wings 
All right now!",War Pigs

How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Sadao Watanabe,"That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

That night in Berkeley square.",A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square
Sadao Watanabe,"They say that falling love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful
Sadao Watanabe,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Sadao Watanabe,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me
Oh won't you stay old fashioned with me
Oh please stay old fashioned with me",I'm Old Fashioned
Sadao Watanabe,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Sadao Watanabe,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song
Sadao Watanabe,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Sadao Watanabe,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In
Sadao Watanabe,"Strange dear, but true, dear
When I'm close to you, dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love with you am I

Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you am I

In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care

So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours 'til I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you, my love, am I",Ev'rytime We Say Goodbye

[Verse 1]
Men's words can't describe the great X
Is it the shoes or the fantastic
That got cha' callin' out to ya girlfriend
Boo banged who last night
Made the man leave baby
Forget about Stanley
For real I came charged off the Staten Isle
I'm like three or four down twisted
Givin' away smoke
Sweatin' takin' off my coat
Money walked by all fly and dropped my drink on my leather
And now my shit is fucked up
And now I gotta do with dollar bill I see potential
And I got a eye for spottin' kind of like Spike
Miss Chocolate, Miss Brown, Miss Black
Miss Long Legs, hey I'm ready to wrap
Can't do that
A vision of the deep, dark soul of home
And claimin' niggas with dro
Hey watch the honey roll, check it
Surround sound hides ya crass
Tell ya neighbor lies
No that wasn't me that was my cousin
Hey you're a school girl
But hey you're in a different world
You're a fly chick
Now ya want to learn a different trick

[Hook: with 1 repeated in background]
Now can I do it again, do it again
Steady do it again, do it again
And then ya do it again, do it again
Steady do it again, do it again
And then ya do it again, do it again

[Verse 2]
Life is slim put me on to a game
Had a lot of style in that last profile
Got her nails filed and her hair done weekly
A real name thrower, y'all niggas know her
Talkin' about garbles comin' out in ten
Drinkin' goblets of gin and ain't givin' up trim
Tease a nigga, make em' want to squeeze a trigger
They say a woman's best is diamonds and a man is a dog
Better come in from that fog that you swimming in
Brown skin, laid out in bed is real feminine
I'll put that R. Kelly on ya
Fingers have some smelly on ya
The boy's dry humps are now man pumps
Can he go deeper than the explorer
120th street horror
Let's get naked by the laptop
Can I snap and pop
You can squeeze and then stop and be all up in that piece
I'm the late night window climber, you are the rhymer
Ya mom thought you heard you wouldn't be fuckin' in the house
Not you momma's sweetheart, undercover freak-heart
Imagine if she would've seen us intertwined and pretzel style
Legs and arms, hummin' with the radiator clickin'
Our soft patience quickin'
I couldn't slow the pace
I bust off three nuts and man the sun's in my face

[Hook: with 1 in background]

[Verse 3]
I'm turnin' around handlin' things and then BAM!
A toss of that ass hit me like out of nowhere
And hey like a flashback honey
There was a one should slipped off since day one
Check it out, now can I do it again
Sure I can do it again
You're on some friction, bring along ya friend
See how the world turns
Look beyond the floor burns
At least I have concerns
I didn't take it like a chicken
I love ya sexually plus intellectually

Of the OK Corral  Cowboy style

Big niggaz from uptown  ridin into Tahoe's 
Saloon settin  kids is walkin round 
Drinkin whiskey and scotch, strictly out of shotglasses

Half-pipes to scramblers, and free for Wild Cowboys 
You never bring decoys if you want to make real nouse 
The bigger the stick, the bigger the fire 
I never hit a man in the back, a coward acts like that 
Lay out my black hat cause I feel like the bad man

Oh it's the Marshal Cooper, and I love how he doin this 
Women sayin don't get hurt, and I ain't plannin on it 
Ten steps taken as I hit the blam factor 
His dick to act up, was death the benefactor 
Leave him twitchin in the dirt like Cousin Harold from the Menace

Sadat X,"Verse One:

People often see me in jams, and be thinkin I'm high
No that just be my lazy eye
What's your reply to the evidence against you
Your girlfriend found one hand just one loan credit
Exclaimed you was fuckin you claim downtown
where Fred can beat that, win that, quick nigga wins the ballgames
Tailwind nose is a must on any con any truck
When riding on luck you catch an empty
Riding on the wave is real good, suave bola
You be playin the low low, while your girlfriend be like, ""Oh no!""
I seen it with my own eyes and I know that it was him
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Episodes of Free Willy bring strife in your life
You can flip and use the gift of gab, but don't waver
If you love your girlfriend, then you better save her
Cause the next man is eager, to run up in yours
Be in her drawers, put your girl on her fours
Sometime's the girls game's tighter than a sloppy ass nigga
I got my girl locked down hey that's the truth nigga
She gone away for the weekend, man she right uptown
Runnin around with my man Boogie Brown
I keep your arms in the air, your feet on the floor
While you're over there frontin with these kids
your girl's givin jaw

Chorus:

I been doin my own thing (2X)

Verse Two:

Oh you got your own dough, from where I don't know
You hold degrees from two universities
Girl you're worth cheese in the nine-seis
Sadat owns apartment keys, is it Alize for Dolo
You got a mind on top of that spine plus the lump lump
Highly educated and highly motivated
Workin girl skirt tight love to hurt
What to exert, I break your next man's pocket
Smell of freak fragrant, unlike the vagrant
You can pay the rent always, and don't be gettin hallways
In the bed girlie and at work by nine
Put on the work force ridin on a iron horse
Bring it home to dad, the one piece cause I'm here
Workout baby doll and keep yo' career
No chiggedy, no diggedy, not you
Glad that I got you, when I did
Cause you was runnin wild with this out of style kid, no class
Light in the ass, white enough to pass
Shotproof glass for the midnight mass

Chorus

Verse Three:

I have seen this chick at the bar, furiously she was searchin
She want to wet her whistle with the glass of bubbly
She want the Willie Dom not the cheap sherry
Tryin to front with the outfit that's goin back tomorrow
Now she's makin me dream, if she played to force it
Dom she want to toss it, back in that
Jet when the bottle's gone and that's a fact
Give you the wrong number knowin it's the wrong number
Front on a nigga never that, not I
If you see me at the bar it's dry throat
because I'm keepin these hoes dry
Hey lookie there there's Harlem Slim!
Lookin at me, but then you're walkin with him
I be a little old for them young girl games
I know a lot of tricks but I ain't namin no names
One burnt my man, left his beef in flames
Actin ill wild like the untamed dames
Just came to mingle where I flowed the river Thames
When I was young in the clubs they played Cool James
Get rich without jail, is one of my aims
You remember Good Times, with courderoy jeans

Sadat X,"Check it, check it, check it, the new reign.
Yeah, Wild Cowboys, 1-2-1-2, yeah.
Diamond D, D-I-T-see, the Crates.
Brand Nubian still up in here, no question.
I'm Shawn Black, so stop asking me questions.

This solo thing I'm doin' here is real to me,
The most serious thing in my life, I can say up to this point.
My reputation is at stake, this where the men are mad
Separate, me from the sons put me with the big guns.
My energy now radiates from leads, grow trees.
I'm every time like crime on frustrated black men.
Hey you, and ya buddy, why y'all both need to study.
That my past records shows, my pros is untraceable
Flows will lace that ass, full fold in and
I'm nice now, five years ago way back in the beginning,
When I was runnin' in back yards,
While people was playin' cards
And eatin' barbecue, I'm one of the only few
Sayin' take that pork off ya motherfuckin' fork.
Then they would front and cut out the mic,
And I'd be out on my bike.
Now Lil' Mo was there, Marvin Spark was there;
This is in the eighties now, the start of my long career.

[Chorus]
Move on, black man, move on.
Move on, black man, move on.
New year, same game, same shit goes on.
New year, same game, same shit goes on.

We was young cats playin' Latin quarters;
We was playin' roof top, yeah don't stop,
And I was there at Union Square when KRS-One did his thing.
So why y'all know what I'm bringin' to this ball game.
I got stacks of rhymes and papers and notes,
Lil' phrases written and my catchiest quotes.
I free them Hatians off them boats and give em' the finest ocean liners.
I hate brothers that's walkin' but mentally in recliners.
Hey who's that behind with the plastic and them scanners?
In the year two thousand will ya be on ya manners?
In concentration camps, wet floors and cold,
And population control keeps ya welfare comin'.
No more big fams, Uncle Sam damns,
And this MC Big Brother want the platinum
At your expense, niggas ain't been heard from since.
I walk light and carry the big stick.
Give out my views to blacks and Jews, and whoever choose to get hit
With my shit; I'm like the snowball effect
And why y'all should all stand erect when I pass.
Corporal with the ranch groove style, leadin' profile.
First leave the whole crowd thirsty and wet,
Wild Cowboys leadin' New York and that's my set.
I'm down with Lil' L and my man Akinyele;
I love her but I can't stand her mother.
Me and her brother ain't had the blessings to lead,
Kind of hard that I'm the G-O-D.

[Chorus]

Yeah my rent is due and the phone bill too,
Long distance is dead, got to see ConAir.
All of these bills is risin' in my head,
But wait I got the child support.
Got the car note as the after thought,
Got the school loan then after college that was blown.
Did I forget with my car a lot of tickets I owe?
Now niggas hate, my youth it constantly grows.
Always need clothes, hey that's how it goes.
Word, and my wife, I gotta keep my home life in tact;
Some of her friends try to end me then try to act friendly.
That's that bullshit, yo now that's that bullshit.
Now my crew all money and I'm tellin' em' to hang on,
I'm tryin' to hang but sometimes that don't be workin'.
Niggas talkin' about gettin' a package and goin' down South and murkin'
In Carolinas or to V-A with the stash spot.
Tryin' to hit the jackpot, tryin' to hit the jackpot.",Move On

And I rate much more than pretenders

Freewheeling poses a lot of death, wack rappers waste a lot of breaths 

The cognac is back in a mid size glass wit ice 

I'm already nice, who got the dice 

So let's roll, hold on, let me gain control

Now for the good things in life, Show, let's keep this crowd minglin
Been everywhere like twice, my latest trip been to England
Learned this whole scene from the Grand Puba
Peace to Lord Jamar and Nas Escobar
My people Crime Family, they finally got a chance
Long live Ralph [Name] and his crazy man Sam
My man [Name], can I get a suit from Mecca?
Brother [Name] from Karl Kani, can I get a shirt so I can be fly?
I'd also like a Walker Wear suit made from April
Hit me off in May when I'm heard on Ed and Dre, Scoop
Jackson on the late night, New Jersey week night
??? say it, my joint they better play it
Rhyme after rhyme after rhyme after rhyme
Line after line after line after line 
Somebody said did I know my man Kid Capri?
I grew up on him and my man Brucie Bee
The lone mic for hire like the viking
If shit ain't to my liking
I run and get the axe
It's not that I'm a racist, it's just I'm pro-blacks
You can't sleep in this here game 
Cause there's cheese and
There's a million MC's in public housin 
A nigga'll step on your back
Just to get a crack
Got to go reign, the whole thing is like a game
I ain't never been gold, but I got the platinum fame
Like this

[ CHORUS ]

My energetic show is just half of the picture
I take your suggestion, no question inflicted
Add to it, then get bad to it
The music man and I got what's hot
I be the pleasure principle
Reignin and restrain from buggin out
And luggin out the heavy arms
I'm to rap what Allen Iverson's to Georgetown
The truth sayer, never team player
I move, groove, groove and parlay
If I could bone every day, would I go that way?
Check it out
At first I'll take a little lead to lead the whole world
Jump and make the earth shake and expose the fake
This is no coincidence, this was bound to be
Tell the young history is bein made
Goin backwards I had a low one, a baldie, and a fade
Bein fresher neverthelesser makes me go all out
Cause I'm out in the street too much
Not to be too clutched
Showbiz is my man, no question, ace
Hit me off with the head-nod ???
My tunnel vision has my shit on collision
We're makin dough, makin investments
And stackin up the property
30 years from now the young boys is livin properly
As the foundin father
Of the style that niggas ain't even bother to find out
It will blow your mind out
Missioned in the circles of royalty
Wild Cowboys I owe my whole loyalty
At the scene of the crime, the new essence of the rhyme
Comes out like a dime piece, braided and shredded
Wack rappers get mean shouts from my team
The riches, the bitches and all the fan fanfare
But I stay aware just like the black bear
'96 is my year

Cock it back nigga, cock it back

When I'm dead save my bones
Take D-N-A and make clones
Award, afford me luxury in my old age
After these years I should be slidin' on the gold stage
Missed the blades fifty, they left a nigga off the whole page
Fifty motherfuckers that was better than me
That mean fifty motherfuckers was boiling hot
That's a lot, I can see that, that's a plot
Y'all bring y'all best five to the game
And I'm gonna do the same
And if y'all win I'm burst from the same way I came
The great Dat aligned with a bo-day of Arabs
They said don't fly black, yo just play cabs
Y'all happy y'all had a good day, y'all niggas slave slabs
Y'all niggas got money then huh y'all niggas get paid tabs
Save my mic in a steel case for when they blast this place
And I can still be a hero to my race
Y'all know I can't change my face
That's why I only move with pros
Who move that eighty long money when the bright sunshine
And the streets was kind but we can't rewind
I want that new money, tight fittin' jewel money
Mine's on tour, so I can take no more
So y'all niggas better knock it off

Blame my check bein' late for this rage
Blame child support for makin' me beats on the mailman

Nigga crash my whip, you seen 'em hit 'em 'cause he was an old man
I gotta cold hand these days and no heart
You believe in that bullshit baby please don't start
Cock it once and it means no stress
House cleaned and you fumed into my favorite dress
You say I feelin' best, hey broad don't gas me
And don't ever take no money outta my pockets, yo just ask me
See me down the block drinkin' Bud with the Mexicans
Speakin' broken Spanish, I know a lil' I manage

I'm about to leave New York I can't stay
The way shit is goin' I might have to get away
All day tryin' to hit me with prices I can't pay
Niggas bust the guns, got to duck and stray
Is the block clear, nah y'all can' rock here
With the twelve, twelve, thirty-eight, and fifty-eight, fifty-eight
If we don't get it done here we gon' take it outta state
Burn something in the air, let the room be few
My broads gon' give a show 'cause I told 'em so

He'd probably tell me...slow down

Close ya pants nigga or ya might go down
Fuck a hole through ya condom now ya ass got a child

Lay out broads with the haze, lay out for two days
Might tease the adventure
See me freaked out with two chicks smashin' em' out
Like a nigga had two dicks
And the breeze done shook all the leaves off the trees
Leads to homicide with the suit jacket
Who want the keys in the tight package
I walkin' past the park with Spark
That's in the plain clothes harassin' the same niggas
And smashin' the same hoes
My lil' son Sammie hold the weasel
Behind the phone booth and the wall is the teasil
With em' up, we gon' live like ghetto stars, how we are
We gon' fuck with all the broads and drink shit out the bar
We gon' snatch a bitch too, throw em' in back of the car
Money boss be a force
Blast a gun in exhaust
I don't want it no more, who had they coat and they ring on the fourth floor
Yeah, let's get these broads and get the fuck outta here

I got pussy on my mind
But gotta keep it on the grind
Track the wrong bitch, lusted for a life of crime
Gotta sign, got the blind
That's why I fuck em' feed em'
Duck em' leave em'
Then act like I don't need em'
Because I don't need em'

Sade,"Sally, you opened out your arms to all those young men.
And girl you had room,
For every one of them.

You're the only girl.
Who are the only girl on Barry and Third
Sure as hell,
You're the only one who cares.

So put your hands together for Sally.
She saved all those young men.
Put your hands together for Sally.
She's the one who cared for them.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day in New York.

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen,
Zoot suit and shiny shoes.
He ran around town and threw his mentholated laughter.
Most of his memories drowned.

But he remembers what his mother used to shout.
She used to shout,
""One day, surely son,
The streets are gonna tire you out.""

So put your hands together for Sally.
She's the one who cared for him.
Put your hands together for Sally.
She was there when his luck was running thin.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day in New York.

Tommy had a wife and family,
But the needle came between the love and the hard times.
Thank God for Sally,
She was there through the misery.

Just a place to lay his head.
Just about better off than dead.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day

Vince, came up from the country.
Couldn't even find himself a room.
Thinking about his babies.
They're further away than the moon.

With no money but his pride in his pocket.
There's really no way he can go home.
There's a picture of his woman in his locket.
Most of all he doesn't want to be alone.

So put your hands together for Sally.
She's the one who cared for him.
Put your hands together for Sally.
She was there when his luck was running thin.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day in New York.",Sally
Sade,"Diamond life, lover boy
He move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale

Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase

A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator

Sade,"Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She probably had less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk she knew

Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
How did you get that?
""Do you really want to know"", she said

""Every winter was a war"", she said
""I want to get what's mine""

Won't try to deny where she came from
You can see it in her pride
And the raven in her eyes
Try show her a better way
She'll say, ""You don't know what you've been missing""
By the time she blinks you know she won't be listening

Givin' me somethin' that's taboo

You give me the sweetest taboo
(You give me, you give me the)
That's why I'm in love with you
(With you)
You give me, keep giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

You've got the biggest heart
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
Every day is Christmas, and every night is New Year's Eve
Will you keep on loving me?
Will you keep on, will you keep on
Bringing out the best in me?",The Sweetest Taboo [Live][Multimedia Track]

Sade,"We were waiting for the bus
No-one much around but us
Then I see this young boy cut a look at me

I'm stunned
In a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way
She liked his eyes she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure

He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking acted like she didn't care

That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Even to the angels it may sound like a lie

For you child
He has the troops and extra backup standing by
For you child
For you he's the best he can be
For you child
For you he's the best he can be
Oh child don't you know
Your daddy love come with a life time guarantee

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Yeah daddy love you child
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame

Daddy love you yeah

It' only love, love, love, love

Sade,"You baby were like the sky
You held me up to let me fly
That's just like you to tell me
I've nothing to fear

I am a broken house
I'm holding on to broken vows
Now it's easy for me to see

It couldn't be that easy
It'd have to be much harder
That's just like you to tell me
I've nothing to fear

I could be falling free
Falling all these years
Now it's easy for me to see

Sun on my face
Wind in my hair
Falling down

Flying as slow as I can
Not trying to reach the land
Just falling somewhere

It couldn't be that easy
It'd have to be much harder
Meanwhile I'm loving you",Be That Easy
Sade,"The ground is full of broken stones 
The last leaf has fallen 
I have nowhere to turn now 
Nor east nor west 
North or south 
And all that's ahead of me 
And everything I know 
I know nothing so 
So bring me home 

Put me on a plate with petals and a fire 
And send me out to sea 
Turn my angry sword against my heart 
And let me free 

The dawn holds the heaviness of the night 
I've heard the restless sighs and lovers lies 
The brook, the beach and seen the devil's eyes 
So bring me home 

I've cried for the lives I've lost 
Like a child in need of love 
I've been so close but far away from god 
My tears flow like a child's in need of love 
I've cried the tears 
So let the tide take me 
I won't fight 
I've cried the tears 

The small step I need to take is a mountain 
Stretched out like a lazy dog 
Send me to slaughter 
Lay me on the railway line 
I'm far away from god 
My tears flow like a child's in need of love 
I've cried the tears 
So build the fire and light the flame 
Bring me home",Bring Me Home
Sade,"You'll be surprised girl,
Soon they will mean nothing to you
They will fall into their own
With them to
There's nothing
Nothing that you have to do

In another time girl
Tears wont leave a trace
In another time girl
In another place

You been down girl,
There were whispers of hail storms in your face
Your so tired of waiting
For something to change

They don't know what to do with
Something so good
But you wouldn't heart them,
You wouldn't heart them if you could
On of these days they gonna fall into their world
And they will know exactly what they did to you

Darling I just want you to know
Your tears wont leave a trace,
In another time girl,
In another time girl
In another place

Darling I just want you to know
Your tears wont leave a trace,
In another time girl,
In another time girl",In Another Time

But a voice inside me said

You know there's something oh, that you need to know
It's gonna be alright
Said there's something that you need to know
It's gonna be alright

And when in this life, in this life
When I can only turn my chin
I know it's gonna be alright

When this big old town is closing in
I have lost again

Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on
Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on

Could be I won't be wrong
There's a long hard road ahead

I who could, pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet, and I gave you my love

So why did he make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

Sade,"How could you
You are the river
Pour out of this life

How could you
You are the morning bird
Who sang me into life every day
Fly away

You are the blood of me
The harvest of my dreams
There's nowhere I can find peace

And the silence won't cease
Nothing's quite how it seems
The ghost of my joy
Won't let me be

If you set me free I will not run
I will not run
I will not run",Morning Bird
Sade,"In my heart
Your love has found
The safest hiding place
Inside is a field
And trees and a lake
Around is a wall
No-one from hell could break

In there you'll shine
In there you will cry
My heart has been a lonely warrior

Who's been to war
So you can be sure
In my heart your love has found
The safest hiding place

Inside is a stream
Around is a wall
No-one from hell could break

In there will shine
The light of heaven's eye
There you will cry
My heart's been a lonely warrior

Who's been to war
So you can be sure
Your love's in a sacred place
The safest hiding place
My heart has been a lonely warrior before
Who's been to war
So you can be sure",The Safest Place
Sade,"When I found out this love's undone
I was like a gun
Sure as it was over
Felt like nothing good could come

Sure as it's gonna play and play
Like Michael back in the day

I'm gonna peel you away

Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
Cause you're not right within

I love you so
Sometimes love has to let go

So this time don't thing it's a lie
I say goodbye

Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
Cause you're not right within

Now it's time

Now as I begin
It couldn't be right cause you're not right within

Sade,"I've lost the use of my heart
But I'm still alive
Still looking for the life
The endless pool on the other side
It's a wild wild west
I'm doing my best

I'm at the borderline of my faith,
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
In the front line of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

I'm a soldier of love.
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I've been torn up inside (oh!)
I've been left behind (oh!)
So I ride
I have the will to survive

In the wild wild west,
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive

I am love's soldier!

I wait for the sound
(oh oh)

I know that love will come (that love will come)
Turn it all around

I'm a soldier of love (soldier of love)
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I have lost but I don't doubt
So I ride, I have the will to survive
In the wild wild west,
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive

I am love's soldier!

I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around

And then being denied,
Waited too long for the feeling to die

Ils ont du soucis √† se faire, √ßa fait longtemps que j‚Äôdors plus
J‚Äôai des visions tordues, j‚Äôvois des kilos d‚Äôor pure
J‚Äôaimerais rentrer chez ORPI, prendre une baraque √† la ronne-da

On aime cadrer les R1, faire crier les RS4 Break
On s'allume sans GPS, nique sa m√®re si les balles s'perdent
La t√™te pleine de pri√®res si jamais √ßa tourne au vinaigre
Pr√™ts √† s'encastrer dans le mur, le cr√¢ne contre l'appuie-t√™te
J'suis pas n√© dans les toilettes, pourtant j'm√®ne une vie de merde
J'aimerais baiser la Terre enti√®re, jusqu'√† ce que j'ai plus d'sperme

Avec le mal on pactise, pour all√©ger nos factures
Si jamais j'passe en radio, c'est toute la France que j'fracture
On attendrit pas la rue, on embrasse pas un cactus
En face j'vois que des acteurs, demande au poto Farctus
Dans le 9.3zoo m√™me les barbus roulent en Brabus
La violence est d'actu, y'a pas qu'Apple qu'est tactile
C'est le casse du si√®cle et j'braque ma chance √† l'arme factice
Extr√™mement r√©actif, toujours un temps d'avance

A chaque fois qu'ils montent sur sc√®ne ils risquent de se p√©ter une hanche

J'garde ce que j'ai en t√™te m√™me si l'avenir √† la gorge tranch√©e

Le 93 c'est Bagdad, donc faut que t'√©vites la BAC man
Sous un soleil de plomb, de temps en temps des pluies de magma
J'suis pas la pour te faire peur de ma ville
Y'a des jours je sors que la nuit
Sur les gros ter-ter de coke, des anges ont brutalement perdu la vie
Que Dieu nous prot√®ge qu'il nous √©carte du Diable
Tous les jours tu vas p√©ter un c√¢ble
Plus de mecs calme que des bais√©s du cr√¢ne

La balistique ramasse plus de balles chez nous qu'√† Roland Garros
Paro, j'crache avec mes tripes
J'm√©corche vif, un avenir en porcelaine voil√† pourquoi j'√©gorge le beat
C'est mon seul moyen de m'en sortir, amortir
Abandonner, jamais j'pr√©f√®re plonger nu dans les orties

Sadek,"Ce matin je me suis r√©veill√© √† 16h30
Ma m√®re rentrait des courses, elle est rentr√©e dans ma chambre
Je me couche √† 8h du mat', toute la nuit j'ai fait la f√™te
Elle m'a dit ""Trouve un taf!"" elle m'a fait mal √† la t√™te (C'est bon!)
Donc je m'arrache de la baraque, je vais tra√Æner dans la tess'
Bouge pas, deux secondes, y'a ma meuf qui m‚Äôappelle (Attends attends)
Elle a trouv√© un mail en fouillant dans mon Facebook (Sa m√®re!)
Si t'y croyais, que y'a que dans le rap que je baise tout
J'ai pas envie de blablater, je trouverai plus tard une excuse
Je ferme mon t√©l√©phone et je monte dans le 4x4 Lexus
Qu'on m'a pr√™t√© la veille pour 2-3 semaines
Un service contre un service
On se d√©brouille, on fait de l'oseille
Et je suis en train de monter sur les Champs
Je veux leur foutre le seum gentillement
J'ai cartonn√©, j'√©tais √† 200
√Ä part √ßa rien de bien m√©chant

Ma m√®re me prend la t√™te, c'est pas graaave
Ma meuf m'a cram√©, c'est pas graaave
J'ai cartonn√© la caisse, c'est pas graaave
Mais si tu veux croquer mon grec, √ßa c'est graaave

A peine sorti de l‚Äôh√¥pital, on m‚Äôa dirig√© au poste
Ils ont trouv√© 2 kilogrammes de shit dans mon coffre (C‚Äôest pas moi)
Je bicrave plus, aussi innocent qu‚Äôune bonne s≈ìur
Mais l√† je suis grill√©, je suis cram√©, je suis dans le toaster
Hors de question de poucave, j‚Äôassume et je ferme ma gueule
M√™me si √ßa me fout le seum, je dois assumer tout seul
Ils me foutent en cellule, kho j‚Äôai perdu la parole
Et l√† je tombe nez √† nez avec 3 mecs que j‚Äôai carotte
Je leur ai mis dans le boule #JohnnyArnaqueur
Je les ai ras√© de pr√®s et j‚Äô√©tais pas coiffeur
Sur la vie de ma m√®re, ils m‚Äôont pas fait de fleur
Ils m‚Äôont niqu√© √† terre, je passais un sale quart d‚Äôheure
J‚Äô√©tais cens√© passer du bon temps
Ces sales b√¢tards m‚Äôont fait sauter une dent
Ils m‚Äôont laiss√© baigner dans mon sang
A part √ßa, rien de bien m√©chant

Ils ont p√©t√© le kamaz, c'est pas graaave
J'ai fini en gard'√† v', c'est pas graaave
On m'a p√©t√© la gueule, c'est pas graaave
Mais si tu veux croquer mon grec, √ßa c'est graaave

J'arrive devant la juge, muet comme une carpe (Bonsoir Madame La Juge)
Je sens que √ßa va barder je joue mes derni√®res cartes
Si la poisse √©tait une drogue j'en ferais une overdose
C'est bizarre mais son visage me dit quelque chose
(Ah ouais je l'ai d√©j√† vu)
√áa y est je m'en rappelle, j'esp√®re qu'elle se rappelle pas
J'ai martyris√© son fils il √©tait en Segpa
Je l'ai mis √† l'amende jusqu'√† maintenant je l‚Äôeffraie
Je l'ai tellement fait bugu√© jusqu'√† maintenant il b√©guais
Et, je fais pas faire le mitho franchement je suis en panique
Elle s'est souvenue de moi en lisant mon nom de famille
(Nan, pas moi)
Dans ses yeux j'ai compris, aller simple la son-pri
Malheur sur malheur, en une journ√©e ils m'ont tout pris
Gros j'ai la poisse depuis la naissance
Je vais rester coffr√© pour longtemps
Je vais s√ªrement tomber pour 10 ans
A part √ßa, rien de bien m√©chant
(Rien de bien m√©chant gros)

Convoqu√© chez la juge, c'est pas graaave
Elle a reconnu ma t√™te, c'est pas graaave
Je vais finir au placard, c'est pas graaave

Je suis tomb√© dans le rap par accident
A 11 ans je me suis fait renvers√© en bas de chez moi
J'ai fr√¥l√© la mort sur un bloc de ciment
J'√©tais pas cens√© survivre, √ßa m'a donn√© la foi
Clou√© sur mon lit pendant plus de 12 mois
Immobilis√© j'ai fait que prendre du poids
C'est dans mon malheur que j'ai trouv√© ma voie
Des milliers de couleurs apparaissent sur ma toile
Pour passer le temps j'ai commenc√© √† √©crire
Des images et des mots que j'√©tais incapable de dire
On √©touffe nos peines dans la col√®re et les rires
Je suis mari√© √† mon art pour le meilleur et le pire

Si un jour je dois prier √ßa sera le mektoub

Des t√¢ches d'encres, ont entach√© mon v√©cu
J'√©coutais du rap pour panser mes blessures
J'ai commenc√© les clashs, g√©n√©ration 8 mile
Je sais que devant le coll√®ge ils se rappellent de mes phases
A mon carnet de chasse, plus de 200 visages
Plus d'un millier de freestyles, c'est un besoin vital
Rapper pour oublier toutes ces putains d'images
Je veux plus jamais voir ma m√®re sur un lit d'h√¥pital
Sans piti√©, je les √©limine me toucher ils peuvent pas
Demande au Quai 54, il me suffit d'une seule phase
Avec Hamadoun je voulais devenir une resta
Mais il m'a r√©pondu que le rap ne l'int√©resse pas, n'est-ce pas?

C'est le mektoub, le mektoub

Si on doit m'enterrer tu sais que c'est le mektoub
Si un jour je dois prier √ßa sera le mektoub

Doudoune en couverture j'ai montr√© que j'√©tais un guerrier
Que j'avais plus de ressources qu'il n'y avait de bulle dans le Perrier
Je l'ai harcel√©, la dalle a parl√© pour moi
Forc√© d'aller tout droit ou de dispara√Ætre dans un trou noir
J'ai promis au quartier, que je ferai jamais de coup bas
Que d'ici 3 ans je serais m√™me plus fort que Booba!
5 ans dans une cave √† forger mon √©criture
Bicrave par n√©cessit√©, r√™vant de petites coupures
J'irais chercher ma place, j'irais chercher mon bif
Booska P√©trification, il m'a suffit d'une seule prise
On g√¢che pas les munitions, gros, je mets tout le monde d'accord
Avec 2 freestyles j'ai sign√© en Major,
""La l√©gende de Johnny niuum"", sort en 2012
Mon son vient du c≈ìur, il a tourn√© partout
Je vous ai raconter le d√©but de mon parcours
Mon destin entre vos mains il appartient au mektoub!

Capuche noire, j'attends l'enterrement du Soleil
J'observe ces √¢mes qui errent hors du Jardin d‚Äô√âden

Parfois je pense vraiment que l'humain n'a pas d'√¢me

Des m√©decins l√©gistes font l'amour aux cadavres
Et je pense √† tous ces squats o√π les cam√©s s'entassent
O√π ils partagent le DAS' mais pas une dose de crack
De la r√©alit√© pour r√™veurs sous morphine
Assomm√©s par des anti-douleurs pour nous maintenir en vie
Nos parents tous exploit√©s, us√©s et vid√©s
Le cerveau rempli de conneries par leurs journaux t√©l√©vis√©s
Peu d'exemples autour de nous, tr√®s peu de gens √† citer
Ils veulent qu'on se tire dessus, qu'on fume du shit, qu'on ait pas d'id√©es
Que nos s≈ìurs soient perdues, mat√©rialistes et v√©nales
Qu'elles aient pas le go√ªt de l'ind√©pendance, mais celui du Panamera
Dans mon zoo c'est l'usine, c'est dur de rester lucide
J'ai vu des schlags taper de la c√®√ß m√™me avec une sinusite
J'attends l'Ant√©christ dans cette crise √©cologique
Un bunker atomique pour la guerre bact√©riologique
Je cogite, je m'agite avant de devenir une machine
Je me mutile. √áa vient de Russie, ma kalash crache des classiques
Je suis cet √™tre en argile, qui file droit vers l'asile
Et je cherche la branche de la r√©ussite sur un arbre au million de racines
En tutoyant la mort, je me suis senti vivant
En faisant du mal, on se sent si puissants
Entre r√™ves et cauchemars si hallucinants
Mes textes respirent la rue. J'ai des poumons en ciment
Je suis pas de ceux qui votent. Rien √† foutre du scrutin
Je suis de ceux qui rappent, et je suis Rapublicain!",Rapublicain

Tes r√™ves seront mes r√™ves. Je veux que t'√©crives notre BO
T'es Trinity, je suis Neo. Ti amo, te quiero!

Si l'amour est un gratte-ciel, je veux qu'on vive au dernier √©tage
Touche mon c≈ìur, il s'emballe. Prends ma main, on s'envole
Les gens bavent, les gens parlent, mais, tu sais, moi je m'en cogne
Car moi je me battrai m√™me quand notre couple est en sang
Si nos disputes prennent feu, t'inqui√®te on rena√Ætra de nos cendres
Et tout ne sera pas rose, je veux pas que la vie nous escroque
T'es mon million d‚Äô√©meraudes cach√© dans le fond d'un puits de p√©trole
Je suis pas le gendre id√©al, je poss√®de un pass√© trouble
Peu importe les √©preuves, faut que ta m√®re nous approuve
Et je dis stop, faut aussi que ton p√®re m'aime
Leur manquer de respect, tu sais, je pourrai jamais me permettre
Pour te d√©clarer ma flamme, pas besoin de la plume de Verlaine
Je t'ai aim√© en une seconde, je veux que notre couple soit √©ternel

Plein d'amis √† bois d'Arcy

De toute fa√ßon on va tous crever

Les vraies t√™tes de r√©seaux ne sont pas aux pieds des HLM
Mani√© d'une main d'acier, dans un gant de soie
Chez nous ils mettent des pansements sur des jambes de bois
Chez nous ils prennent des voix, et nous rendent sourds et muets
Au dessus des lois, mais nos lois sont bien plus cruelles
Bloqu√©s dans nos ruelles, o√π la chance ne passe pas
On voit jamais le bout du tunnel, on recule √† chaque pas

Je laisse passer les gens, tout le monde est stress√©

Non non non, je vous ai dit de me laisser
J'ai pas chang√© mais je vous promets que j'essaie
Je laisse passer les gens, tout le monde est stress√©
Chacun se bat pour obtenir sa liberta

Et dans le noir, ils nous balad√®rent, les d√©mocrates totalitaires
La moindre √©tincelle de r√©volte, g√©r√©e par des canadairs
Moi j'analyse, et ne crois pas aux m√©faits du cannabis
Mais l√©galiser, c'est s'asseoir sur une grosse part de b√©n√©fice
Affaires approximatives, saisies obscures
Le procureur salive, triste posture
Tu seras toujours perdant quoi qu'il arrive
Plus de proc√©dures pleines de vices, que de vices de proc√©dure
Et j'aimerais mettre pause
Arracher la m√®che avant que tout explose
J'aimerais m'envoler, √™tre une libellule
En forme de clef, je viendrais ouvrir ta cellule

Non non non, il est temps de me laisser

Dieser Junge, der nach drau√üen auf die Stra√üe muss
Um etwas Geld zu verdie'n, f√ºr den SL, den er sieht
Wenn er bei anderen den Wagen putzt
Er nahm seine Probleme mit, von Stadt zu Stadt
Er will sich gern' behehmen, doch das Leben macht ihn abgefuckt
Keiner hilft, deshalb schei√üt er auf Vater Staat
Warum kann es heute nicht mehr sein, wie es damals war?
Er w√ºrde gerne, wie fr√ºher durch die Stra√üen fahrn'

Schon fr√ºher war ich eigentlich der Klassenclown
Um zu leben, musste ich braune Scheine aus den Kassen klaun'
Alles down, dieser Beat hier fickt die Stimmung
Ich bin braun, wie deine politische Gesinnung

Ich bin braun, wie mein Iftar, Adana Kebap
Braun, der Stoff vom Albaner im Park
Hiba-Ash, wenn der Krip sieht meinen Namen im Pass
√úberall, es ist kalt, wenn die Wichser dich holn'
SadiQ, Mo, ich spuck auf die Richter, Kripo
Der, der tickt f√ºr sein Brot
Ern√§hrt von der Stra√üe, nur
Braun, wie Mo-Dirty-Shits Embryo-Nabelschnur
Ein Traum ist wieder geplatzt
Mach' mich frei von den Sorgen, Kitama Hash
Denn das Geld von dem Tijara Schnapp
Man verbrennt wie das Al Fakher Shishatabak
Braun die Probe, eine Ecke vom Nouga Dope
Braun,  Getr√§nk,man ich ex' nur die Coca Co'
Alles braun um sich selbst
Dunkel Braun, meine Augen, braun, meine Welt

Foul air? Do you care? Is cleanness where you live going against your common believe
Too much slime, insufficient time? In a suffocated future will you find the time to breathe

It's not your death developing your fear
Deteriorating state, hope is lost
Your greed for life is beyond the cost
Hoping for advancement, an invention, a cure
Because of your disease your intentions are unpure
Corrupted by moral values
Spoiled by common wealth
In your race for fortune
You forgot to regard your health
Self pity; shame to blame.

Cellular osmosis, frozen to paralysis
Suspending the result of the ultimate nemesis
Essence drained, exchanged for synthetics
Drastic measures to alter genetics

Robbing yourself of death, what did you expect to gain?

Cannot see what caused your fall
Lying dormant, your seed of faith
Has grown into a nasty vine

Delaying natural death, for a fear of what's beyond
Afraid to take that final step, to the place where you belong

Memory is a blur in a scenario of time
Details are exposed, but remain ignored
Things that are real, are found in a dream
The way in which to see things is not what it seems
Looking for answers, in a mirror that is blank
Images overlap

Within focus of concentration
Abstract input disrupting aim
Course of option appears the same

Only a sudden random chance
When reasons defy reality

Victimized by the Id

As past and future become one
Though the tide retreats, perpetually from the shore
It always returns itself

As it has before

He managed to tear himself away
The past few nights had left him rather tired
Returned his thoughts
To a need he felt overpowering
He felt success was now within his grasp

Three runs forward, two runs back
Climbing the ladder
Trying to stay on just the right track
Keeps up the pace
Tells himself that it's all worthwhile
Hard work is its own reward one day
Could he be wrong
Are all his dreams merely fantasies
And would it all fall in on him some day
Climbing the ladder
Three runs forward, two runs back
Climbing the ladder
Trying to stay on just the right track
Now he sits back
Amid all the things he worked so hard for
And wonders was his energy well spent
Whatever the price
He is where he wants to be
The end has justified the means and all

To get their heart's desire

To do everything just right,
If things were not planned and all done by hand
He would ready himself for a fight
One afternoon while sitting alone
He came to a great realization
When it's his turn to die
Will there be enough time for plenty of planned preparation
With a few minutes thought his decision was clear
A fate most perfectly neat
Not a friend could remain to witness his death
So a terminal wine he would treat.
The plan was to hold a very large feast
Serving the wine at the end
Joining the fun would be everyone
He'd been calling his friend
Invitations went out, all guests did arrive,
The meal looked a great success,
Deciding the time he brought out the wine,
Up stood a familiar guest.

Dashing past

With a laugh

Felt safe from everyone

Look through the curtains cause he was so scared

A fire burning down the block
He saw their faces, but they looked so mad
Whatever happened he knew it was bad
He was so alone in there

No one understands

Said they'd be home, but they weren't there

I want to hold you but if I hold you

Why does it scare me so to look into your eyes
Where will you go, what will you do
Who will you meet, what will become of you?
Your mother won't see you she's far too afraid
And I don't have the money to keep you today
Maybe someday our paths will cross
It's better this way, good-bye and good luck

a) The Cross (Home #3)

The boy is here, he won't say much
I don't know why
One thing is clear, we know he's had a troubled life
You are not who I had in mind
I don't know where I belong, but I'm sure that it's not here
Is he just shy, what do you think he's got to hide
Maybe in time, we'll find out what's behind those eyes
I don't think that you understand
All I want is to find out who I am
Father, when will I get my cross?
When will I get my cross?
I don't know how,
I wonder what would make him smile
Look at him now, he stares at me like I'm on trial
I need to know is he still alive
And if so, is my mother still his wife?
He's just a child, he's got time to start again
Give him a while
The boy just needs a friend
Father, when will I get my cross?
When will I get my cross?

A horizon

Saga,"Listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there, not like you

Ignorant siblings in the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy, spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see

But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one
Who illuminated your little piece of the divine?

And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely
On your way your way home

Oh, what are they going to do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
You were the light and the way they'll only read about
I only pray, Heaven knows when to lift you out
10, 000 days in the fire is long enough, you're going home

You're the only one who can hold your head up high
Shake your fists at the gates saying, ""I've come home now
Fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended, it's time now
My time now, give me my, give me my wings""

You are the light and way that they will only read about

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
(With the)
Burden of proof tossed upon the believers
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence
Judith Marie, unconditional one

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion but
Should you see your Maker's face tonight
Look Him in the eye, look Him in the eye and tell Him
""I never lived a lie, never took a life but surely saved one
Hallelujah, it's time for You to bring me home""

It's time to rethink every fact that is imaginable
Survival instinct dwells in a past that is inhabitable
I happen to pull fast ones over the slow parole board
Who likes to speak to de-fanged wolves who cry sheep
Time seeps into our skin, age indicates how long we've been lost in space
I keep putting expression looks upon my face
An awful waste of human skin who waits for Autumn to begin
While far from grace, will do me in to late
(I'm out of seasoning)
No spring chickens, summer romance novel writer could win a prize
It's Nobel, go to hell in a riding vehicle that he winterized
I change my mind more often then my undergarments
Abide abortion and other nonsense
I'm an orphan who comes from Providence
I am assigned from God! For the parentally misguided

(And I know...)
State is not an ocean, not an island, not a road

How many images of missing kids can be fit onto a milk carton?
Framed, they're starting to look the same
Starting to say his name, and claim privileges
As if they found HIM!
The strangest little kids surrounding the circle of false friendship
Rings of fire are connected at the elbow
Cause they're tired, moms unexpectedly let go
The Velcro light component that keeps there unit cohesive
It's the music! So we give reasons to get sober
Life experiences to hum to
These kids play Red Rover? I look for weaknesses to run through
With reckless abandon, they're standin', refuse to go down
The pinballs in their machine bounce between abusive homes now
If its fighter flats, they'll just choose to throw down
Ain't nothing like beating a dead horse, riding it through a ghost town
I move with no sound... I used to think I was invisible
Til they stopped me in mid-stride and said
""I think I seen a picture of you...""
Picture that, I said ""Nah I just got one of them faces
Placed next to an expiration date that changes.
I kind of look familiar, my name is at the tip of your tongue
The lost look on my face makes you play dumb.
Say something collopial
I need to get my bearings and a feel for where I'm at
but you ain't hearin' that.""
They shout freeze! I'm a tourist trapped by townies
Who put bounties on armies and all surrounding counties
Before I bounce, I hear them shout
""Someone help us out, PLEASE!""
We're all alone in the foster home
Killin' ourselves with the house keys...
Not every broken home can come equipped with a fix-it man
And it's a smelly mess once the shit hits the fan
Kids just stand in their circle jerks with there dicks in the sand
Saying ""FUCK THE WORLD"" cause they ain't got no girl
But who do they think I am?
Think again, I'm not that quick to plan ahead of time
I'm two steps behind the schedule, they pretend to befriend my mind
I think they just misread the lines in the palm of my hand
Cause, they're random scars caused by slap boxin' with landlords
I ran with the dogs till I realized they were all mutts
Turned bitch once the dog catcher caught up
Forced into trucks, boarded up, put to sleep in the pound
Being an orphan sucks, but I'm done with sneaking around
I see my frown posted up on street lights
And telephone poles, from what they show it seems like
I never grow old, from what they show it seems like
I never go home, and that doesn't seem right
Cause they won't let me grow...

And this is where some go
to avoid the sunrays and the noise of subways

And the petty criticisms from those who ain't accomplished

After years of pullin' rabbit ears out my pants pockets
I'm not revealing any tricks of the trade

In an effort to make them more secret I find in my life I decided to give them a look
Now I'm givin' them a glimpse and I guess I'm sittin' in the middle of an unread book
Letters are falling apart but the sentencess end and run of the wording is permanent
Never been missed
Suckers been missed
What did you miss
Interpreted is
Funny I'm serving the sentence of solitary confinement
Results in a death sentence and still I'm a running assignment
I'm just wondering where my time went
It pulled a disappearing act
And every single assistant I ever had got stored in half

Cause see I never payed attention but I can't afford to laugh (word?)
Cause I'm lookin' through my book
And an autograph from my cats (Ok)
And I'm short on staff
So all I ask is volunteers from the crowd
Show a little bit of audience participation now!
When I say hip (what do I say)
You, you say shut the fuck up we ain't sayin' shit
And I'll respect it (yes!)
Check it
In a flair for the dramatic exit
A fashoinable entrance late to my own arraignment
(Oh) The self-destructive things that I do for entertainment
My folks gave me this art
You're broken heart is my pallet
While I was out honin' my craft
You were disownin' your talent
Cause while you still live at home
And I bought this house off my parents (uhh)
I'm gettin' ahead of myself (I'm gettin' ahead of myself)
I see the hair on my back (I see the hair on my back)
I'm On the Road reading Kerouac
His poems versus better raps
I think to myself (I think to myself)
What's worth remembering
Versus defending
The size of my manhood
Or confessional canned goods

In an effort to make them more secret I find in my life I decided to give them a look
Now I'm givin' them a glimpse and I guess I'm sittin' in the middle of an unread book
Letters are falling apart but the sentencess end and run of the wording is permanent
Never been missed
Suckers been missed
What did you miss
Interpreted is
But none of this is gettin' told in confidence I reckon
I spin confidential records just to hold the listeners attention

I'm a veteran of spacial relationships
I clip your wings to fit you in
Headshrinking magician
Shapeshifting reptilian
Turned body contortionist
Orphanages started offering tortures to abortion clinics (abortion clinics)
I lost aquantances
And a morgue of lady friends
I gender bent the heaven sent angelic devil boy
Good Gods adrogenous
I'm lookin' marvelous
But looks can kill
And they're unsure about my sexual orientation still
Put me in a special kind of case that only breaks if
You hit it with a bouqet of flowers and baby breath arrangement
The vault is vacant
And they're all looking for phone call blame
I called my agent
The moment that I caught the train
I let him know that I'm goin' nowhere
He's invited
If he leaves tonight then he might just help me find it
But this is my burden to bear
Not his
And I'm a psychic without a sidekick
Holding the future hostage
A loose cannon standing on the rooftop with
A new respect and understanding of bartenders and locksmiths
They call me daredevil
But I'm not precise enough
Unprofessional
On an amateur level
I love my life too much

The force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down on
The song in the air
Was fritting her care
With singer can be among song

(Sage Francis)
Ma, ma look what I did ma
Look what I did to my hands
I broke 'em
You gave me the stone, gave me the chisel
Didn't say how to hold 'em
Didn't say give away every piece of the puzzle
Till I was left with nothin'
But I took it upon myself to crush it up and distribute the dust
Get in the bus, hop in the van
Jump in the water, crawl to the land
Build another castle out of the sand
Break it down and then I get into the saddle again
Gone city to city
I'm already lost to the boss
Who is new in town
I'ma ride this horse till it bucks me off
And I'm forced to shoot it down
I'ma take him out for some gasoline
I'ma trade this cow for some magic beans
Make mom proud of the deals that I've made
Cause I'm just a modern day Johnny Appleseed
But I'm glad that I never passed the gins
And I never put down the axe
Piano man got checkered dance floor
The grace and the painful look on his face
Cause the crowd is packed
And the louder they clapped
The less he is able to make the connection
Between what he sees when he hears certain notes
And the hurt that is shown in his facial expression
I don't need your 'go-ahead' to go ahead
y'all don't know if sales gon' be-easy
But sweet Jesus who wants to sleep with me
Way to many moves to learn
But not enough people to put 'em on
Look it mom
No hands
I built a suit of armor with wooden arms

Sage Francis,"I just sit there and let the thoughts flood
And I remind myself it's all right, it's all good, it's all love
It's not though 'cause there's a kink in the armor
A pothole I'm sinking in while I think of the drama

So I stand up, start to pace in my living room
Set my eye to the highway knowing that I'll play chicken soon
There's a vanity plate with my name on it
There's a Davey Crockett hat with a Masonic fat cat under it

A musket rifle spitting at my feet
They want me to dance in the middle of the street
And I respect my elders, so I do as I'm told
But I offset the bell curve when I do it with soul, losing control

Guilty feet do have rhythm, they just dance to
The wrong theme music to amuse the villain
Instead of killing, I'll spare the raccoon
And start filling sandbags as I stare at the moon
And let the thoughts flood

Blessed are those who are dammed when the levee broke
How many choked on the steps to a slow dance?
A staircase to a hug with no hands
Accountability hung out to dry on the line of command

We let the thoughts flood
We remind ourselves it's all right, it's all good, it's all love
It's not though 'cause there's a kink in the armor
A pothole I'm sinking in

Sharing a drink with my father
It's a family affair, the vanity we share
The waterline is rising, all we do is stand there

Sage Francis,"The sun flies through the sky leaves darkness in it's wake 
And now I hear the hell hounds barking at the gate
To be honest sometimes I want you to relate
This ain't up for discussion it's not a topic for debate
Entrepreneurs that want to bottle up the hate 
And slap a label on the glass so hard that it'll break
And if you break it you buy it and we sold it by the case
It's OK if you just try it you can hold it to your face

How close can you get without touching it
How far removed can you get from the public
Can you keep a secret?
If not, can you tie a slipknot?
Can you stand high up on this brick block?
Listen to the clock tick tock and switch gears
It's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 years

Are they all dancing now? Are you joining the party? 
Are just celebrating your life just by destroying your body?
It's a part of your psyche that I want to sight see 
I don't need you as a tour guide and I don't want you to like me
I was voted least likely
That's it just least likely 
So pardon me if I seem feisty 
Bite my tongue like a bullet take a pull from the peace pipe 
Push past the low expectations of me each night

I leave light in my wake and I moonwalk across the floor 
Until I hear the sex kittens all purring at the door
There's something outside that we all want 
But inside there's an ex who marks a soft spot
Till it rots and decays and then no one else cares 
It's been 7 8 9 10 11 12 years

Now I sell pennies to the well-wishers 
I fish through the coin slots 
I fall through a girls bait participate in boycotts 
I demonstrate a demon's trade
With a face void of thoughts 
If that don't launch a thousand ships
Than that's a Helen of Troy's loss
There's nothing in this horse
It's hollow it's empty it's entry will not be forced
Like an eye socket stripped clean of tears

Sage Francis,"I got nothing to teach the learnin' curve of your body 
I got teeth that could hurt you prolly
With one bite
A tongue with spikes, a rusty knife 
I wish you'd take it from me
An gut me like a fish. up tight and selfish
Got a lust for life and a death wish
They're husband and wife and they
Fuck like they're helpless 
Am I a product of uninteresting sex
If I'm bored by your pillow-talk and Newport cigarettes?
She chews on fiberglass like a teething infant
He breathes in her stink and seems indifferent
She dreams of children
He hears the pitter-patter of little fetuses
He's like ""stand by me,
There's a leech in my briefs and it's bleeding like a stuck pig
Come quick!""
Think of a baby's name, she wanted to call it Quits
I'm a name him Raymond and raise him
Like I don't know my own strength
And bench-press the baby naked

Manhandle the kill switch
Peg meet square, get dismantled by drill-bits
The deconstruction of a functional addict
Leaving assumptions to a bunch of fanatics
It's just standard procedure
With a automatic pilot light
Hide behind a white lab rain coat 'cause the water broke
Press eject
First comes the head, then the neck
Then the body avalanches out the tape deck
Flappin' on the ground like a fish out of its element
No one wants to acknowledge the carnage, the mess or elephant
That's in the room
Connected to the womb with a lifeline
Labored all day through the morning noon and nighttime
Then we cut the cord, fully aware
What we keep on the inside's too personal to share
Now we hold it in the air, like ""look what happened!""
If we throw it out with the bath water
Will you catch it?
Or let it go down the drain
If it goes down the drain I'm a snatch it

Sage Francis,"It's been a long and lonely trip 
But I'm glad that I took it because it was well worth it.
I got to read a couple books 
And do some research before I reached my verdict.
Never thought that I was perfect.
Always thought that I had a purpose.
Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.

The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service
Realizing the person I was addressing 
Probably wasn't looking down from heaven.
Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen trying to listen in 
Or eaves drop from some another dimension
It was self serving just like this is.

Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.
The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.
Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance
Til we just stayed distant and never touched.
Now all we do is text too much.

I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.
Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.
Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade 
But I didn't have the courage to talk to her.
In 8th grade I wrote her the note
But I slipped it in someone else's locker.

Considered killing myself 'cause of that.
It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.
It was over for me. My goose was cooked.
Stick a fork it me. The jig is up.
I blew my chances the rest is history
Our future was torn asunder.
It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.

At least I didn't include my name.
Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code
And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.
Plus it was set to self destruct.
Whoever read it probably died laughing.
I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.

A year later I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.
I had someone else to obsess over.
I was older. I was very mature.
I forged my time signature 
While practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.
Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.

I checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road.
Steamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode.
If you snoop around long enough 
For something in particular you're guaranteed to find it.
For better or worse that's how I learned 
That it's best to just keep some things private.
It was the best of times. It was the end of times.

It was the best of times. It was the end of times.
I was always on deck I was next in line.
An only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that I could never have.
The walls in my house were paper thin.

Every squabble seemed to get deafening.
If my memory serves me correctly 
I made it a point to void and forget some things.
Probably to keep from being embarrassed.
Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents.

Kept my secrets hid my talents 
In my head never under the mattress

Therapy couldn't break me.
Never learned a word that would insure safety.
So I spoke softly and I tip toed often.
The door to my room was like a big old coffin.
The way that it creeked when I closed it shut.
Anxieties peaked when it opened up.
As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed.
I still sleep fully clothed.
It was the best of times. 
It was the end of times.

It was beautiful.
It was brutal.
It was cruel.
It was business as usual.

Heaven. 
It was hell.
Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12.

When I did I figured that I was immortal.
Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal.
Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend
Bust a move with any other dudes.

Tone Loc was talking bout a ""Wild Thang""
But I was still caught up in some child thangs.
Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod.
It was clearly a brimstone and fire thang.

Pyromaniac. 
Kleptomaniac.
Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire.
Now I add it to my rider.
Like ""Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!""
It was the best of times. It was the end of times.

The school counselor was clueless 'cause I never skipped classes.
Perfect attendance. Imperfect accent.
Speech impediment they could never really fix
And I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses.

Considered doing something that would cripple me.
I wanted a wheelchair. I wanted the sympathy.
I wanted straight teeth so then came braces.
4 years of head gear helped me change faces.
It was the best of times. 
It was the end of times.

Now I wonder if I'll live to see marriage.
Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids.
Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids.
If I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is.

""Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years.
Don't let anybody protect your ears.
It's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear.
It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers.
Beer won't give you chest hair. Spicy food won't make it curl.
When you think you've got it all figured out and then your universe collapses

I was zero when I came out my momma, and now everybody knows.

In the before life, I was undead.
I was home schooled, there were no rules.
But I gave it all up, just for the chance to go public.
A celestial scarecrow dancing with the puppets.
A tug in my gut, I'm carrying the world in my stomach.
I'm a surrogate mother-fucker the girls love it.
Birth the suffix and cut the visible string.
Controls much more than a physical thing.
I was born into it, and before I knew it.
I saw the students of poor gettin' hauled off to war.
The law of Judas in the land of the king's tax.
Partaking the Eucharist, than demand your kick-backs.
Spiritual wrist slap, please pass the sacrament.
Ask if big bad black Jesus was African.
Selling a click track, call it a soul-plat.
It's all in how you package it.
The power of a magic trick.
Immaculate concepts, lost in the land of the cross.
I'm standing off with a man of the cloth.
He knows the ins and out's and all I wants the outs.
Hes selling real estate for some place in the clouds.
But I'm not investing in intellectual property.
Inventing gender-bending technology.
Because maybe everybody needs to just become a sexual oddity.
Leaving birth to the test tubes and death to the lottery.
There's no one stopping me, I've gotta be self-regulating.
Wealth was escalating, but my poverty was entertaining.
I'm debating, the value of a caste system.
I'm cash backed for wars and wars funded by my tax income.
I find my part of the problem in part of me.
There's always been a difference between what I am and what I wanna be.

It's either Jihadist freak or Jesus seamster.
I heard god is cumming and shes a screamer.

I couldn't understand what she was telling me.
Why everyone thinks that their their own worst enemy.
I followed the manual and I swallowed the skeleton key.
And it unlocked the hell in me.

Prosity and needing to be lectured to a meet up
The student becomes the teacher, the son becomes a parent
From a scab to teamster, the sun becomes apparent
From a chemical imbalance to a litany of habits
And this is not a love ballad

You should drown me in that womanhood and teach me how to swim
Beat me with my own hands and tie down my limbs
Suffer for my sins or let me suffer from within
But in the end this is not a love ballad
We can battle with tattoos to cover up the bruises
The first to show any sign of discomfort loses
For the first time in a long time you‚Äôre not who my muse is
And this is not a love ballad
I‚Äôm not thirsty, I just got hungry eyes, you look appetizing
And from a distant stare broken eye contact in disrepair
Sometimes I disappear, but now you see me
A part Irish goodbye, other part Harry Houdini
Put my feet to the fire, I got Satan on my heels
If it‚Äôs all about prestige, just wait for the reveal
I got a new bag of tricks to turn, a new black magic woman bitch to burn
So much for live and learn

Patience is a virtue, virtue is a grace
Grace is a little girl who wouldn‚Äôt wash her face
Grace is a virtue, virtue is a mean
Between two extremes, one of excess, one of deficiencies
Patience is a virtue, virtue is a dirty stain
Cleanliness is next to godliness and isn‚Äôt worth the pain
Grace is a virtue, virtue of the pageant
And this is not a love ballad

Is a music box that haunts me from the top-shelf of the bedroom closet
I don‚Äôt touch it, it just cuddles with my conscience
I‚Äôm on constant guard, jittery the whole night
Clinging the sheets because it sings to me slow like
And that‚Äôs her song running through an hourglass
Built with two wine bottles that I found in a flower patch
Planting it in quicksand, refusing to sink fast
Abusing me slow, I hear the music and I think back
Before the fall, before the set up
Before the interest in sex even developed
I fell in love with distance as an ex‚Äôs best friend
There used to be revenge, but i couldn‚Äôt see no end
So I had to switch the lens in and focus on some flesh
No more clinging to old threads",Grace
Sage Francis,"You gave me language as a gift, I turned it against you
I was stupid, I was young, I was hanged by my Judas tongue
You shouldn‚Äôt give weapons to kids that don‚Äôt know better
I can't possibly understand that there‚Äôs no such thing as forever
For every letter in the alphabet
You said connect ‚Äòem to a happy word, no matter how bad things get
I did my best, but the pickings got slim
Once I arrived at ‚ÄúX‚Äù and I had to think of synonyms
Weight ‚Äòem against the antonyms, I was hanging with all the mannequins
Who are on a constant search for a person‚Äôs amputated limbs
Almost offered up my own, trading in my arms and legs
You said learn to express yourself if you‚Äôre gonna stand for things
I stood up with that expression, stood up against everything including you
I was stupid, I was adolescent, but I had your lessons to cling on to
And I want you to know how much it helped
Considering everything that I‚Äôd gone through
It was a period without periods, run on sentences were like binges
I was a comma with no cause, a rebel with no clause
Anxiety is no excuse once there‚Äôs nothing left to separate
We could have connected, but didn‚Äôt
I was ignorant, passed out on the spacebar
The further we drifted apart the closer
I came to realizing just how amazing you are
Now that you‚Äôre gone I'mma say it to the stars
‚ÄòTill my words knock worlds off their axes and the universe collapses

Thank you for the matches, for the gift of fire
For the wood and the axe, for whooping my ass
For the wheel even if you didn‚Äôt invent it
For the impact that you had on me, it‚Äôs epic, thank you for the effort
For teaching me the ABC‚Äôs even if I never make my way to ‚ÄúZ‚Äù
Even if I never do for someone else exactly what you did for me
Thank you

I was a stupid son of a gun with initials carved into me
I was a stray, a runaway, afraid someday you‚Äôd shoot me
So I scratched off the letters with a pocket knife
It‚Äôs how I loss my way when I was tossed into the fray
This is not my life, who am I kidding, it's a thank you note
Disguised as a written apology for everything you taught to me
So awkwardly I approach the open microphone with everything that I wrote
Clear my throat, adjust the collar on my coat
As I rock crowds, microphones and boats and then I stroke
Whatever little ego I have left, I should have left it at the alter
But I didn‚Äôt cause I‚Äôm an idiot, self-deprecating author
With a paperback edition that isn‚Äôt worth a flip through
If I don‚Äôt give you the credit that you deserve
You edited the words from the grave and beyond
From the first sign of sun raise at dawn
Till the moonbeam set blaze to my lawn
The universe collapses on my front steps
So we get to share in that moment, for just one moment
And nobody‚Äôs upset, there‚Äôs no more anger, there‚Äôs no more sunsets
So I crawl back in the chamber, you can shoot me up
You might as well, we had great communication before the tower fell

Thank you for the matches, for the gift of fire
For the wood and the axe, for whooping my ass
For the wheel even if you didn‚Äôt invent it
For the impact that you had on me, it‚Äôs epic, thank you for the effort
For teaching me the ABC‚Äôs even if I never make my way to ‚ÄúZ‚Äù
Even if I never do for someone else exactly what you did for me
Thank you

I'mma do my best, while you rest in peace",Thank You

Sahara Hotnights,"He was the satisfied employee 
Lots of so hard work and no salary
The quickly thrown out Christmas tree
What about all the loving and the sympathy
You're just a disappointed little birthday child
Although your presents didn't please you
And you start to cry
And tonight, what are you going to do tonight?

[Chorus]
Drive dead slow cause the road is slippy
Drive dead slow cause it's still slippy
Keep it so low tonight

She's the comedian queen with a cruel joke
A false alarm and a poisoned coke
The relentless killer without regrets
And none of us phone to say, what a threat
She wheels you out, 
She'll leave you there
When it starts to blow, 
She'll come and she'll go
And tonight, what are you going to do tonight?

Oh so far away from home
I know exactly what to do

Watch him go down and down
And when we are first in line
And when we are satisfied
It's just a goodbye

And we are struggling to make sense
Somehow we shocked the underworld
Looking for a house yeah
Looking for a place where no-one can hurt us
Looking like strangers

But you would set free in daylight
And I take off with small thin broke legs
I held you close

One reason to be here when you wake up
Fingers numb and my eyes so hollow
But hey you can try to talk me out of giving up

If I'd do it all over
Wouldn't throw it all away
'Cause it's taking us nowhere
And you're finally free from the spell you can't see

I'm asking, do you know why people stay on
You won't get far with your good attention
We won't get far and you're better off on your own

I say it will pass you say this time it's never ending

I say the solution might be closer than it seems

I know you got reasons for shutting me out
You say it's so bad that the bad is all you can depend on
It won't come easy and it won't come good
But I can be patient
I tell you next day is better ending

And I swore I could see right through your empty heart
I know you can't take it anymore
And I thought I could fill it but I'm back at the start
You know I can't help you anymore

Look, if I don't hurt the nigga that play with my wealth
I'm like me on Entourage god, I'm playing myself, let's go

[Chorus]
Hold up, the pump will make you jump up
Put ya body in the trunk 
(Don't you baby, don't you baby, don't ya baby)
Keep goin' now
New York, and all the way to Cali
And the South'll make ya jump 
(Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby)
Don't touch the boy, yup
Hold up, the pump will make ya jump up
Put ya body in the trunk 
(Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby)
I'll whip ya ass from
New York, and all the way to Cali
And the South'll make ya jump 
One two three we gone!

You ain't crazy, don't you play me, don't you know its Jay-Z 
When internet ask you who's the best, why wont you say me?
Don't you hate me, c'mon baby, was it all gravy 
I took my lumps comin' up just like a boxer baby 
My first style may be if I stutter, maybe 
But then I slowed it down brought it from the gutter baby 
Matterfact, I don't give a fuck what you rate me 
Record labels told me, guess what the fuck that make me 
Super rich, stupid bitches know I'm super viscous 
Like standin' over a wounded man with two biscuits 
Lets get it clear like eucalyptus if you conflicted 
My flow is like the Cuban missile crisis 
Nigga my hand missiles is priceless, 
I hide a couple rare jewels in a verse 
For my niggas that like to listen like this 
Gotta let it do what it do baby

[Chorus]

Four finger, three finger, two finger, one finger
Hum dinger, gun slinger, that's what I am
Trying to get some cash in my hand as fast as I can
So you should, come on baby, come on, come on and fuck wit' ya man
I got this rap shit down to a science
Alotta niggas shit is aight but they ain't fucking with Ryan
First there was some defiance, until I formed an alliance
With Justin, he plugged me in, now I'm as hot as a fucking iron
You lying, all the gunplay talk
Knowing behind closed doors you be practicing on ya runway walk
I been in the kill, been in the cap, been in the box and back
I been in the 'ville, tripping the gat, trimming a boxing match
And I still walk around this fucker with not a scratch
And that's way more then I can say for a lot of cats
My name's Saigon nigga
Break bread mu'fucka' 'fore I break ya fucking head lil' sucka'

You wanna go to war bop 
You wanna hear the 44 pop 
You wanna see the gun that will make more than just your jaw drop 
You wanna mess with the best, 
But do you want to save your mama some stress 
Nigga if you really want to test 
I'll come and chop you in half 
My click is cucku for cocoa they'll pop you and laugh 
Wanna do gun play, Monday through Sunday 
All 52 weeks of the year 
Am I speaking clear? 
You feel my flow 
Even though I'm so political 
Ain't another MC as gangsta as me 
Shit I should be signed to Death Row 
Uh-oh there go Saiyo 
AK nine six at yo 5-0 
Mind blow to your spinal 
You're only a thug on vinyl 
You soft, I know 
And yo so is your rhyme flow 
I'm the only rapper to ever shoot up the club 
Me and my man Sean Paul 
I pop up in a hot car 
You hop up in the cop car 
Then start telling the cops who's selling the rocks 
And who the niggas on the block are 

(Chorus) 
I put's it down 
I know they like the way my shit sounds 
Banging from the hood out to the hick towns 
Everything I spit is hit bound 
They on my shit now 

Gotta get that money like Krazie, Lazie and Bizzy bone 
Trying to take my from me 
What kind of crazy shit is you on? 
Let a kid act funny I'll lace him like when my kicks is on 
We in the zone 
We don't go to war with no sticks and stones 
Wanna play Gin Rummy then shuffle the cards and deal 'em out 
But if you get picked up then we trust that you not going to sqeal us out 
I'm in the cut with a chick with a bigga but than Trina 
And a better face than Jigga's slut 
Nigga I'm Saigon you understand that? 
I'm draped in firearms, you wanna wear that? 
If you was now you not 
You done fucked with the wrong one now you shot 
I'll even give it to a cop mother fucker 
You the chump I'm not mother fucker

That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said, 'Yes'
'N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
'N I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, 'Yes'

The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' into her eyes
And when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said, 'Yes'
'N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
'N I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, 'Yes'

So I called the preacher, family, and friends
And nothin's been the same since

Tell them they full of shittin' they'll tell ya you insecure 
Callin' ya immature does that make sense to y'all? 
You ever feel like it's you against the whole world? 
Like everybody is scheming even your own girl 
Your home boys seem to be counting your money 
Tell 'em you ain't got it 'n' he lookin' at you funny 
I'm feeling like I probably need ta either leave the game alone 
Or either be the cheater bang the chrome 'n' get his name known

But if I tell ya 
Then I gotta kill ya

It's ill like a vet that's still wet behind the ear 
Some niggas look hard 
But I don't feel a threat behind the stares
I'm looking for Vics

How dare somebody jump out the window to try an' stop me 
I wait for niggas then shoot 'em like I was a paparazzi

I jump out the back and turn ya block into Nagasaki

If we could just get it right, oh, oh
Then everything should be OK, OK

Do away with the club and the drug spots
Do away with the judge and the mug shots
Like we do away with the day when the sun drops
Clap your hands if you're tired of hearing gunshots
Or hear news about who got popped
By another black man or knocking a white cop
If I ain't there when they start the fight stop like ah
Slow your roller or be cold as a ice pop ya
We gotta start helping each other quit hurting each other
Money you will have a nigger thinking 'bout merking his mother
How does it feel being slaves to a dollar bill?
Givin' ya something y'all can feel, are ya for real
Do away with all the Chinese restaurants
Do away with all the fakes Gloria Estefans
Clap your hands if you gettin' in some real estate
Buy the crib ma' the Benz with the wheels can wait
I remember I used to instigate
Now I'm the one breaking up the fight
Making sure that detentions straight
Let a nigga get the heart to push me
I'll snuff the biggest nigga with him
Show em that his partner pussy
You ain't gotta be soft to beat the peace
I'm the like the Martin Luther King, then knock out some teeth
Now I'ma flip it and shift it get it prolific 
'Case niggas just get it twisted
Forget that I'm so gifted
Do away with the jails and the group homes
Like we did away with the shells and the two tone
Clap your hands if you love it and just play shit
Cause we don't just make songs, we make statements

We try our best to survive, 
We ain't running away
And keep our heads to the sky,

It's that stress and depression goodbye
Chase all of our troubles away
If we could just get it right, oh, oh

Do away with the hip hop police force,
Fuck the pigs, I was taught not to eat pork
Clap your hands if you ain't forget what you came from
Clap again and you're ready to see the change come
I used to live in the same slum as Mike Tyson and
That's where the knuckle came from
Spring Valley had the same bond
We had to stay in Higherland Lake 'cause we ain't have an income
Now they on the track like when the train come
Now ravages floor jack nigga I be sayin' somethin' 
And with my man Jus' nigga be Blazed 
You're just about to witness history made

It's pretty hard not to go insane,
Not pretty if you don‚Äôt comply,
Pretty easy if you don‚Äôt complain,
Stand there like you don‚Äôt feel pain,
No tears in the face of defeat,
Pretend to the end that you don‚Äôt feel change,
Don‚Äôt admit it that your faith is weak,
Don‚Äôt say that you feel like dying,
Life‚Äôs hard that it feels like diamonds,
Go home, shit's far too gone,
Much too late to even feel like trying,
Can't understand what I‚Äôm saying,
Can't figure out what I‚Äôm implying,

I wanna stop these nightmares,
I just wanna touch your face,

All I see is all my flaws,
All I can hear is all my demons,
Even through your applause,
All you see is all my flights,
All I see is all my falls,
All you see is all my rights,
All I see is all my wrongs,
Go on keep telling me to fight,

Tellin me to put a bullet inside my head,

When ya'll come flood the ghetto with guns, drugs and legalize bottles of
Hurtin' jerkin
My cousin on per percent
He gave out a murder threat
They caught him, shot up his legs and those fuckers ain't working yet
Bloomberg banned cigarettes
Why you in man letting police men beat on niggas yet
Ya'll know that the shit I'm saying is true
Ignoring it if it ain't pertaining to you
But if the (preacher) don't walk it like he talk it
Then dammit, dog on it, that nigga got some explaining to do

You ain't practicing what you preach
Nah you extorting us on the weekend
Rob stealing and running a game
Getting filthy rich in God's name

You ain't practicing what you preach
Nah you extorting us on the weekend
Rob, stealing and running a game
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame

Know what I'm saying, no disrespect to nobody, ya'll motherfuckers
Blaspheming ass ni--a, using the lord's name in vain nigga, don't do that
Shit. That niggas pimping the system, stop pimping the poor people man,

Saigon,"[Chorus]
Whoa, oh
We keep rising to the top
Whoa, oh
And keep eyes out for the cops
Whoa, oh
And that's what it gon' be
Whoa, oh
'Cause you ain't gon' stop me
They got you working two jobs, trying to make ends meet
You just trying to keep your kids off the street
You gotta believe it (Best believe it's a dream)
Oh, you better believe it (You too can achieve)
Uh, oh
They got you locked in a hole, 19 years old
Ten years, no chance for parole
They better believe it (That's right, tell them again)
Oh, you better believe it (After that, tell a friend)
Whoa, oh

After the sunshine come the rain, after the fun time come the pain
I often wonder if it's gonna change
I caught a bad case of Smacking-Bitch-I-Itits (What happened?)
I came home, my wife got my daughter in shitty diapers (Damn)
The rice is still raw and the meat is still frozen in the freezer
I hate that I'm to close to her to leave her
Either I hit the street to do some pitching, knowing these dudes is snitching
Or die trying to make it as a musician
My living condition is not in the greatest condition (Nope)
And nah, I ain't bitching, I just gotta make a decision
Should I breeze past, hop out in a ski mask
Rob everything moving and cruise in a G-Class (Vroom)
But keep writing the heat that the street like it
Youngings is reciting my lyrics, so keep biting
Y'all niggas is thinking shit is easy, it's hard
One thing I know I'm a do is keep believing in God

[Chorus]

After the fast songs come the slow, after the sad songs come some more (More)
This is the life I have come to know
Police is in Marquis', Chevy Caprices stroll
The young, hood boogers idolize Keyshia Cole
The rap figures throwing money in the air like it's pizza dough
People in the hood ain't eating though (Though)
I tried to help the labels see the vision
But they lowered me to a subdivision, you gotta be fucking kidding
They'd rather me pretend to be something I'm not
I'm the new Public Enemy, I'm different than Yung Joc
And nah, I ain't dissing, this nigga's up in the Forbes
Shit, I ain't made a dollar trying to rap for the cause
But in these next four bars, I'll tell you about Maleverly Laws
They enforcing on North American shores
Dog, if they can have rifles on their farms
Then I don't see why they knocked T.I. for trying to bear arms

[Chorus]

Tell them wave at the artist, I feel like I'll make it regardless
Don't forget I'm the ex-con that made it the farthest (Yup)
Until the day that I lay with the martyrs
Or until the day I'm parlaying, playing with my sons and my daughters
I'mma remain the smartest, hardest working nigga in the business
Just Blaze, can I get a witness (Yessir)
See that they probably get it if I come out flop
Get dropped, go back to my block and get shot (Pop)
As they putting my body in that life-size Ziplock
Then you'll be saying ""Damn, Giddy died for this hip-hop""
Or maybe it entail you to get locked
To another 20 in the rock for them to give me my props
Whatever the case may be
We do a census on who is the sickest lyricist, they say me
That's without a album out, y'all rated me
I drop one and I'mma bow out gracefully

Saigon, talk to 'em man
Tell 'em how we tryin' to do this man!

Check, my heart is hurtin' and my soul's searchin' for a better way
I was born in Mooseknuckle where the kid was led astray
Then I moved to B.K., where I fell in love with guns
Fast forward six years later I'm a felon on the run with one
Renegade Run was my alias
And even when I was whylin the 'gon was a Don like Cornelius
Them hoes used to chase me around
None of my niggaz surprised, I got models givin' face to me now
That I roll with a super producer plus keep the booth in a stupor
That's your dog? Call him, or we're meetin' is [?]
I try to put all of my trouble-makin' days behind me
But it seem like them fuckers always find some way to find me
I never thought that Just Blaze would sign me (why?)
Cause he know that I fight a lot and he know my Nation is rangin grimy (yeah)
That's how I know that nigga for real
Took a chance on givin a trill nigga a deal

Niggaz thought by now that I woulda took the magnum to the chest
Or have the staggerin' arrest record for dabblin' in this
I knew I shouldn'ta been in since I'm fresh up out the pen
But N-O spell 'no' sucka, I kill 'em with the flow fucka
You could compare me to no other
I'm so scared of my temper, what if somebody try me?
What if I gotta prove that I still use the shotty?
Atlantic Records would dropped me, police is gon' knock me
Them bitches is gon' laugh at me, the haters is gon' party
And I'll be back in the yard
With old timers callin' me a GODDAMN FOOL for clappin' ratchets at y'all
I'm tellin you this, so you know I'm fully aware
And very mindful, that I will throw away my career
And let one of you little bitch niggaz step in my square
And I'll show you I keep the weapon right here, aiyyo Belly come here!

[Chorus]

Check it, look
I'm hardly never low-key so it's hard to get to know me
Got enemies in the street that's still targetin' to smoke me
It must make 'em sick to see me as godly [?] in the movie
Wait 'til they start spendin' money to market and promote me
Why would y'all wanna stop me?
I changed my life around, put the rifle down, niggaz still plottin' to Big and 'Pac me
But on the contrilly I'm packin' the mac-milly
And clappin at the first lil' faggot that act silly
It was my destiny to be here
I killed the mixtapes for three years, all original beats so be clear
And as fuckin' fate would have it
I got connected with the best producer in the world so we can go in and make a classic
So when will you learn? I get deep without the Biblical terms
We livin' in hell with no physical burn
That's why a nigga tryin to find a better way
And sayin' hi to tomorrow, goodbye to yesterday

My cousin gone from the slum, father was a bum (a bum)
He had a mother but he never felt she loved-ed him (loved-ed him)
People used to speculate was it because of them
That he grew up chewing more than just bubble gum
He used to like to bite his nails, even fight the gal
I used to tell him they gon' send yo ass right to jail
Pitching it hard, I never thought he'd listen to the God
When I would tell him not to be an addition to the yard
To my surprise, this nigga went to get a job
Now I be hearing him bragging 'bout his benefits and all
And I applaud whoever can climb out the hood
I hope and pray to Allah y'all can climb out for good
The hood is where the hate is at, I make it back
Just to bring some paper back, turn around, (rrrt!) make tracks
I got a kid, I'm a need a crib with the lawn
You can say what you want, nigga, I've been here for too

[Chorus]

Uh, check it out
Yo, I'm too black and too strong and been here for too long
Never did it right 'cause all I knew was how to do wrong
My people telling me to cut it out like a coupon
And act like a new man instead of like a newborn
Sometimes what I grow on, is difficult to chew on
And everything your crew on, is different than what you on
I'm through with bullshitting with my trivial pursuit on
And sitting at a stop sign, time to get a move on, 'cause
Criminal minds with minimal time
On the meter, got to be on they continual grind
Trying to find hidden treasure like subliminal signs
And escape mental prison or a chemical bind
And I'm a stone, but a stone can't do it alone
'Cause the truth can set you down like two in the dome
And make it all fall apart like the ruins of Rome
Yo, I'm a changed man headed for home

I know this crackhead who says she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring your customers a measuring pot
Her family members used to beg her to stop, couldn't explain
How to cook cocaine had her head in a lock
You hear the beat with this repetitive knock, that's the same way
They used to tell her she was at the edge of the dot
One night she woke up butt-naked in a crack house
Not knowing what happened, the bitch must've blacked out
Nobody to ask about what had taken place
Now she on the Internet with dog nut up on her face
And she caught another case trying to break in her mother place
Everything going wrong, she know it's 'cause of the base
Said it was just a pipe dream to get her life clean
Even thought it might seem like the right thing
Basically I just told her that red means stop
Yellow means slow, then you can go when the light's green
(I dropped jewels on her) That was her last night on the glass pipe
(Right) After thirteen years, that's right
She said, recommend a rehab and I'm gone
I wanna get strong, she said, I've been here for too long

Never interrupted the thug, she said pardon
Only eighteen, and still was fucking with Marvin
Her mother was a schoolteacher, her father was a sergeant
Them chickens in the club, my baby be out joggin'
Would even go as far, as giving the god noggin'
But when it came to the coochie, she just would not bargain
Did it all, takin' her shoppin', the ice department
Even put shorty up in a real nice apartment
Would come over at night sometime, with some roses and white wine
Tryin' to create the right time
For her to give me some behind, let me get it in
I know if I hit it once, she gon' want me to hit again

Seen what's in the car garage, shit is a mess

Or this relationship is put to a rest
Rather leave her than do her dirty son, this birdies the best
I had to show that respect,
She didn't deserve less
Step two, I'm like boo either we do what it do
Or you can give me the keys to the view cus' we through

You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found (that I found)

I used to get these feelings and think of these crazy things
But when you shine your light on me it's like you gave me wings
I thought I was depressed, you showed me how much more I was blessed
I'm thanking you lord, this I could confess
You know more than anybody all that I had to go through
I heard you when you said that's just somethin' I had to show you
For me to get to know you like I know you
And when the reaper tried to come to get me
You came to save me, I owe you
Some call you Jesus's father, but some say you the holy ghost
I know you love because when things get ugly you hold me close
This is why I try to live the life of 'just righteousness'
Feeling like the opposite something you wouldn't like for us

Not ashamed of my struggle

Facing my trials cause they only make me stronger
Starving in these streets will only elevate your hunger
Beat me down and laugh at me, tell me that this is foolishness
They can't take my hope away, from and nobody's movin' it

Tired of you forsaken, you naked left in it vacant

Can't rewind it and back up
Focus fixed on the future so tell my failures to backup
Get back up after you fall when your back is up on that wall
Ain't no backup that you control, just look back up at god and call

And them scars are the evidence that the journey was rough, yeah

Wasn't for Hoover he would be alive today
Bang, he got blown away

That man Clarence Smith was like a father to many
Was for the love cause the brother wasn't all for the penny
He said the black man was God and it costed him plenty
Was it the time or was no police officer friendly?
He birth the five percent nation, call him the true and living
And just for that you know they whooped him and threw him in prison
Wasn't for them he would be with us today

Marvin Gaye wrote a song called ''What's Going On?''
The label said no, but he convinced them to go along
He spoke of Vietnam and the shit that was going wrong
Tried to convince people that they needed to keep holding on

He wanted to save the hood, they understood why he was trying
He took a stand and said what he had to say

He was a racist, but he did what he said when he promised

They gave a nigga this look like, never again
And I looked back at them like never again

Suprised she still skinny, shorty swallows a lot

Without talkin', bout shit that isn't important
Like makin' a fortune off of somebody snortin'

Or will the people just assume that I'm sour within
I told my story to 40,000 people
Now it's time for me to get equal, the sequel

Saigon,"Cause I‚Äôve been up and I‚Äôve been down
And if it‚Äôs one thing that I‚Äôve found
You gotta keep pushing baby
I swear it feels like we almost made it
We on the way up yeah, don‚Äôt look down
Cause we so high off the ground
But you gotta push baby, to the top yeah, we almost made it

I relate more to struggle than to corpse and the bubbles
Your pain never champagne when you always in trouble
I‚Äôm at the dealership but I‚Äôm selling these cars
It‚Äôs a result of collecting my second felony charge
Watching fellows get lost, spitting bullshit bars
It‚Äôs like a mirage, niggas only write for the broads
As far as I could recall, there was only one tar
One dj, one king, one god, it seem all
Rookies they don‚Äôt respect us boy
Like they totally forgot came second thought
They don‚Äôt seem to reflect no more
That‚Äôs why they coming out sounding so similar
It‚Äôs quite confusing for you to limit the
Originator, boy do I hate em, fuck a perpetrator
Hater record label slave trader
My story the recipe of a grown man
Had to go put my destiny in my own hands

Cause I‚Äôve been up and I‚Äôve been down
And if it‚Äôs one thing that I‚Äôve found
You gotta keep pushing baby
I swear it feels like we almost made it
We on the way up yeah, don‚Äôt look down

But you gotta push baby, to the top yeah, we almost made it

I ain‚Äôt emerge to tell you how I splurge on the birds
I don‚Äôt give them nothing but word
And still hit the curve then swerve, to another nerve
Murders are perb, they heard the giddy like they heard in the word
33 in the third, what I spit is verbally is absurd
Never 33 in the third, it‚Äôs addictive, it‚Äôs urb, you heard
Come try fuck a nigga, I run you over, hit your head with the bumper sticker
It‚Äôs gonna take a month to fix you
I‚Äôm being sincere, when I say that you be in intensive care
I don‚Äôt think you really wanna visit there
Flow water, words flow like a motor boat
Been there and done it dony, I know the road
Front on me I go for broke, smoke with me it‚Äôs toe for toe
Joke with me in front of his cabin I‚Äôll make an open joke
Oops I told joke twice, but that‚Äôs alright
You motherfuckers know that I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶

Cause I‚Äôve been up and I‚Äôve been down

Don't let me be, just another one
I always told myself, I'll be here when it's done
I know they don't believe, but see we just begun
Momma I'm growin up, you gotta let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Hey
Momma I'm growin up, you gotta let me run

I don't know but I gotta go, gotta go slow, but I gotta go cause I gotta grow
The flow got a nigga fall but I gotta show that I got a lot mo' to go
I gotta blow
I won't take no, I don't think so
Hold on strong and no I won't let go
I'm almost there, I know I won't take long
I look in the rear and it's a long way home
Don't let me be, just another one
Momma I'm growin up, run that to your younger son
I'm the one when it's all said and done
Let it run to get a gun, the one that'll blow one
The one with the cold stare, niggas wanna go there
And oh yeah I don't fear no one
Right now Twista-like style
Quick to pipe down when usually I fight back
Now I'm lookin' like wow
I came to learn that my main concern's gripping the mic down
Wow, album number two, how comfortable, last one was for you
This one is for you and for frontin' niggas too
Comin' for you, now what you gonna do?

[Chorus]

Run away with the moonlight
Third eye too bright for me to lose sight
And I'm only fuckin' with niggas that move right
Can't rock with a man pants too tight
You belong in the blue light district
This prick take ""ho nigga"" to new height
You in the strip club you might
See a nigga throwing bread, no food fight, right
Got a style like Ike
The beat is my bitch, I'm wild for the night
Soup's upside your head when I spit it
Another DV tell the Feds I did it
Get on TV with a Red Sox fitted
Bet I won't go near Bed-Stuy with it
You know I'm just kiddin, Earth is our turf
I'm the person to say that first in my verse
Don't let me be, just another one
Just a statistic when I'm havin so much fun
I'm in the boom-boom room with a poon-poon
Lips smellin like perfume, wanna resume soon
Put your money where your mouth is
Bet you find your honey where my house is

[Chorus]

I don't know what I'm runnin' from
I don't know where I'm runnin' to
Seems your dreams are not comin' true
What the fuck are you gonna do?
Stop it now? How dumb are you?
How many lumps you want, one or two?
Your future's right there in front of you
Whatever you do with it is up to you
Not for nothin' but who the fuck are you?
Lot of other people are fucked up too
You ain't the only one who luck's up, boo
Life's a bitch, but you could fuck her too
Like I said mami, it's up to you
We don't do L's. W's

Rapping on arenas, rubberbands to the mobs
Getting high to Sinatra, in the sands of the palms
Reminiscing my rapping with BIG, the man with the don
Niggas did it big, but not like them
Drink champange in the ocean just to drown my sins
Should have (?) a valet, roll around my Benz

I have sighed at the sight of Paris.
All I want is you. All I need is you.
I would die from a soldiers bullet.
I would wait in the noon day sun.
I would cry from the highest mountain.
All I want is you. All I need is you.
I can run with the bulls in Spain.
I can have the finest jewels.
I could climb the himalayas.

I am the one who kneels down, don't you know?
I want the things only you could ever show.
You need a man who loves you more than his life.
Zero's the price for the ride into life.

All my life, I would dream it happened.

What a drag, drag, drag.
Cyanide and suicide. Don't you try.You're gonna bleed some more.

Come and let me tell you about social giants.
Heard about the news but no one buys it.

I'm on the side with the gun that fires.

Saigon Kick,"Said she was a sentimental girl from France
Mother was the victim of a failed romance
When she went to call upon the boy next door
She was really horrified at what she saw

Said he was a continental man from Greece
Wasn't really sure what that meant but at least
Promised her the life of dreams and a king?
Wasn't too long before bells were to ring

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around

So they lived their life upon a great big hill
Wasn't too long before blood was to spill
Hit him in the back with a tool from the shed
Now she's upset because she thinks he is dead

When she turned he rose above the hardwood floor
[Unverified]
He was right behind her and swinging a bat
Landed on her head with a soft wet smack

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around and around and around

Hit her on the head with a bat
Hit her on the head with a bat
Hit her on the head with a bat

Saigon Kick,"Sgt. Steve could barely read
He would take the children down
Throw them all around the ground
And make 'em bleed

Then Sgt. Steve
Would sing a song of victory
Wipe some snot off on his sleeve
And say goodbye to the clown

He would pray twice every day
He would not tolerate the gay
Oh, oh, oh
I'm alright, I feel that I'm coming around

Sgt. Steve, with all his needs
He would weed out the impure
He would guard our sacred shores
From the red, from the blue ones

Though we beat them once before
He had a feelin', not very sure
That they were back
Boys for attack

So we slit his throat for fear
We heard their footsteps very near
And oh, oh, oh
I'm alright, I feel that I'm coming around

So they shift their hips and they get in a little grind,

Steal the bread from the baker man,
And you make a fist with an outstretched hand,
And you feed 'em something that they don't own,
And you burn down the teacher's home,

You and I are heading for the end of time and there's no rhyme.
All we know is crashing down; the absence of the heart is now.
Can you run a little faster; won't you try?
We must beat ourselves to Eden or we'll die.

Trying to act like we just don't care,
So we jump around like it just ain't fair.
Throw your neighbors to the ground
And you take your stuff and you head downtown,

Knock the one that you need the most,
And you kiss the ass of the holy ghost.
Trick your friends so they think you're cool,
And you get up on the floor of your school,

Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.",White Room

Duerme descansa a mi lado
Deja que ba√±e tus labios 
Retomo el pulso y fijo una nueva se√±al 
Robas mi alma y dejo que lo intentes m√°s

Con noches nuevas vuelve a anestesiar

All dressed up
Now who could have wished for more.

We wined anc! dined and all was fine
Knowing that she was game
But' then I went and really spoiled it all
By filling up my glass again.
(For) one drink too many took the smile right off of her face
One lousy drink too many took the girl right out of my place
Well
I tried to talk her out of going home
But instead I fell flat on the floor
And all I remember ist a great big bang
I guess she must have slammed the door.
Well a couple of days and a hangover later
She gave me one more chance.
But only if I took her to ""CHEZ MAXIM""
For a fancy dinner and dance.
So we came to seek
Cheek to cheek
That moment we'd known before.
But then I went and did it all again
By filling up my glass once more.

With the red ruby lips
Whatever happened to the burning flames
With the swing on the hips

With a cool kind of look in her eye
She's like a flash from a movie show
Playing up to ""Marlowe"".

Tight skirts and ruby red lips
Stiletto heels are bound to make the boys talk
About her legs and her wiggeling hips
She doesn't need to speak a word at all
For her figure kind of says it all.
They talk about her in the neighbourhood
For good looks get around
She's always dropping into HolIywood
With the gents of the town
She likes to flirt with the right kind of man
But she can turn them into clay in her hand
And with the sound of her tiny feet
She'll turn heads on main street.

Saint Asonia,"How I try to pick up what I leave behind
The trail of lies follows me all the time
I've known all along the difference of right or wrong
The damage has been done and I can't just rewind
But I can try and try and try 'cause it makes me feel alive

And even though I say
I'm sorry I'm this way
And even though I've changed
People stay the same
And even though I don't play
I've become fair game
And if your looking at me 
Like I'm the cause of you live in hell
Well take a look at yourself

How you cry when I leave for the other side
Something makes me wanna go away but I can't decide

I'm getting closer to the edge

You can lie and lie and lie

Where the fuck we at now?

A big ass yellow, and green,
And purple, and faggot ass pink mushroom field

Well fuck it, let's go

Let's eat some of these bitches

Man I never did before, but since we in Oz and all

That's what I'm saying

Well let's at least walk while we eat, come on

[Chorus: x2]
Thoughts fly away in the mushroom field
Randomly telling what's revealed
Filling my pockets cause they worth a meal
And the kingdom's over them hills

Let me go ahead and eat a few of these things
See if I can't hang
What you thinkin' about?

Cigarettes, menthol only
To grow old with my kids and homies
All the years on that pole so lonely
And all them crows shittin' on me
What you thinkin' about?

Makin' payments on the Batmobile
With the phat sound system and 32 inch wheels
Everybody on the yellow brick jocking
Well I'm just snapping real slow
What you thinkin' about?

Nate The Mack, my homie from way back
Everybody got a homie like that
In fact, I hope he okay
I hope his momma doing good
(You should call him)
Maybe I should
What you thinkin' about?

Caddies
Sittin' on triple gold daytons
Sun shining on 'em and they sparkle up the pavement
People wanna catch a glimpse and show respect
Now I'm the king
Ruler over everything
What you thinkin' about?

A fine bitch and some weed to smoke
I gotta have a little bit of puss to poke
(You ain't no joke)
A fat bag of dro and a hoe
And that's all you really need to know
What you thinking about?

Titties
They come in all shapes and sizes
Each bitch with they own surprises
And if they only had on they back when hitting doggy
You can suck on that
What you thinking about?

Shit, finishing off my Megos set
And making that small dream an accomplishment
So I can find a new hobby like collecting skin
Never removed from the package all mint
What you thinkin' about?

Bitches
That's what I'm thinking about
They clothes so tight
Ass and titties lookin' so right
Stacks of cash and all kinds of tropical hash
And hittin' blunts till my last
Now what you thinkin' about?

Blaze Ya Dead Homie
(Who ya dead who?)
Who ya dead who?
Where I'm from that's cool
Anyway, I'm just wondering when it's Colton shit droppin'?
I'm tryin' to get my gold six hoping
What you thinking about?

Whatchin' my favorite wrestling pay-per-views
On a 100 foot screen
Televison tube
With the fast forward button
I can fly past the jobbers while eating pizza getting fat
What you thinking about?

Wizard, I really hope he's there
And he can help J get the fuck outta here
(I hear what you're saying crow, Tin what you think?)
(Man he better have some drinks)
What you thinkin' about?

What I'm thinkin' about, going home
And it's down this path we roam
Come on

Mov'in up to a new position

It's only springtime
Oh, you're too young
To say you're through with love

It's only springtime
And I'll be different, boy
I promise you, swear to you

Once more you tell me I'm glad when we're friends
You say your heart's been broken again
How many times have you looked into my eyes?
Don't you realize we're two of a kind?

With the love I've got, you'll forget about her
And find it easy to live without her

It's only springtime
Hey, you're too young to say
You're through with love

It's only springtime
And I'll be different, I'll be different
I swear to you

I've been watching all your love affairs
Three years now, don't you think I care?
How many times have you looked into my eyes?
Don't you realize we're two of a kind?

It's only springtime
You're too young to say
You're through boy

And I'll be different, I'll be different, boy

I see you like a lantern - / you have a certain glow. / calico. /
Your smile is warm soft, / forever / appealing. /
Whenever you are present like a letter I am sealing. /
My love / like a dove / that blesses from above. /
The shower in an hour / won't you let me be your towel? / calico. /

A fateful chance / with a twist of hope. /

Saint Etienne,"All of his friends have been wondering
Why he spent so long with her
He's so dark and moody
She is his sunshine girl

In the bed where they make love
She's in a film on the sheets
He shows dreams like a movie
She's the softness of cinema seats

He sees all of the girls
Like Demi Moore as she sighs
Dreams come true as he holds her
'Til the X's come up in her eyes

Like roses grow in a churchyard
Her skin white as the milk
Just like a Sherpa Tensing
Under a Manilla silk

I walk home everyday from my jobs
And the pay's not so good
To two rooms, it's not that much, where I keep my stuff
But I call it home

I wish that he'd come home
I wish that he'd come home

Lunch break, prescott street, where the people meet
And life seems so good
They're like the 45's
When I dream I'm dreaming of you
Watching tv every Friday evening


Just like you were home

At the snow shapes falling

I kiss his nice face, good morning sir !
He smiles and pulls me closer, says it's me he's living for.

La la la la, la la la, la la la.
I feel his arms wrapped around me.
La la la la, la la la, la la la.
He gives me love, la la la.

He comes every evening, for sure work gets him down.
But right there in the doorway, you know he ain't got no frown.
My heart begins to bump, I open the door.
He takes me in his arms, hey !, how could ask for anything more ?

In the city see all the old street lamps again
In the city they took all the new ones away

You wind down a window to let in some light
Through the middle of glossum [unverified] billboards at night
And pausing to catch your breath in the rain
In the city your home again, again

Do dooh, do dooh
Do dooh, do dooh

And I want to do it all now baby

Get over here and give me some explanation

I still don't hate her
What can I do
About you (c'est tres beau une femme qui pleure)

You're what I want
You're what I need
Don't ever change
Honey please
You took me on
To get me up
And then forgot
It's just enough
I couldn't live
Without you there
It means a lot
This sweet affair
I'll make a wish
About you and me
We'll feel like this
For eternity

Things to straighten in her head

As she clambers to her seat
With the ash of last night's party
Clinging grimly to her feet

Not for the first time
She's made her bed
Now she leaves that all behind and turns her mind
To playful things instead

Days spent making stories
For the faces that pass by
From the lonely tea shop owner
To the misbehaving wife

Now they're growing ever wilder
As the people start to go
Now she dreams that there's assassins
Hiding in the woods below

We need some open space
We need a change of pace

Is getting you down
And you long for a change
But won't it seem strange with fields all around?
We won't hear a sound

The grass may be greener
The air may be cleaner
But I love the city
I know it's not pretty
But at least there is life
You call this life?

Here we go over and over and over

In the country
Life feels right
Won't you trust me?

Hand me the remote
I'm not sure that we'd cope
In the middle of nowhere
Surrounded by fresh air
I'd miss my mates
This place is a state

You'd do your work from home
Online or on the phone
I could grow vegetables
Sounds like a load of balls

I said, I'd miss my mates

Lets groove a little now.

Saint James,"I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay 
Ain¬¥t it sad 
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me 
That¬¥s too bad 
In my dreams I have a plan 
If I got me a wealthy man 
I wouldn¬¥t have to work at all, I¬¥d fool around and have a ball... 
Money, money, money 
Must be funny 
In the rich man¬¥s world 
Money, money, money 
Always sunny 
In the rich man¬¥s world 
Aha-ahaaa 
All the things I could do 
If I had a little money 
It¬¥s a rich man¬¥s world 
It¬¥s a rich man¬¥s world 
A man like that is hard to find but I can¬¥t get him off my mind 
Ain¬¥t it sad 
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn¬¥t fancy me 
That¬¥s too bad 
So I must leave, I¬¥ll have to go 
To Las Vegas or Monaco 
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...

E ritrovarsi
Senza paura di tornare sui tuoi passi
Anche se poi lungo la strada quei rimorsi
Faranno a botte coi ricordi
Scrivendo ancor di bianco
Le notti senza tempo
Nella mia mente ancora c'√®
Quell'immagine di te
Che non so lasciare andare
Quello che voglio ormai non c'√®
Apro gli occhi e sento che
Forse √® tutto da rifare
Dimenticare
Fai come vuoi
Se c'√® un temporale passer√†
Vado via
Mi asciugher√≤
Sotto il cielo che mi porta a casa
Com'√® triste questa tua citt√†
Fai come vuoi
Ma fai la cosa giusta
E mettici l'anima
Se ce la fai senza di me
Dovr√≤ imparare a fare come te
Basta sentirsi
Solo parole
Per riempire quei discorsi
Per ritornare sul perch√©
Ci siamo persi
Cercando una ragione nuova
Per confondersi
Chiedersi cosa rimane
Lampi di luce in una storia senza fine
Le mani fredde in una notte da scaldare
Mi mancheranno quei tuoi occhi
Scrivendo ancor di bianco
Le notti senza tempo
Nella mia mente ancora c'√®
Quell'immagine di te
Che non so lasciare andare
Quello che voglio ormai non c'√®
Apro gli occhi e sento che
Forse √® tutto da rifare
Dimenticare
Fai come vuoi
Se c'√® un temporale passer√†
Asciugher√≤ queste mie pene
Con un'altra, forse dieci, cento
O aspettando che ritorni tu
Fai come vuoi
Ma fai la cosa giusta
E mettici l'anima
Se ce la fai senza di me
Dovr√≤ imparare a fare come te
Vado via (per sempre)
Vado via (ovunque)
Non ti lascio la mia nostalgia
La mia strada ora √® tutta in salita
C'√® da vivere senza di te
Fai come vuoi
Se ce la fai senza di me

Sal Marquez,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell

That all I longed for long ago was you

Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you 
",Long Ago (And Far Away) [From Cover Girl]
Salena Jones,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Salena Jones,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart [From My Foolish Heart]
Salena Jones,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie

Salena Jones,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend",You've Got a Friend (Moonlight Sonata)
Salena Jones,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
",Canadian Sunset

If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade

Salena Jones,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain

I'm laughing at clouds so dark above

Salena Jones,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Salena Jones,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Salena Jones,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue

Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;
 

",Who's Sorry Now
Salena Jones,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I‚Äôve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I‚Äôll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I‚Äôm not alone anymore

This is mine you can‚Äôt take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I've been near you, but you never noticed me

That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
