Poco,"I've seen a picture from the Days Gone By
Lookin' worn and withered, I heard a lonely cry
Of what could have been
And what wasn't quite
Now I'm swearin' to the wind
We were doin' it right

Here in the night so far away from it all
Out of my sight, how far down did we fall
From grace created
Oh how we related
In the picture from the days
The Days Gone By

You were letting your friends get in the upper hand
I had to turn the other way
You could not understand
And now we're out on our own
You have to wonder what lasts
When all that's left to recognize
Is a scene from the past

Here in the night so far away from it all
Out of my sight, how far down did we fall
How far down did we fall
How far down did we fall
(In the Days Gone By)

",Days Gone By
Poco,"Save A Corner Of Your Heart for me
Keep it for a rainy day
Just a little touch
You won't miss it much
Won't you save, save it for me

Well I'm not the kind who keeps track of time
Still I've seen the seasons change
It's such a subtle move, such a gentle groove
You don't feel it slip away

[REPEAT CHORUS]
Oh it can't be long we must carry on
There's so much we have to do
But every time I hear lovers whisper near 
I will always think of you, won't you...

[REPEAT CHORUS]
[BRIDGE:]
Just toe the line for now
I'll get back there somehow
Give it a chance you'll see

REPEAT CHORUS",Save a Corner of Your Heart
Poco,"Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I've never been imprisoned by
A faded memory

Just when I think I'm over her
This broken heart will mend
I hear her name and I have to cry
The tears come down again

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wrapped around my heart
Refusing to unwind
Ooh-ooh, crazy love, ah

Count the stars in the summer sky
That fall without a sound
And then pretend that you can't hear
These teardrops coming down

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wrapped around my heart
Refusing to unwind
Ooh-ooh, crazy love, ah

Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I've never been imprisoned by
A faded memory

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wrapped around my heart
Refusing to unwind
Ooh-ooh, crazy love, ah

Tonight I'm gonna break away",Crazy Love
Poco,"(Chorus:)
Standing in the midnight rain, all alone with the pieces of my heart again
Knowing one of us is right, and one of us is gone into another night
You've gone running all alone, running all alone

Into another night, you've gone running all alone
I've still got these feelings left, living in my heart and in my head
Breaking from the past, I've come to know at last
Only a fool would stay, stay and pretend, until the very end
Only a fool would stay, to the very end

I need you more than anyone or anything under the sun
Don't leave me lonely here, I get so lonely here

(chorus)
(Solo)
I need you more than anyone or anything under the sun

Poco,"(Chorus:)
Sometimes we are all we got, this time I have not forgot
Even a blind man can see, that it could be you,
it might be me
And sometimes we are all we got

It was a long hot summer run,
back in the middle of sixty-four
Down by a clearing just out of the sun,
I swore I had been there before
When a shot rang out and suddenly I was face to face
with the enemy

Sometimes we are all we got, this time I have not forgot
A boy of eighteen and Southern bred,
his troops had left him there for dead
Laying up against a big oak tree,
it had all come down to either him or me
Just one of those times, two lives on the line
Is this the last thing I'll ever see?

(chorus)
This time I have not forgot, this time I have not forgot",Sometimes (We Are All We Got)
Poco,"Now and then you see me falling, way behind the things I need to do
Don't you believe I've missed my calling, I'm just the one to play your fool

(Chorus:)
Under the gun, under the gun, I'm down and crawlin' like I've never done
Under the gun, under the gun, standing in my own way and nowhere to run

Waited so long it felt like a lifetime and looking up just seemed so far away
Between these walls I live on the bottom line
It's just enough to get me through the day

(chorus)

Now and then you see me falling, way behind the things I need to do
Don't you believe I've missed my calling, I'm just the one to play your fool

Poco,"There are images around us, in everything we see
Some are real and some are fantasy
To the one who sees his vision,
to the child who lives his dreams
You're the one to decide what you're gonna be

[Chorus]
So give it your best, and don't worry about what some may say
Follow your dreams, it's really all that you can do
Give it your best, and remember that life is what you choose
Follow your dreams, and do what you love to do

There are places you'll remember, and times you may recall
Faces that refresh your memory
May the thoughts that you will picture, help you come to see
That you're the one to decide what you're gonna be

So give it your best, and don't worry about what some may say
Follow your dreams, it's really all that you can do

Poco,"When you're down, and feelin' low, and there ain't nobody,
and no place to go
Don't feel alone, 'cause you have a friend,

So many times we go astray and we need somebody
to show us the way,
Don't be afraid, 'cause you have a friend,
look within, look within.

Within every soul, there was left the seeds of need
As in the soil of the earth, they are concealed
Prayer is the rain, to make 'em grow
Water them well, and they shall yield.

there is somebody waitin' on you
Open your heart 'cause you have a friend,
look within, look within.

Poco,"Oh the world has got its problems, they're comin' into view
And girl I know that we will surely do what we can do
But while we're in the midst of changing darkness into light
Gonna be beside you, to keep you warm at night.

And I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day
Oh, now recently it's clear to me, what makes the world uptight
Is the lack of joy we have, for the love of what feels right
But you and I are makin' the change, along with all our friends
And it feels so good to let you know, for me it all begins.

When I'm lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day.
I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day.


Oh, jobs are gettin' fewer, and the rents are on the rise
When I look at what it costs to live, I can't believe my eyes
But you and I are not alone, the whole world is feelin' it too
And I'm gonna do the best I can, and while I'm here with you.

I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day.

Poco,"You think you've got it in the palm of your hand
Then it slips through your fingers like a grain of sand
You're blood in the water to a hungry shark
It slips in silent then it rips you apart

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, it's famine or feast, that's the nature of the beast
Screams like an eagle, cries like a dove, oh-oh,
that's the nature of love

Now some will find it on their wedding day
Some will never give their hearts away
It can be so cold you, think you're gonna freeze
Or burn you up like a slow disease

Like blood in the water to a hungry shark
It slips in silent then it rips you apart

Poco,"Cryin' doesn't ease the pain
When the fire is gone, when the weak break the strong
There's no danger, when a heart is cold
But if I stay alone, mine will soon turn to stone

I know - girl you're not the only one
who's looking for someone to hold

[Chorus:]
The look in your eyes ain't the same anymore
Something has changed deep inside
We both know it's right, what are we waiting for
There's no holding back,
'cause with you I've got nothin' to hide

Sleepin' on a bed of lies
I've been lonely too long,
now the hurt is all gone
You were waiting for me to come around
How could I be so blind, not to see in your mind

And your heart - you've always been the only one
believin' in me all along

Poco,"If I had my way tonight,
I would surely change your mind
You might be surprised at what you see
I know I don't look the part,
don't turn it off before it starts
I can hear your heart talkin' to me

[Chorus:]
I'm not a stone that's been polished and shined
I'm not the diamond that you had in mind
I can't hide it, you get what you see
I've got a lot of rough edges on me

Carnegie or Albert Hall,
you don't need no crystal ball
You know you'll never catch me in that scene
I like my music way up loud, the house is rockin'
when I go out

Poco,"I know I'm in over my head, I'm walkin' a fine line
Tryin' not to be the one who falls in and out this time
I'm just gonna hold my breath, close my eyes and pray
I'm not gonna worry now, tomorrow's too far away

When people say that it can never last,
heaven will just slip out of our grasp
People don't believe a day goes by,
we don't end up saying our goodbyes
What do people know, what do people know

There's always been a chance you and I won't last forever
We've been in and out of love before, I'll never say never
I'm just gonna hold my breath, close my eyes and pray

Poco,"I remember the feeling, not so long ago
The kids came dancin', their hearts were romancin'
And the music was live Poco
Some called it country, some called it rock and roll
But whatever the sound, it was sure to be found
With a heart, rhythm and soul

[Chorus]
Do you remember then, how it was when it all began
Do you remember then, how the music made you feel,
when it all began
Ooh do you remember when, when it all began,
Ooh do you remember when

New York and Boston, yeah we sure had some fun
Summer nights in the park, and when the music would start
Ooh what a time and then some
We sang together, ""a good feelin' to know""
Yeah we turned it up loud, gave our hearts to the crowd
But then came the end of the show

[Chorus]

To capture the moment, to make it ours for all time
I know we can just remember how it was,
when it all began

When words aren't made clear
They become meaningless

It's been a long time a-comin' but now you're gone

Oh, look at me sittin', starin' at the rain
Knowin' the days that we once knew won't ever come again
Well it seems to strange to really be
So I pinch myself and I find oh, yeah, it's me

It's been a long time a-comin' and I have to carry on
It's been a long time a-comin' but now you're gone

And it's too late to turn, back all the clocks in town
It's too late to take the X from yesterday
Now the die is cast, nothin' happens in the past
So I'll think I'll take a walk out in the rain

Oh, here I go, walkin' down the street in time
I'm never knowin' though I'm tryin' to keep myself in rhyme
Just a while has now become too long
Consequently to you I can say, goodbye, so long, yeah

It's been a long time a-comin' and I have to carry on
It's been a long time a-comin' but now you've gone, you were gone right

Poco,"Here it comes, another heartache
Bringing me pain and misery
It's peekin' 'round the bend sayin'
""Hey my friend, sit down, and keep me company.""

Always seems to me that 
I make the biggest fool and tragedy.
Tellin' you this time I'm gonna stay in line,
No one's a-gonna bother me.

Think about the times, if you can, and I'll let you
Remember the rhymes that we talked when we were new.
I can recall the days when I'd wake up 
To find you beside me,
But you could have stayed
'Stead of takin' off that way..

Until that ol' sun goes down
And darkness helps me hide my shameful tears

It's a shame she wears the name

It's an old fashioned sigh
I kinda get the feelin' like, you know when

Kind woman, won't you love me tonight?
I've seen the look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's alright

Remember once before you're hearing the old folks say
Love's an ageless old rhyme
But now a days you know the sayin' depends so much on
The kind of woman that you find

I don't know why we can't get along; when we first started out nothin' ever went wrong

I love to hear your voice but your choice of words just blows my mind
And I'm not foolin' 'cause I don't believe in what you see involvin' me in all of your schemin'

You say you want my love and then you're willing to return it and what you're doin' now ain't about to earn it
'Cause you're driving me mad with your nagging ways and in my kind of love that ain't what pays

I love to hear your voice but your choice of words just blows my mind
And I'm not foolin' 'cause I don't believe in what you see involvin' me in all of your schemin'

It was on my mind both night and day and you better listen now to what I got to say
'Cause I know our love is much too good to be broke up by something misunderstood

Poco,"Break of hearts
Drifting to far apart
To be heard
Empty words
Making up too late from a losing start

Break of hearts
Waiting on a loosing game
Fleeting thing
Beautiful thing
There's nothing here worth saving
Too many pieces now all breaking

We were two crazy fools
Running out of things to do
Betting on distant dreams
Getting only empty things

Giving up
We were both beyond trying
I've had enough
There's something here that's dying

Drifting too long too far apart

Stands in vain
While night winds moan and whisper

When you're all alone
And you still think you're right
How will you feel tonight

Always running
You never walk
Do you ever listen
Or do you just talk

Afraid to take a chance

A different situation
When there's nobody there

The kind you can't get
Just anywhere

I'm caught between a rock and a hard place
I'd give anything just to see your face

Bringing me that special care

On the southern sea 
And it whirls around 
Deep inside of me 
Always bringing me up 
Never letting me down 
I had a dream I was on my way 
To Bridgetown 

I've seen ships that sail 
Each and every day 
And when they start up their engines 
They steal my heart away 

Barbados 
I'm another one born to run 
Barbados 
I need another sweet taste of rum 
I been sailing on this raging sea 
The higher the venture 
The better I'll be 
Barbados",Barbados
Poco,"Yes, I was careless with my heart
You'd think I'd know
Falling, that's the easy part
I just let go
I'd never given everything
But you were worth that risk
I've never loved, I've never hurt like this

I play the scene back in my head
Goes 'round and 'round
There was so much I left unsaid
It's too late now
If you were here I'd bare my soul,
And the first words from my lips
I've never loved, I've never hurt like this

A thousand emotions
That's what you've given me
From heartbreak to devotion
Every shade that love can be

I know I'll move beyond regret
I won't give up
Still, it's my heart that won't forget
It knows too much
My lowest low, my highest high
In a single good-bye kiss
I've never loved, I've never hurt like this
",Never Loved...Never Hurt Like This
Poco,"I never saw it comin'
I guess I should have known
When nothin' lasts forever
It's here and then it's gone
Well, I'll take each day as it comes

But I'll be missin' you
I'll be missin' you
I'll be missin' you one tear at the time

People try to tell me
I'll get over it
Just go on you'll forget her
But it's not that easy to forget

So I'll take each day as it comes
And somehow I'll carry on

Just as long as there's breath to breathe
And my heart keeps beating on
Just as long as there's sky above
And lovers keep on fallin' in love
I'll keep dreamin', I'll keep holdin' on",One Tear at a Time
Poco,"She wears her trouble like a backpack
Big ol' rock sack weighin' her down
Drag her feet on the ground
Her heart breakin'
She can't shake it
There's a blues in her bones won't leave her alone
Like a Jones for a fix, some anonymous kick
She can't name it
She can't shake it
She gussies all up and slips into her nightclub clothes
Tops it all off at the bottom with capezios
There's a place right down the street
The resurrection with a disco beat

She's gonna dance, dance, dance
Like a sufi in trance, can't break it
Whirlin', twirl, see the girl's spine tingle and snake it
And the burdens on her mind
Are off to another space and time
She's gonna make it
She's gonna shake it

She's back on the streets when the club shuts down
But the heat beats strong like a heartbeat sound
No escapin'
She can't shake it
She jingles in the front of a sidewalk shop
Pawns her watch for a hot Walkman
Tells the man, I'll take it
She can't shake it
There's a mood on the edge of her mind like a big, black cloud
She slaps on a rap track, jacks the phones way up loud
And the music soothes her brain
As the groove pulses through her veins",Shake It
Poco,"She could pack her things and slip away
Save her pride for another day
He could go on pretendin'
He's said, all there is to say

That if love is never ending
When broken hearts need mending
They find a way to hold on to
What matters most of all

There are no rules, there are no truths
No reason, there's no rhyme
There's just your heart, to see you through
It tells you every time

And when you feel it down deep inside
Without a doubt
That's what love is
That's what love is all about

Oh, it's a crazy world and she knows it
She knows how the pieces fit
All the things that they've been through
They're too hard to forget

But if love is never ending
When broken notes need mending
They find a way to hold on to
What matters most of all

There are no rules, there are no truths
No reason, there's no rhyme
There's just your heart, to see you through
It tells you every time

And when you feel it down deep inside
Without a doubt
That's what love is
That's what love is all about

So, she'll have a little faith
And hold on a little harder
'Cause she knows just what it takes
And that's what love has taught her

There are no rules, there are no truths
No reason, there's no rhyme
There's just your heart, to see you through
It tells you every time

And when you feel it down deep inside

In the heart of the night 
In the cool southern rain 
There's a full moon in sight 
Shining down on the Pontchartrain 

And the river she rises 
Like she used to do 
She's so full of surprises 
She reminds me of you 
In the heart of the night 

There's a nightbird singing 
Right on through till the dawn 
And the streets are still ringing 
With people carrying on 

It's been so long waiting 
Just to be here again

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

This force is running you around now
Getting you down now
Where is your pleasure now Johnny
Where has your pleasure gone now

What's the crime, man
Caught in space
Nothing and everything is
Always always always

What's your hurry
What's the hurry
There's no need to drive yourself so crazy
Solar reaction, ruptures the skin

And the sky above is saying
The world is caving in
Don't worry, don't worry

[Chorus]
Another world 
Another time
Another place
Don't you worry, my baby

See you're afraid to make that change
Just close your eyes
Then let me explain it to you, it's easy
Oh so easy,
There's no need to drive yourself so crazy

Bypass those channels of your memory
Why don't you mute those crenvulses
And those frequencies, and don't worry
No don't worry, it's just living

[Chorus]

Drop everything
This must be the end of the world
This might be heaven or hell
Or it may just be another world
Or it may just be another world

Beautiful girl,
You must've been a beautiful baby too
Beautiful woman, 
You must've had your moments inside the sun
Beautiful girl

Beautiful stranger
Why do you have to walk with your head hung low
Beautiful girl

Your eyes are mockingbirds inside a guilded cage
Your life's a silent movie that I haven't heard for ages
Tell me everything, someone's gotta hear this
Beautiful thing

Beautiful mother, frozen in ice
I've waiting for you to grow for my whole life

Poe,"I can see it out my window
That stupid sunshine 
And those trees
A voice my head
It cuts me down in
I try to shut it up but I can't let it go (oh!)

It sounds a lot like you do
Always saying shit I know it's not true 
It sucks me in
It spits me out
I try to shut it up 'cause I must let it go

[Chorus]
Hey man don't you know you're choking the cherry
Hey man don't you know me better than that
Sucking me in
Spitting me out
One day I may just leave you far behind me

I can hear it in the hallway
It's out there laughing with its friends
It's a voice in my head
It cuts me down in
I try to shut it up 'cause I must let it go (oh!)

It looks a lot like you do
It looks like--uh--I don't want to say it
It sucks me in
It spit it out
I try to shut it up 'cause I must let it go

Woah man don't you know you're choking the cherry
I'm frustrated why don't you get off my back
Hey man don't you know you're the choking the cherry
Hey man you know I deserve better than that
One day I may just leave you far behind me

Maybe it is time I learn how to swim

And other times I think that I'm fine
But something got into my engine
It slowed me down
Now I gotta turn this whole thing around

I'm gonna be a dolphin
Gonna be a dolphin
I'm gonna be a dolphin

I mistrust everything I had been longing for

And other time I think you're so fine

God I hope I don't sink like a stone -- no
I'm gonna move like a dolphin
There may be a lot I don't know about you

But I know if I don't swim
I'm already drowning

Is a broken bridge

Poe,"Your fingertips... your fingertips

Sometimes I feel it burning
That deep and primal yearning
I feel it burn, burn, burning
I try live without it
But then I think about
Those fingertips, those fingertips, those fingertips

[Chorus]
Anyone will do, anyone will do
Could be you

It's in the way they move and
They catch that simple groove and
They tell a story all their own about the human heart alone

Those fingertips, those fingertips

Fly fly away

She's got a run in her stocking and she's missing the heel of her shoe
Got up this morning rolled out of bed
I spilled a Diet Coke
Called my mother
Said, ""Hi."" What I meant to say was:
""Why is your life a joke?""
Then I went down to that ugly bar and
I clicked my heels three times just like you said
And I climbed that road to your empty house
The anticipation was a turn-on...but you let me down
'Cause I stood on that empty street alone
I said, ""I'm ready for my close-up now, Mr. Demille.""
I waited for the light but it never shone
Well I wonder what you do with that expensive piece of land
That overlooks a billion years of history (I have a sneaking suspicion)
You will never understand
Hey maybe I'll see you down by the Rocky & Bullwinkle
And we can talk to that charlatan psychic
And she can paint a prettier picture of your future.

'Cause that day in my life...
That day in my life...
I dreamt tomorrow had a prettier face
I dreamt tomorrow would have better things to say
Than, ""You look like shit, what's your problem, bitch?
You're legs feel like sandpaper, you can't do anything right."" 
'Cause that day never should have taken place
'Cause this day in my life still cannot explain
Why I listened in the first place

Seem to say what I'm doing here
My tongue is all twisted around the air
I'm looking for words that were so well rehearsed
But I can't find them anywhere
With you there's no easy answer
It's true
You change the equation that I add up to
And all of the things I thought I knew
You turn it around

I'm amazed
When push comes to shove what I'd give to you
Everything
I'm amazed
The hallways I wouldn't mind crawling through
And I'd do it for days and days

I'm amazed, I'm amazed

That places your taking me to

Wait, I thought I had this down
I built all my cages and my hide out
I covered all my bases

You creep in like a whisper
I try not to listen but I hear you
I don't know just what it is you do
But do it again

I'm amazed

And here in the foyer the hallway is small
I don't really think it's a hallway at all
It's a maze

Johnny your suitcase was finally received
She's packed up her things and she's ready to leave

It's amazing

All of the ink that was bled from your hands
Has painted a picture that she understands
It's amazed

And here by the ocean the sky's full of leaves
And what they can tell you depends on what you believe
It's a maze

The ass is a tree and the voices were three

Like a tiny mosquito and trembling in fear

Well you may be king for the moment
But I am a queen understand
And I've got your pawns and your bishops
And castles
All inside the palm of my hand

While you had your eyes closed
While you were licking your lips

While you were selling your soul
While you were tearing a hole in me

Now I have taken control
Now I have taken control...

This is beginning to feel good
Watching you squirm in your shoes
A small bead of sweat on your brow
And a growl in your belly your scared to let through

You thought you could keep me from loving
You thought you could feed on my soul

I gave you the benefit

And underneath the table in my living room
Outside by the blue blue moon

You can call me what you will
Call me a slut call me a jaded pill
But darlin', I've got your number now

I'm not a virgin anymore

I've been hung up

Before you let another lie
Go through those crooked little teeth
I don't think you want to start that shit with me

Poe,"This place feels so unfamiliar
And yet I know it well
I think I used to belong here
But the only way I can tell
Is that I miss you still
And I cannot find you here
You left me tattered and torn
Just like that Spanish doll

(Sweet spanish sweet spanish... doll)

I went down to the alley way
(Sierra la Bonita)
And found that you were gone
Spanish doll: si nunca tes fueres (if you had never left)
You left no word no message
I still don't know what went wrong
Spanish doll: la grima (tears)
But now no matter where I go
I always seem to return

To where you left me tattered and torn

Beauty guarded and never sold
Spanish doll: cuida me (protect me)
I keep it with me wherever I go
And I love you still
No matter how a story will unfold
Spanish doll: requerda me (remember me)
You know I always will
Have part of you here
In this souvenir
This sweet spanish doll

A stranger in this world without you
Is all that I can ever be
All I know that's pure and clear
You left it with me here

It's tearing away my patience and my wit
I must take proper measures set a trap for it

I don't care what you've done
I don't care who you've won
I know in the end you'll have your fun

But you can't have it hear
And I won't let you steer
You know I don't want you in my mind

I must stay calm you know and I must be clear
It's gonna take a hundred thoughts to make this one disappear
A train like that could travel a soul for years
A terrible thought could have a terribly long career

What minds have you shredded
I bet they regretted
Having ever thought you up
Just look at you shine
committing your crimes
You know I don't want you in my mind

You poisonous vine
You're strangling me inside
You're breaking my stride

You poisonous vine
You're strangling me inside

What a terrible thought...

What is your greatest worry because you seem to be worried all the time

Mom? are you there? are you sleeping? I'm so bummed.

You think you've got it figured out and then you find that you don't
So you say goodbye to the world and now you're floating in space
You got no sense of nothing not even a time or a place
Then suddenly you hear it it's the beat of your heart

[ VERSE 1: The Poetess ]
Growin up as a kid I never understood the things my dad did
Like hittin my mother, me and my brother hid
In the parlor from the chaos, the cryin and the cussin
The fightin and the fussin
I used to go to bed holdin my ears tight
Filled with fear when I hear moms and pops fight
I never quite understood what the reasons were
How could he love my mother if he kept on hittin her?
I don't know, but what I do know is this
Love hurts when it's comin from the throw of a fist
And the list goes on from the mental to the physical
Use of verbal abuse, beatdowns, it ain't cool
It's bad enough we got it rough in society
Oppression and poverty, no need to be fightin 
Each other, a brother hits a sister, and he's a bigger nigga
He ain't nothin if he gotta hit, pick a
Innocent victim three times smaller in size
Head honcho, macho in whose eyes?
Only a fool tries abuse to utilize 
Physical force to control, hurt, brutalize
Time for change, to rearrange the chain of thought
Unball your fist and think of the pain was brought
To the hearts of your brother or your sis
Love hurts when it's comin from the fist

[ Def Jef ]
Now I want you to think of six women that's close to you
And I want you to think if somebody was beatin on em
What would you do?

[ VERSE 2: Def Jef ]
I wish my step pop would stop hittin on moms
She got bruises on her arm from protectin her face from harm
Bein done he looks at me and says, ""What you're seein, son
Is me disciplinin my woman
You're gonna hate me for the rest of your life
But this is my wife""
And I'm thinkin I want to stab him with a steak knife
Too little to interfere, I wish he would disappear
But he won't, so I put the pillow over my ear in fear
Dreamin when I get to be a man I'ma stand up to him
If I see him hit her again I'ma do him
I encourage her to go, she says, ""No
I love him, I stay""
""Mom, what you see in that idiot anyway?
He beats you and mistreats you
Daddy wouldn't do that"" 
But she said: ""Your daddy did it too""
Ain't that much love in the world to be gettin bruised for
Used, abused or even singin the blues for
He's addicted to inflictin abuse, he said he'll quit
If he's the one with the habit, then why you always takin the hit?
A weak later the same shit - I doubt it
I'm grown now, mommy, don't even worry about it

(In 20% of child abuse cases a spouse will be involved in)

[ VERSE 3: The Poetess ]
I was twelve years old when daddy started to get rough
Puff in one hand, the other holdin a glass of that 80 proof stuff
He never got enough, I thought he was tough, but it was all a bluff
I tried to understand and got verbally beat down
But I thought one day he would come around
But man, oh man, was I mistaken
Nothing's right in his life and the abuse I was takin
I was accused of things I never thought of
Good grace got no praise
But I got a lotta negative words thrown in my heart like a dart
With the point of steel
Killin me softly at his will
The big one came when I got the blame for
Not bein the joy of a boy that he aimed for
One day I came home, he was sittin in the chair by the front do'
Just waitin to let go
(Where you been all night, out hoein?)
He didn't raise, rolled up in his gut, I got a blow
And that was it, the last hit, he'll ever do
The pearl handle was popped and cocked and it blew
The only thing on my mind was payback, let's say that
I've put an end to that madness and pray that
I can overcome what mentally dad did well
While I count the days in my padded cell

(Several women a day are killed by ah, battering)

[ VERSE 4: cool G. Rap ]
Does he love her or does he hate her?
That's what I'm thinkin as I look at mommy hooked up to a respirator
It started with a smack
And that smack became a punch and then a kick and then a broken back
But mommy never dropped dime
Now she's damn near blind, yo, what the hell is on my pop's mind?
I feel like gettin daddy done in
And put like one in his gun and pull the trigger and start runnin
Man, I see the walls turnin red
I'm gettin kinda fed so instead of the lead, how bout a burnin bed?
In order for my mother to last
So while he's laid up, straight up, I be puttin some gas on his ass
Blow him up like a grenade
And this is for all the times my mother used to wear shades
Tryin to cover the damage he did her
So when that fire's on your ass you remember how you hit her

*C.LOCO*
Young mack Mr Point Blanc lay down the facts
*POINT BLANC*
Recollections memories unfold days of the old
I hold precious like 24 carat gold
Visions of my life back in a time of backpackin'
Struggling empty pockets pipe water I be guzzlin'
Thirst from burning sun blazin' down the earth
Ipoh City the land where my hip hop gave birth
*YOGI B*
Let me tell you a true story my true story
From the kampung to city unbelievable glory
I sat down in solitude and wrote rhymes everyday
I dreamed I would be a great rapper somehow someway
So I journey on up and down every record label in town
$ 1.20 for the mini bus but mostly I walked around
Took all the rap competitions shared my skills wit so many
Major labels won't sign me up but Hip Hop ain't about money

Chorus

*POINT BLANC*
The present situation back in '97
Lifestyles hectic circumstances be critical
Intense pressure drivin' my mental maniacal
Craftin' an album on a level that be radical
Still I remain the mack as I was way back
True to the fact that hip hop's my greatest asset
*C.LOCO*
It's human nature we survive when all other fails
Try to make a living when fools tellin' tall tales
Undeniable rap skills made viable
It's not impossible high standards are attainable
Without doubt when we're two steps ahead
Indirectly cause a revolution in the industry
Totally incur phenomenal popularity
With mad respect and hold street credibility
The Ammo be Poetic give props to our name
I still be the same Mad Wizard in tha game

Now let me put into a line the story history of

Ago as an innocent young brat who loved
Hip hop glad that I did now no one is gonna
Stop me even though there are gonna be hard
Times and good times I see as if I've never
Gone through this pain and misery no matter
What changes my devotion I will be the same
And my emotion and my name
The Black Chinaman seeking no fame no
Temptation bootie calls nor Asian dolls
Hey Siew Koon ! It's time I've learned my lesson
No way no more of this stress of this foolishness
Appreciate my kindness baby

Poetic Hustla'z,"Smoke some weed
Keep me high
Til I die, die, I'll be high, high
I feel my weekend buzz
Cause I'm still fucked up from the weekday
Weekend buzz, 'cause I'm still fucked up from the weekday

[Boogy Nikke]
I'm lovin' my weekend buzz
I smoke my swisha sweet with honey
Tony Tone, ge,t me a light to make a shit
Hit the light - did you pin the playa hation last night?
I'm gettin' stick it while I'm pinnin' all the sticky intentions
And the bitches and all them rag-to-riches-ass niggas
Take me back to the time when we was all in the back
And I jack that nigga for his swoll, twenty sack
Now what would ya do if a nigga had a blunt
And never smoked with you like you do?

[Tony Tone]
Just pass that blunt over to me
And let me hit that Henessey
Cause I'm still fucked up from last night
But a nigga like me got the sticky
I mean I gotta have mo' weed than little bit
I need that icky sticky shit before I have a weed fit
Cause drinkin' brews is nothin' new to me
P.O.D. and that's my speciality everyday and that's how life should be
All day long keep my head full of smoke
Until my lungs can't take no more
I guess I continue to choke, and smoke, and choke
I feel my weekend buzz, 'cause I'm still fucked up from the weekday

[Mo! Hart]
I'm sittin' on the side of my bed, just gettin' up
Nigga, these days I gotta wake up to a fat-ass blunt
Gettin' high is like a bare necessity
Just the feelin' that I get sometimes get the best of me
I'm already in my own world
But now it's enhanced by this green shit that I'm holdin' in hands
Spark up the flame, prepare for the countdown
'Cause, shit, I know damn well what's 'bout to go down
Smoke-session 'bout to go down
What? It's 'bout to go down

[Krayzie]
It's the last day of the week, finally Friday
And high we unwind, been handlin' millions
Collectin' chips, so now I want to get high tonight
Pockets tight, any tighter - they just might rip
When you get your money right, nigga
You smoke how much you like, and it's nice
Love marijuana, weed, la la, la la, whatever ya wants to call it
It's all good if it keeps me high
Here's another weed song, now sing along
Get your reefer on - Whoo!
Nigga, get ya reefer on
Remember ""Buddah Lovaz?""
One, after another
Yeah, now, how high can you go
'cause you know we can choke (choke)?
You know we can choke (choke, choke)
Yeah, ha ha, nigga
I said you know we can choke (choke, choke, choke, choke)

[Boogy Nikke]
It's my weed, punk, we get on 'til the break of dawn
Whatever you want, Tony Tone
Then bring it on, rollin' blunt after blunt

Puffin' and chokin' 'til I P.O.D

I'm goin' broke on reefer smoke, done spent up all of my cheese

Poetic Justice,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

Poets of the Fall,"Oooooh 

More than you know it, I'm aware 
Of this connection that we share 
Yeah I know it seems like sometimes I don't care 
But you are the colours that I wear 
It's been a few hours, nearly dawn 
You've been real quiet all along 
Now I cannot help but think there's something wrong 
Hey baby what's going on? 

3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better) 
On our way into the light 
Now 3 AM is gone 
Along with where there's nothing wrong 
3 AM we seemed alright 

If I have been thoughtless, let me know 
I can take a hint you know 
Though I'm a little slow 
Just don't keep it in you 
Lest it take root and grow 
The bottom line here is I love you so 

3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better) 
On our way into the light 
Now 3 AM is gone 
Along with where there's nothing wrong 
3 AM we seemed alright 

3 AM we seemed alright (Like never better, like never better) 
We're on our way into the light 
Now 3 AM is gone 
Along with where there's nothing wrong 
3 AM we seemed alright 

Ooooh 

3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better) 
On our way into the light 
Now 3 AM is gone 
Along with where there's nothing wrong 
3 AM we seemed alright 

Ooooh 

3 AM we seemed alright (Like never better, like never better) 
On our way into the light 
Now 3 AM is gone 
Along with where there's nothing wrong

Poets of the Fall,"Sometimes I know there is nothing to say 
So, do I pick up my puzzle and just walk away? 
Do I follow my conscience? 
Am I mock sincere? 
I don't know what I'm doing here 

I have a knack for perceiving things 
I can see how it sounds 
I can feel how it sings 
When you paint me an image of who you are 
I know it's the best by far 

So 
Don't, don't, don't mess my hair 
If all you do is fake it 
Don't, don't, don't say you care 
'Cause I could never shake it 
Don't, don't, don't mess with me 
Don't, don't, don't mess with me 

No point of view is enough to quell 
The rigors of passion in this world I dwell 
If I'm going to scale the highest wall 
I'm gonna give it my all 

Riding along with this train of thought 
I see everything 
I find all I sought 
And I try to kick the habit of trying to reach 
But there's something I do beseech 

So please... 
Don't, don't, don't mess my hair 
If all you do is fake it 
Don't, don't, don't say you care 
'Cause I could never shake it 
Don't, don't, don't mess with me 
Don't, don't, don't mess with me 

I'll say it's not surprising 
You're sweet talking, mesmerizing 
Juicy and appetizing, true 
But will I need to get over you? 
Feels like my sun is rising 
Tick tick tick, synchronizing 
Readjusting, organizing me 
Is this fiction reality? 
Bless the uncompromising 
With no shame for advertising 
When my needs go through downsizing 
I need someone to pick up my beat 
My dreams need realizing, candles on sugar icing 
Judgment and harmonizing 
Or it'll end up like before 

Don't, don't, don't mess my hair 
If all you do is fake it 
Don't, don't, don't say you care 
'Cause I could never shake it 
Don't, don't, don't mess with me 
Don't, don't, don't mess with me",Don't Mess with Me
Poets of the Fall,"Silly thoughts of small deeds. 
Everything that once answered to your needs. 
The thoughtless but kind. 
The caring but blind. 
Everything fades away.

Everything fades away, 
Come turning of the tide. 
For your love I'm sorry. 
For your pain, don't worry. 
Everything fades away.

Silhouettes and false leads. 
That which drew you, 
Like a crow to glass beads. 
Secrets spied. 
Wishes sighed. 
Everything fades away.

All I'm saying is don't give up, 
When you're getting so close. 
All I'm saying is don't give up, 
It's the right way you chose.",Everything Fades
Poets of the Fall,"Look in my eyes I'll make you see 
We're drifting aimlessly 
Blind in a world of make believe 

Hear them sing their songs off key n' nod like they agree 
Buying the needs to be discreet 

I've got no hand in matters worldly 
I hardly care at all 
What's going on fails to concern me 
'Cause I'm locked behind my wall 
But you know what drives me out 
Out of my mind oh 

It's whatever makes you see 
Makes you believe 
And forget about the premonition you need to conceive 
The images they sell are Illusion and Dream 
In other words dishonesty 

If I speak ill please, humour me 
Won't rant on endlessly 
Just thought I'd try to make you see 

It doesn't solve a thing to dress it, in a pretty gown 
A stone will not need you to guess if, you're still going to drown 
So you know what drives me out 
Out of my mind, oh 

It's whatever makes you see, makes you believe 
And forget about the premonition you need to conceive 
The images they sell are Illusion & Dream 
In other words dishonesty 

So can you name your demon? 
Understand it's scheming 
I raise my glass and say ""Here's to you"" 

Can you chase your demon? 
Or will it take your freedom? 
I raise my glass and say ""Here's to you"" 

I've got no hand in matters worldly 
I hardly care at all 
What's going on fails to concern me 
'Cause I'm locked behind my wall

Poets of the Fall,"In our headlights
Staring, bleak
Beer cans
Deer's eyes

On the asphalt
Underneath 
Our crushed plans
And my lies

Lonely street signs
Power lines
They keep on flashing
Flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

Your breath
Hot upon my cheek
And we crossed
That line

You made me strong
When I was feeling weak
And we crossed
That one time

Screaming stop signs
Staring wild eyes
Keep on flashing
Flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

The devil grins from ear to ear when he sees the hand he's dealt us
Points at your flaming hair and then we're playin' hide and seek

I can't breathe easy here 'less our trail's gone cold behind us
'til in the john mirror you stare at yourself grown old and weak

We keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night...",Late Goodbye [Theme from Max Payne 2]
Poets of the Fall,"Times when I just can't
Bring myself to say it loud
Afraid that what I'll say comes out somehow awry

That is when it seems
We move in circles day to day
Twist the drama of the play to get us by

And it feels like fear
Like I'll disappear
Gets so hard to steer
Yet I go on
Do we need debate
When it seems too late
Like I bleed but wait
Like nothing's wrong

You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly,
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly,
Where all new wonders will appear

Like the other day
I thought you won't be coming back
I came to realize my lackluster dreams

And among the schemes
And all the tricks we try to play
Only dreams will hold their sway and defy

When it feels like fear",Lift
Poets of the Fall,"I see you crying and it rains
Washing away the bad days
Washing away the pain loss brings
And then you smile though it aches
'Cause you don't believe in mistakes
Just that we made a mess of things

When the deal that you made with love
Is just a one-way street
A one-way street
You feel you'll go overboard
'Cause you're incomplete
Incomplete.

You're not afraid to rely on any way
You can try to learn to make some sense of things
And the way you say we'll get by
With a little laugh we can fly
You know the measure of hope that brings

When the deal that you made with love
Is just a one-way street
A one-way street
You feel you'll go overboard
'Cause you're incomplete
Incomplete.

I hear you laughing like a child
Instead of choking all riled
Instead of staring at shortcomings
Just like the rain when you cried
Washed all the stains of false pride
You'll learn to make the best of things

Have a little more of not enough
More of what is less
But isn't love
Little of same you're dreaming of
That's enough
That's enough

Is just a one-way street

Thank you for using me, flaying me, erasing me

Poets of the Fall,"Fatal velocity, comes on with a rush, overpowering, gives the final push

What never moves, is never still, who has the final word
It holds the world in a single pill, and all life rendered absurd

Kill sweet desire, faith may numb the trial, but can you run all your life
Kill sweet desire, truth will make a liar, you can run but not hide
So run for your life

A false sincerity, a liar and a thief, my pulse and memory, a comfort within grief

What never moves, is never still, who has the final word
It holds the world in a single pill, and all life rendered absurd

Kill sweet desire, faith may numb the trial, but can you run all your life
Kill sweet desire, truth will make a liar, you can run but not hide

Given into this sensation, feel I've run too far
Cannot see beyond emotion, see what the options are
With no faith to trust the notion, I fear I'm losing all control

Rolling my eyes like the stones for the lies, is it really all about the size or just a simple vice...

Oh, and it makes the news
Oh, 'cause it sings the blues

I feel the fire flare alight inside me 
Higher so I can see 
N' aspire to survive this fight in spite of
Liars and travesty
Oh fire

Did you think that I'd blink, that I'd go and take the ink to your control, that I'd sell my soul, and
Does it ring any bells that it sells that we're living out of shells in a shotgun, if we couldn't shoot,
We'd have to run, and finally the cerebral fantasy, better genes and machines, so we can die looking like
We're teens, like snapshot scenes in smithereens...

Oh, and the ones we choose
Oh, witch hunting fools

I feel the fire...

Look there it is in the news again, yeah
There it goes singing the blues again

You get up after you fall

That you'll find nothing underneath the peel

And I get by on this naivete of youth

If what I feel is the only truth
And what I give out will make up what I'll receive
Can I leave behind my naivete of youth?
Will I be crucified for wanting to believe?
I believe

Could you hold us up if I would drag us down?
Resurrect emotions from our past
N' if they had a king for fools would you wear the crown?
Build us up again and make us last

Will we be sorry when the rain is falling again
And what does it matter
If fortune should favor
It's never the final amen

Will I be crucified for wanting to believe?

No appeal
I've been to places, I've seen the tidings,
I bought a book of rules for every coin that I could steal
And so I came to gaze upon the stars, when they were yet unborn
And consequently, tear at my old scars, and the mask I had outworn

So when I'm crying alone
Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone

Grow me a garden of roses
Paint me the colors of sky and rain
Teach me to speak with their voices
Show me the way and I'll try again

I've heard the rumors, started fires, I sowed a sordid lot of plays for keeps for what I need, behold
The demons that I freed
I've tried my best at wearing the hard hat, but healing doesn't seem to happen when you hide away the
Seed
And so I came across the medicine man, and he showed me what I'd forlorn 
For if I'm stayed it happens by my own hand, and my own voice full of scorn

So when I'm crying alone
Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone

Grow me a garden of roses
Paint me the colors of sky and rain
Teach me to speak with their voices
Show me the way and I'll try again

Without you I'm nothing at all
And life has the face of a morbid game
With you nothing seems impossible
It all seems to fit the frame

Poets of the Fall,"Looking at the road that rises up ahead
I thought I'd learned a thing or two
But this is where it's all made new
N' I gotta throw my hands up
I can't go on if I can't stop

Look the leaves are dead
The moments gone, there's no surrender
Forever now unsaid
The words that might've warmed December
'cause it's all inside your head
Like fragments of a dream you remember
So never mind, your clever mind, never mind me

Staring at the ceiling from my bed
I thought I'd earned a chance or few
Thought I'd be paid in due
Time isn't made for waiting
Past isn't worth debating

Look the leaves are dead...

Feeling like a fool again
Just need a new direction
A new beginning , a new beginning
I can't hold back and I can't hold on
It's all about gratification
See me running, see me running

Look the leaves are dead.

Poets of the Fall,"In these days of man made wonders we still bicker over flies
When you come seeking for forgiveness, I'll be forced to choose my side

If I deny you what you're searching, do I do it out of fear
Am I ruling out my reason, killing that which I hold dear

Out of my way I'm running, with an excuse just underway
Reality's so daunting, and I've got no way to explain

Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one

Crying heaven shed your diamonds, diamonds for tears

In the light of recent findings, there's no greater taint than grace
But to relinquish all our bindings, always finds us out of place

If I rested here a while more, would you hold me to your heart
If I knew what it's meant for, would I know to play my part

Out of my way I'm leaving, another excuse before I'll stay

Are these the dead laws

It may be a faded photograph, but I know you care, so don't hide it

If you get lost I'm here to guide you
And I'll give you peace when peace is fragile

Like you've been rubbing yourself all wrong just to be somebody else's genie
Catering to your disasters every need

And find a four leaf clover where you never saw a flower
She's habitually paradoxical, a parallel perpendicular

Barefoot in nightgowns, that's how she dances in the rain
Sundown to sundown, like she was washing 'way her pain

As she is beautiful, she's unpredictable
Damned irresistible, is it plausible to hate her
She is my common sense, revels on decadence
But what's the difference, it's impossible to bait her

She can really be a handful like the brownies that she bakes you
It can be a tad hysterical, but never quite the breakthrough
She's some kind of an epitome, the sea of intranquility

In flimsy nightgowns, barefoot she dances in the rain
Sundown to sundown, like she was washing 'way her pain

Kinda comic how I got tragic

What do you give someone ho has it all

More, just to be sure
I got what I wanted, so naturally I want more
What I paid for, entertain me now
All I want is more, 'cause I like it
Too good to let it go, keep it coming
'cause I want more, 'cause I'm not sure
What I really wanted, so all I want is more

Yeah modesty, her rule now overthrown
Packed her teddybear, so as not to go alone
Left me with my pride to live beneath a stone
For how could an amputee ever pick a bone

So tell me something, isn't this a bit drastic

I dance in tune with what I fear
To do adrenaline
Completely rapt with what I hear
When passion colors everything
The songs I sing, from way out there to deep within
The face I wear behind my grin
The price I've paid for my original sin
Everything, everything, everything

I have a mind for simple things, but things are not of mind to simplify
There's always some loophole technicality you buy into and pay until you die
Money doesn't bring me joy, it's more like a darling dead weight
And I seem to have lost my appetite, it's underrated how we overrate

I dance entangled with my dear

A big fat wet slab of red

And I see that it makes me anti everything
And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin

Revelation leading to my psychosis and inspiration
Digest another hallucination, psychosis by recreation
Happy till the next deterioration, psychosis

For you it's a different notion of music and motion
A dance of lights, a prosaic ocean
A delicate, nearly transparent creation of somebody's soul on the screen
Has caught you in between
Of somebody's life on the stage and somebody's life on the frontpage

Freed with that final incision

Look my heart it's a bird, it needs to sing and to be heard
Not this clockwork precision

And the machine grows idiotic
Who's gonna be its ingenious critic

Everybody loves the perfect solution
To beat the odds against the poorest possible substitution

Leaves you no arguments to trade, you can try the key or you can wait
But the lock will not open

So you're left with sanity to lose, 'cause the machine is a ruse
Another invention to rule them

It's like a fistful of snake eyes, a hand grenade with bye byes
Like a million spent on nothing

It's kinda like a pick in their lock, when you never went ""knock knock, hello, anybody home?
I'm coming in"".
With a touch of foreboding

And the machine grows parasitic

No doubt we'd have collided anyway with the indicted and you raising alarm

What does it matter what I see
If it can't be my design
Tell me where do we draw the line

Make poetry nobody's ever heard
The weight of loneliness stands on your feet
The cage already there around the bird

Before it all falls apart before our love becomes insatiate

Where's the evergreen field
Where's my mother's open arms
Where's my father lionheart

Sleeps in the hallowed ground now
With the autumn's browns leaves
With the one who never grieves

What does tomorrow want with me

Poets of the Fall,"Do you remember standing on a broken field
White crippled wings beating the sky
The harbingers of war with their nature revealed
And our chances flowing by

If I can let the memory heal
I will remember you with me on that field

When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the front line
When I thought that I fought without a cause
You gave me a reason to try

Turn the page I need to see something new
For now my innocence is torn
We cannot linger on this stunted view
Like rabid dogs of war

I will let the memory heal
I will remember you with me on that field

When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the front line
And we fought to believe the impossible 
When I thought that I fought this war alone
We were one with our destinies entwined
When I thought that I fought without a cause
You gave me the reason why

With no-one wearing their real face
It's a whiteout of emotion
And I've only got my brittle bones to break the fall

When the love in letters fade
It's like moving in slow motion
And we're already too late if we arrive at all

And then we're caught up in the arms race
An involuntary addiction
And we're shedding every value our mothers taught

So will you please show me your real face
Draw the line in the horizon
Cos I only need your name to call the reasons why I fought

And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man

Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you

I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch

Trying to reach you so near yet so far
You said I was falling apart
How did you notice from this hole in your heart

I dreamed every second through of every passing day
These dreams were reality
How was I to know that they'd fly away

You
You stole the sun from my day
You always have your own say
You drifted away
You

Waiting for the moment to come
I'm lost in this maze that I've stumbled upon
Dreaming of the beautiful end
These wounds don't heal easy
But I'm trying to mend

Won't walk any further, baby
You're gonna watch me run
Been living in this fairytale
For far too long look what we've become

Point Defiance,"You don't see the way I fell in lee,
And did you ever think I'd know?,
I've contemplated all those past sensations,
That I beat down long ago,

So while you can't wait for me,
My life's all you need,
That's bringing you down,

I know you know that you can't see the way I'm feeling,
And why should I feel this way again?,

Walk with me, I'll take you where you'll see,
I've built a shrine for you and me,
The grass has grown over the weathered stone,
Right where our names used to be,

So while you can't wait for me,
My life's all you need,
That's bringing you down,

I know you know that you can't see the way I'm feeling,
And why should I feel this way again?,

But now I know that things will never be the same,
So, why don't you walk away!,

Point of Grace,"[Chorus]
Faith, Hope and love 
Is more than enough when times get tough 
Faith, hope and love 
Will tunnel through what's in front of you 
If you just trust in faith, hope and love 

There's a lot of things we face 
That seem to pull us down 
There's a lot of tears and pain 
That turn our world around 
Seems the hammer always falls against us 
At our weakest times 

But I know a power that can heal 
The wounds it leaves behind 
It's a stone's throw away 
From anything we may face 

[Chorus] 

There's a lot of hurt and sorrow 
That can cloud the bluest skies 
Still there's hope in tomorrow 
If we just close our eyes 
To every fear we must face 
As w learn to embrace

You can really, really trust 
In faith, hope and love

The fire of the moment
Got to be time for laughing
Got to be time for shouting

There's got to be time

You've got to hold on
Don't let the smallest struggle steal the victory
When you weep in the night
Stay strong
Because joy comes in the morning

The most of your salvation

Deep inside me
With those before me who are gone

Love enough for another start
Love enough in the Father's arms for you
When it feels like the tears won't end
When loneliness is your only friend

She has a song in her heart
And a golden disguise

That it won't be too long
'Til Jesus comes back
To carry her home...

For illusive tomorrows
There will be no more pain

All I have been through,
And how I long to be free
But I learn by her patience that I need her resolve
To wait for the opening of eternity's halls
And I know that in time we will stand side by side
When Jesus comes back receiving his bride

Point of Grace,"Words & music by john mandeville

Lord, I need for you to know
It's only your love, I would die for
So please say you'll never go
When you say that you'll stay

As tears fall from my eyes
Cause hearts fail on all sides
While mine's safe inside

Oh, you're my refuge of love
For so long, I never thought I'd find you
Oh, you're my refuge of love
Love's never been so right
Love's never been so right
'cause I finally found a haven for my heart
In your refuge of love

Guess I believed you'd come and go
Like every other love in my life
And, oh, I tried you so
Yet faithfully, your patience won my willingness
And slowly it became clear to me
That you gave you life
So I could spend mine in...

Point of Grace,"Words and music by joel lindsey & regie hamm

Sometimes we don't see eye to eye
We don't agree, we don't know why
But jesus prayed that we'd be one
So for the sake of god's own son
Can we put away our differences
Lay down our pride
I think it's time we start turning the tide

(chorus)
Shall we gather at the river of forgiveness
Come together at the waters of love
Flowing like a fountain from the mercy giver
Shall we gather at the river

We have all made enemies of
The ones we're called by christ to love
But there's redemption at the riverside
The water's deep, the water's wide
It can wash away our bitterness
The current is strong
I think we've been out in the desert too long

(repeat chorus)

We can wade into the middle
Where the healing waters flow
It only takes a little
To heal a wounded soul
It will only bring us closer
Than we've ever been before
This is just what jesus was praying for

Safely past all the sin that would divide us

A lifetime
You wonder if the waiting will ever end
And the right from the wrong
That you've guarded so long
Is closer that it's ever been

Can sacrifice the treasure of time
And cause you to miss the miracle
That god longs for you to find

There's a love he has for you
There's a heart that he's been saving
There's a joy beyond all measure
That only comes from waiting

And you will find the only love that's true
Is the love he has for you

When you're torn between today
And tomorrow
And holding out for something you
Cannot see
There's a strength you can find
Knowing in god's own time
You'll discover what he meant to be

Been too long chasing selfish dreams
Seeking only what my heart desired
I've drifted so far away it seems
From the truth that set my soul on fire
How many times will it take for me to see
That you're the only love my heart will
Ever need

Take me back, take me back, jesus
Take me back
To where I can know your love
Take me back, take me back, jesus
Take me back
Won't you take me back
Take me back, take me back, jesus
Take me back to where I can feel you love
Take me back, take me back, jesus
Take me back

Lost inside a world of my own choosing
Tried to make it out on my own
Never realized all I'd be losing
I still remember just how it used to be
Lord, forgive my weakness
Come and rescue me

I hide behind my shallowness
I must confess I don't begin to say enough

But I may never quite express

That God blessed me far beyond
What I deserve
I often miss the chance to show my
Faith in Him
By failing to convey what I have seen
And then I wonder while I face eternity
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede
For me

[Chorus:]
What's He gonna say about me
When He weighs the works that
I have done
Against the words that I have
Failed to speak
What's He gonna say about me
When the chaff is sifted from the wheat
Will there be evidence that I believed
What's He gonna say about me

After this lifetime will come
The thankfulness that I forget
I will regret when I see clearly who He is
Then I'll know all I should have said
So I must choose to not neglect
But resurrect the praise for all He is to me
I often miss the chance to show my faith in Him
By failing to convey what I have seen
And then I wonder while I face eternity
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede

Point of Grace,"Consider your needs of the past
When somebody helped but you never asked
Now think of the joy you received
When you reached out to someone else in need

'Cause some days we laugh
Some days we cry
Some days we hold it deep inside
Though each day is a gift from on high

But what I find amazing
The love we give, the love we gain
Amazing
There's so much more that's in Jesus name

Amazing
Sometimes it's hard to see
That it's more blessed to give than receive

Learning from different mistakes
Learning to give instead of just take
But when we all start to blend
We'll be like colors surrounding the sun as it sets

Some days we cry
Some days we hold it deep inside

It's a heart attack a minute
In this life down here on earth
We're all stranded right here in it
Wondering what it's worth
There are always threads of trouble
In this tangled web we weave
But tomorrow may just be ok
See here's what I believe

(chorus)
Better days are on the way my friend
Just a ways on down the line
I believe that just around the bend
Everything's gonna be fine
Better days are just a dream right now
It's like all you do is pray
But the world keeps turning
Bringing us better days

Well the storms won't stop descending
And the rain won't cease to fall
And there ain't no use pretending
Cause it's bound to find us all
Well it's easy to get hopeless
And drive yourself insane
But before you stop and set up shop
In the middle of the pain
Remember

(repeat chorus)

I know you've heard all the platitudes
About attitudes and positive thinking
But time just keep marching on
So just hold, on this too will pass
I know you'll see your face in a smile again

When I said that I would follow
It was with an honest heart
But I didn't fully understand the cost

And there are those today
Who show us what it really means to carry the cross
That only fuels my devotion

Yes, I believe
Though the world rises up against me
I will be faithful

To live so the whole world can see
That yes, I believe

To lose this confidence
For I have found where my assurance lies
It is not in my own power
But in who my savior is
And the truth of this conviction
Makes me shout to the sky

Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

From the beginning the Father
Had a magnificent plan
Revealed through the law and the prophets
To fulfill the redemption of man

You spoke after centuries of silence
In the midst of a still, starry night
And Emmanuel came down among us
And the Father said, 'Let there be light'

Let there be light, let it shine bright
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'
Let there be light

People who walked in great darkness
Gathered from near and afar
Shepherds with flocks in their keeping
Three kings who follow a star

Together the poor and the richest
Witness that Bethlehem night
And the sky full of Angels announcing
The birth of a glorious light

Let there be light, let it shine bright
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'

To praise Him and make His name known
So one day the presence of Jesus
Shines in every heart and every home

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love

Poison,"There's an alley cat slowly walkin' down a dirty street
Watching a cop on the take marching to his city beat
You got Five-fingers Johnny stealing everything in sight
You gotta be bad to be good in the dead of the night
Kick it

You're dancing in fire, baby
When you're takin' it to the streets
Yeah, to the streets
Baby, better watch your back
Fast on your feet

You gotta be bad to be good

What's that?
So I say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
In the dead of the night

When you got nothin', baby
You got nothin' to lose, nothin' to lose
It's an eye for an eye, baby
And a tooth for a tooth
Ain't it the truth?

If you got nine lives, you might survive
'Cause nothing's free on the other side

You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that?
So I say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
In the dead of the night

Wheelin', dealin', cheatin', stealin'
Just to stay alive
They got love for sale, yes, for sale
On the New York subway line
Watch the working girls hanging out
Turning tricks underneath the lights
The lights

One step from Hell
The poor men sell their soul
For a taste of wine

You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that?

Poison,"Two-bit Billy was the coolest guy I ever saw
Didn't want no piece of the pie, he had to take it all
With his guitar slung low hangin' right about the knee
He made the biggest scene, he made the ladies scream,
He had a snakebite smile if you know what I mean

He was livin' for the minute, livin' his life from day to day
If you want it, then take it
He said that's the rules if you want to play

He kept a score of his ladies chalked up on his guitar case
He was a bad-ass rockin', baby, always rollin' out the sounds
Like some freight train come and did a six-string strut and just tore the damn place to the ground

And you can't give in without a fight

Packed in a suitcase by her feet

Wanting it all, taking the fall
Living in the valley of lost souls

Miss Misery come ride me
How I love her company
She did Boston justice
And wronged all the right out of me

So what I'm looking like I'm half dead
A gypsy on the run

Poison,"Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised land
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hand
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids, 
no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried ""Forgive me for 
what I've done there
Cause I never meant the things I did""

And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in

Oh, Lord arise
My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve

And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

[Chorus]

Sometimes I wish to God 
I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road you gotta take me home

I drive by the homeless sleeping on
a cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read 
Jesus Saves
A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win

[Chorus]

You take the high road
And I'll take the low road
Sometimes I wish to God 
I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then

Poison,"We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does
I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife I guess

Well let me tell a story explain the shape I'm in
The girl I had last night had never tasted sin
So I took her to my hotel where I tried to get my way
She said ""Wait a minute, Bret, there's something I must say""

She said If you want to talk that's fine with me
But if you want more you'd better let me be

Cause you can look but you can't touch
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap
You can look but you can't touch
Cause baby I ain't for keeps

Well maybe I'm a bad boy
OK, so I've been around the block
But I am good at one thing
And believe me it ain't talk

She says you must be kidding
I've heard this all before
Other girls might buy it
But I don't, that's for sure

Now wait a minute baby
I don't want you to go
She said ""Don't get no closer
The answer still is no""

So I wined her, dined her, fancy talked
Acted cool and smooth
Got my hands around her shoulder
Two inches from the move

Well I guess I'm about as close as I could be
So I finally made my move, she just said to me

Let me show you something
Mmm, let me set the pace
Slid my hand up her leg
As she slapped me across my face

Poison,"She goes down slow like a shot of gin
She's got an angel's face and a devil's grin
She kinda stared me down as I looked her up
She said ""I'm your poison, now you drink a cup.""

In the heat of the night is when she comes alive
She's gonna push you push you til she's satisfied
I watch the ice melt fast on her red hot lips
She whispers ""If you want to taste my love
why don't you swallow this.""

I see your eyes say no
but your flesh is weak

Well sweet salt shaker
and rattle my bones
One more inch I'm gonna drive it home
Hate to see a pretty little woman all alone

Or are you gonna take yourself a bite
You invite me closer honey

I guess that's what love will do
So drag your heart-stopping mind trip downtown, girl

Poison,"Now pardon my personal demons, child but if you do insist
Sit down and listen to me story awhile, cause it goes something like this

The joint was small but we were having a ball
At a place called the Blue Duck Inn
When I couldn't help but notice her
My future wife walked in

I needed me a dose of her, so I got a little closer
And this is what she said
My old man stands about six foot five
And if he catches you, you're dead

Now I don't need none of that 
giving me the blues
The old man sitting next to me said
Son, let me tell you

Life, you just can't fake it
Love, you gotta make it
Time, you better take it
Lord, ain't that the truth
Hear me out
Your heart will surely feel it
Women come and steal it
Time can only heal it
Lord, ain't that the truth

Saturday night for my gin
Come Sunday morning, I'm asking the good Lord
To forgive me for my sins

Lately my heave-ho get-up-and-go
Wouldn't get me out of bed
I felt like some big wrecking ball
Done hit upside my head

Now I don't need a preacher man
Telling me how to run my life
Until an angel sitting next to me
said son, heed my advice. She said

And I'm knocking on your door

Don't want me here no more

She said stop your pissin' and moanin' and groanin'
Go sleep outside with them dogs
Now honey let me please explain
'Cause I didn't mean you no wrong

I didn't mean to hurt you baby
Wouldn't do that to you
She said bite your lip, now, sweet child
You're the bastard son of a thousand blues

Well my Daddy was gone by the day I was born
And my Mama I have never seen
I was born in the back of a black Cadillac
And raised by a Gypsy queen

And as a child I was hell gone wild
Raised in the eye of a storm
By the time I was ten I was doing time again
'Cause I knew what that gun was for

No, no, no, I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues
No, no, no, Don't know what I'm going to do
No, no, no, I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues
No, no, no, Tell me, mama, what I'm going to do

Ladies have come and ladies have gone
But there's one I remember quite well
Years have gone past, but her memory lasts
But the story I cannot tell

Well I've lived and I've lied
And I've loved and I've tried
To put my soul to good use

Guess I'm shit out of luck
Cause that name, it just stuck
I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues, dig

Could have been a devil's tomb

Blind faith lead me to the sea
Blind faith takes me to a higher ground

Caught between the liars and fools
She spent her days thinking about her life

She was full of dreams and doubts
searching for that one way out
Didn't want to spend the rest of her days being a small town wife

She could visualize the life she wants to lead
But deep inside, she didn't have the heart it takes to leave

For that famous final scene
I believe you know the one
When she falls in love with me

As for you, you've been fakin' your smile
Fillin' your time
On small talk
And cheap wine
Knowing in your heart there was some place
That you'd rather be

So right or wrong
I wrote you this song
To tell you how I feel

Don't put up no fight
You just turn off the lights
Walk over here to me

And lay your body down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah
Oh, let your tears fall down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah

As for me I've lied to, denied to
Fight with, and tried to
Apologize for all my ways
To all the women who were fool enough to fall
In love with me

You played your role
Like a movie
Got your lines for who is
Who was, who would be
Somehow you lost track
While real love slipped away, yeah

So for tonight, just turn off the lights
And let those real feelings show
There's no wrong or right
But until you try
You're never gonna know

And lay your body down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah
Oh, let your tears fall down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah

Before you was mine
I was so lonely
Ain't it a shame
Your heart must feel pain
Before you can get back on your feet again

Ooh so let's draw the blinds
Forget wasted time
And let them old demons die
Take a hold of my hand
Then you'd understand
Why love's worth one more try

And lay your body down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah
Oh, let your tears fall down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah

But like the story says 
This wild-eyed boy is bad

I got a police squad car
Taxi to the local slam 
They said
Son you're gonna pay for what you've done
But I don't give a damn

Just cause I like to drink and dance all night
An alley cat brawl in an old fist fight

Give me no lip boy or I'll kick you in the mouth
Watch you head fly north and your teeth fly south

I gotta face the hangman
Gotta pay for what I done
I gotta face the hangman 
Or by the noose I swing
In the morning sun

Now the judge looked and me and said 
""That boy, he definitely be guilty""
Oh let him swing

I gotta face the hangman
Gotta pay for what I done
I gotta face the hangman 
Or by the noose I swing
In the morning sun

I gotta face the hangman
Gotta pay for what I done
I gotta face the hangman 
Or by the noose I swing

Poison,"I heard a funny thing about me
Lately I've been living on the edge
I won't say that ain't true, 
But who the hell are you
I don't recognize my own face or my friends.

Hey, Mr. Smiley
Read the writing
On the wall
Wake up, Mr. Smiley
Before you don't wake 
Up at all, up at all

Today, I hired me a yes man
He simply agrees with everything I say
He does all my dirty deals
And feeds me my pills
As long as I'm still breathing he gets paid

Yesterday I had a conversation
With all them voices in my head
One said I was no good
One said I should quit
One said to remind myself to get myself a fix

Poison,"Lately boy, your head ain't right
And nothing seems to thrill you
Word on the streets is 
No sex no more 'cause, it'll kill you

You touch, she bites,
You push, she shoves
Then she yells in your ear
No glove, no love
Oh, it ruined the mood
But you know she's right
When the biggest talks and the littlest walks
You better learn how to walk the walk

[Chorus]
As far as I can see
It's really no big mystery 
It's the same old story
No ring, no gets
It ain't the boat you float
It's the motion in the ocean and I quote:
Before you start pumping that feul without your jets
No ring, no gets

This feeling coming over you
It's a variable strength of emotion
You keep thinking your smooth
Start making your move
But your lady starts causin' commotion

You want to round the bases
She knows that's for sure
But Miss Palm and her five sisters
Don't cut it no more
You know tonight you'd like to buy her a kite(?)
But the wind ain't blowing you got that right

[Chorus]

Woman hold the lock
A man's known that for years
You're going up inside to persuade that key
Could bring a man to tears

Your gun is loaded
You got her right in sight
About to pull your trigger
When the girl pulls out the lights

But keep your cool don't make a scene
Cause her ?

Poison,"Well she stepped into the room
Right then she got my eyes
She had an ass like a truck
and two amazing thumping thighs

She's built like no other
Just one big fat mother brick house
So impressed to find those breasts

A little, a little, a little (More for the Bone)
She likes whips and chains and things
She don't need no diamond rings
Couldn't get her through the door
So I did her on the floor

And roll under the sheets
I ask one favor baby
Don't roll on top of me

Just don't get any in your eye
Strap me on a 2 by 4 
So I don't fall in when she wants more

I got excited she threw 
Her ham hocks over me
One the size of a truck
The other the size of a tree

She whispered in my ear
Just more cushion for the pushin', dear
Guess I had to move when she got down to it

A little, a little, a little (more for the bone)
She likes whips and chains and things
She don't need no diamond rings

Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

But that no one could be someone meant for me

So I jump out of my bed
And throw my hands on my head
And scream I need a lover just for me

Maybe if I close my eyes
Everything will be alright
Cause I don't wanna be alone
I know that baby

And do what's only right

Most of you even scared to stand by them

Well here's a taste
Straight from the studio known for the Ghetto Bass
Made to invite, no sittin' down
So get up and dance all night

Now dance 'cause I said so
Bust a move and go with the flow

And wave 'em like ya just don't care!
And if you're ready to rock with JT and the Clan, 
Lemme hear ya say, aw yeah!

Verse 1:  JT Money
JT, wreckin' shit like a drunk driver
The Bitch-izer's richer and wiser
Niggas camouflage to be large like the great one
Talkin' shit?  Oh, that's a mistake, son!
'Cause I'm on track like a train
Puttin' niggas in pain, who think they can hang
With the likes of the Money Man
I'm from the Clan; I leave your head spinnin' like a fan
So spread your hustle, we can go off the muscle
Brothers talk shit, but still don't want to tussle
With the Clan's warrior!
Make a sad story o' whoever's in the section, 
'Cause all you get is wrecked, son
If you don't know what you're in for,
Pay attention as I mention the info
Or you'll get slapped like a hoe
I'm from the bottom, niggas!  Act like you know!

Verse 2:  JT Money
Save the beef for the patty; I don't rap for the weak
The Poison Clan's mack daddy ain't your speed
I get respect to the maximum, some be actin' dumb
They're not down with the Poison, so I'm taxin' 'em
Eatin' 'em up, like a gyro sandwich
They're never Poison Clan 'cause they do zero damage
JT Money's the man you can never predict
I'm crusin' while suckas gettin' sea-sick
Now stuff like this you can't resist nowadays
Poison is power, and power pays
So I choose to be Poisonous
You can never pose a threat if you put your boys in this
But rather though, you'll tell your kids a story of
JT, the Poison Clan warrior
I'm never lost in the source 'cause I'm the boss
Hot like the devil but cool as Jack Frost
And I fly niggas' head like a frisbee
You just seen a rough nigga gettin' busy

Chorus

Motherfuckers on ropes and still can't hang with me
The mack daddy's back on track and it's plain to see
I'm one of the best out, I'm waitin' the next 'bout
Never fakin' makin' the opposite sex shout
Niggas act hard when they know they soft 
Pull a switch on your back and turn yo' ass off
'Cause the shit y'all kickin' ain't hittin'
The shit I kick kick ass; I ain't bullshittin'
I'm on a rampage to do damage
Eat you like a sandwich, 'cause you can't manage
Niggas try to get fly, so then I wreck 'em
Kick 'em in the rectum, and then reject 'em
I make Hell raise, kick like a 12-gauge
Make you feel like you're trapped in a steel cage
Niggas kickin' nursery rhymes and weak fables
I kick shit like I'm walkin' through a horse stable
Gettin' shit on my steel-toe, but still chilled, though
My foot'll be up yo' ass like a dildo
So don't be next, black

Look in my brain see the hate, its pure,
Lost direction sold my mind,
Erase all thoughts to keep hate pure,
Following the mindless driven by hate,
I know what's coming and I can't wait,
Look me in the eyes and I'll be gone.





",Pure Hate
Poison Idea,"

Take frustrations out on yourself,
Think you've hurt all, there's no one else,
Put your head through a window,
Then hold it high and let the blood flow,
Why do you drink until you pass out face first in front of me?
Then crawl up and bleed all over my new shirt,
Self Abuse,
In a cold dark alley, the figure stands,
Abuseing himself, dripping in his hands,
He say's he's punishing his peers around him,
Watch this never was, turn has been,
I hope someday you find your place,
With cigarette burns on your face,
If you want attention, don't act insane,
Cause you're addicted to the pain,
Rip the stitches out with your teeth,
And you have the nerve to judge others?
Self abuse.





",Self Abuse
Poison Idea,"Stand on both feet, hold my own,
No gun, no way to make a mark,

I might be mad about the way things are turning out,
You might be dead, there's one way out

Look to see where you've been from standing at the start again,
Stand up backwards, that's a fact, who's gonna follow your attack,
Try to keep what you've got, even if it's not a lot,
Everyday people die and starve but not you,
Crazy, mixed up, screwed up, its all falling apart real fast,
The next thing you hear might be an atomic blast,
Were going straight downhill from here,
Businessmen, politicans, government, stacks it up,
It's vital, punks, radicals, tear it down,
Look to see where we've been from standing at the start again,
Don't belive ehat you read,
Crazy, mixed up, screwed up, its falling apart real fast,
Have fun this time around because it might be the last,
This thing called progress makes me sick.





",This Thing Called Progress
Poison Idea,"

Fuck you!

Do this, don't do that
Breaking rules is where it's at
And that's the way it's gonna stay
If you don't wanna try
You better have a reason why

Pass the laws obey by it
Break the rules don't give a shit
I only have one commandment
Destroy to create, build a new
Smash the hate

What are they for?
Why were rules made?
To be broken!

Who's to blame
For all your flaws?
Make abortion outlawed
And put prayer back in school
The truth is as clear as a cespool
I say piss on all your fucking rules
From where I stand
The inside view of a promised land
Is the inside view of a garbage can
I'll bite the hand that feeds me shit
I am getting sick of the taste of it

What are they for?
Why were rules made?
To be broken!

Leave the police bleeding
Leave the churches smoking
And your rules leave them
Out in the street because
Your rules were made to be broken






",Made to Be Broken

Bottle, bottle, on the wall, who's the drunkest of us all?
Set yourself up for the fall, who's a slave to alcohol,
I know a place where you can go, you'll probably see no one that you know,
A few minutes will make you think you probably need another drink.
They said that I had a disease, I asked them, ""What?"" if they please,
I asked them what the fuck they meant,
Victim of the six percent,
Now I'm so ashamed of it,
I guess it's time that I quit.
I saw a friend the other day, getting out of N.A.
He was looking really good, that made me think of myself,
I care about my worthless friends, don't like to see them kill themselves,
Get so strung out they lose all hope, why do you think they call it dope?
Trembling hands, blooodshot eyes, propose a toast to my demise.
God gave me this liver,
I didn't know he was an indian giver.









",A.A.
Poison Idea,"So this is why people kill themselves, I don't care anymore.
How can I smile in a world of corruption, hate, death and self-destruction.
It's in my heart, in my mind, with me all the time,
So ask the man who wrote this song, ask him what he thinks is wrong.
So I look around me and sigh, then kiss my ass goodbye

Almost got what I wanted, almost got what I needed,
Tried to get it from you, you act so conceited,
So hey mom, come here, 'cause I really like it there,
I like to feel like a man, piss and shit when I can,
Pride on my shoulder with a chip on the other,
Target excites, I got both my hands on her thighs.









",Don't Like It Here
Poison Idea,"


Freedom's just a word to those who give in,
Or a state of mind for those who put out,
Everything they have for an absence,
Or another word for no oppression,
Your sterile, fake community means un-civil liberty,
But it's out there, if you want it,
A change, a social change, is out there, if you want it.
Street politics are an important part of life,
You gotta know something about it if you don't want to die,
But if you die you say it's not gonna matter,
Cause all your life, it was handed to you on a platter.
Your sterile, fake community means un-civil liverty,
But it's out there, if you want it.
Money, happiness, freedom, a saviour, if you want it.
So go and die for whatever you don't believe in.
From the day that I was born,
Stars and stripes, a uniform,
Permanently rearrange,
Don't you sense a certain change?
A message to all, not just some,
Sprayed on the wall, legalize freedom
Hold your ground, keep it down, don't sell yourself short
Subvert? Don't vote? Do I have a right to bitch?
Does it count?









",Legalize Freedom

You might have more than me,
I'm not so blind I can't see,
The rich getting richer, who says that it has to be?
Money talks, money screams,
Middle class lies, Amerikan dreams,
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer,
Who says it has to be.









",Rich Get Richer
Poison Idea,"


I want to be dominated, have my masculinity deflated,
Push me around a little more, that way I respect you more,
When it's all said and done, what a strange idea of fun,
Lay me on my back, I'm just a rubber husband.
My heart's such an open sore, how can I trust you any more,
Slap my face, pull my hair, love me, tell me you care.









",Rubber Husband

Here it comes again, a thorn in my side, a set of rules or a set up,
Give me grief and run it in just by the tone of your voice,
Something pained the side of me, I can't figure out.
All the pressures the day inflicts,
All the pain that makes that clock inside your heart tick.
Something pained the side of me, I can't figure it out.
Destroying me by the tone of your voice
Why can't you see that you're losing me, putting me in misery.

The holy ghost, all rolled up into one

This town's views are old
This town's grey and cold
This place to the west
This place I like the best
This place reeks of death
I used to think that the hills were full
Of rich little girls and their cheap little games,
Until one night something happened, occurred,

Out with the old, in with the new
Change my appearance/sound/attitude to impress you
Do everything just one way
But change my mind day to day
It's so predictable it will never happen again
Correct my mistakes then I rip off a friend
Time is short, it goes too fast
Think what you've done in the past
All those things that have happened to you
And all the things you are gonna go through
It's so typical but what's done is done
I keep playing my games and what hurts is fun
Emotions spill just like wine
Tears flow in one straight line
Hearts break, it's no mistake
It's a shallow truth, I can see you're fake
Now it's time to rap my rhyme, rock it into overtime
But it's the wrong way to go. Isn't that just typical?

You realize your facin' your last hours on this planet, our planet
No compromise there's nothin' worse than thinkin we don't kick ass
Pulverize cause we don't even care if you know where you went wrong

This time we're not takin' any shit
We're fuckin' through with it
You'll be the one to pay and pay good, you never thought that you would

Blown away by the shear brutality we dished you
You're free to say you'll never turn your back on another, no other
Just throw away the years of trust in people that you've saved up
And who will pay the price for every hardship that you've went through, been done to?

This time you're not takin' any shit
You're fuckin' through with it
They'll be the ones to pay and pay good never thought that they would

This time you'll find blood on your hands
Next time you'll find blood on your lines
They're creepin' up around you
They're comin' out to find you
And your business is their business
Make room on your shoulders

This time you're not takin' any shit

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Take my hand and show me how
To spin around this floor;
I don't know how!
Come unlearn me
Everything I've ever learned before
I'm ready now

'cause I've danced with romeos and gigolos
Philosophers and slackers
Vagabonds and cambridge dons
The king of cool's heir apparent
Infidels and jezebels
And poets with no talent
But they've never shone
On the dark side of my moon

now that you've warmed me
I never want to be that cold again
Cold may be easy, but
Nothing comes of nothing in the end
Take my hand and lead me
Where the music is alive;
I think you can
You've got golden lips
And a whole lifetime in your eyes;
We don't need no plan
Come and ask me
If I want to dance with you;
I think you will
And when a thousand moons
Have spun around this earth of ours
We'll be dancing still

'cause I've danced with romeos and gigolos
Philosophers and slackers
Vagabonds and cambridge dons
The king of cool's heir apparent
Infidels and jezebels
And poets with no talent
But they've never shone
On the dark side of my moon",Dark Side
Polly Paulusma,"Can I keep my head
When all around me are losing theirs?
Can I keep my secrets close?
Can I hold my course in this tiny vessel steady?
Will I reach the farthest coast?
It's rolling away from me
As far as the eye can see
But while this journey's long, it's joyful
'cause you are here with me

I've been living for tomorrow
Forgot to live today
This sweet life is only borrowed
Got to give it back some day

can I feed this beast
With everything I've got and more?
Who will suffer if I don't?
Who's the puppetmaster
Pulling me towards the shore?
Do I want to cut the ropes?

Polly Paulusma,"In the sky I see angels flying all over town
They've got names in their pockets
Of lovers lost and found
If I send you my angel
Would you send yours to me?
If our angels collide in the sky
You'll say it was meant to be...

...and days blank like they bleached them
And nights outline air like static on the phone
And you say that you feel them
But the words you picked so carefully
Keep coming out all wrong
So I'll write them in light
And I'll carve them in stone;
I was made for loving you
I was put on this sweet earth to
I was made to love you

in the air I hear gunfire
Going off in the hills
Clocks are ticking
The battle is nearing
I'm fending them off with these pills
If you're stuck on the front line
Would you charm your way out?
You might like the idea of the kill
But you don't know what dying's about...

They've got drugs in their pockets
To keep us on the ground
I won't send you my angel;

Spit the pills out
Feed fuel to your fear
And fly away with me

Would you do it all again?

With a good strong base
And a cork that fits it
No label, no maker's mark

And plain disappointment
In until I've almost filled it

I'll need a boat with a good strong sail
To weather all the storms and the gales

Out into the deep blue sea
And then I'll sail away
I'll throw that bottle out so far, it can't hurt me

one day, I'll take some canvas
With a good strong seam and a hot air burner
A basket, some sandbags and rope
And I'll float above the earth
In my balloon of steam
Drifting further and further
Over plains and mountain slopes

I'll fly 'til I find the deepest lake
A volcano about to awake
I'll grab that bottle by the neck
And say my prayers...

and then I'll hurl that bottle
Down into the deep ravine
I'll never hear it hit the ground
I'll throw that bottle down
So far it can't hurt me
One day, one day...

one day I'll build a rocket
With a thick blunt nose and a megatonne engine
A window to look at the moon
And I'll burn through the stratosphere
With fire in my tail, a comet ascending
'til I float in weightless gloom
I won't turn back 'til I see a lunar plains
The detail of the rugged terrain
I'll grab that bottle full of pain
And say my prayers...

Down onto the arid sea
And then I'll fly away
I'll hurl that bottle down

There was you and me and some drunkards
In a black london taxi cab

There's a place where time stands still;
Quicken your pace there
Put your foot down, driver, get us over the hill,""

though I built up a wall around me
You just blew it down
And mother always told me
That you'd come and dig me out of here
Somehow

she told me:
""somewhere, over the hill
There's a place where time stands still;
Follow your fate there
But don't rush it, you've got time
To get over the hill...""

climbing higher, got no place to rest
I'm just clijmbing higher
Aiming for the mountain crest
It's up there, the panacea
Come and see for yourself
I've got nothing for you
But kisses and a pocketful of rye
But I see our unborn children
In the apple of your eye

A flimsy disguise covered the devil who sang from a songsheet of how modern life's a bore.
In his choir boys' attire he sang me the life to which good girls aspire.
Where many white coats give us pills to tame the horses that stamp on our floors and pills for when the horses had bolted out the door.

Now the house is on fire, the rats are all screaming the horses are tired. 
They think they're still dreaming ‘cause the barn doors are open, the crossbar is hanging in the wind.
So the devils sing tired, “Oh just look at what you're doing,”

She moves in secret…
Days gone by I thought I had it all - filed in little boxes. 
Now I find I never had control, I just took little chances to move.

Now the devil's downstream, he's singing to someone, my horses are free.
They answer to no one, unbridled, untethered, they roam on the unmarked land.
In my house there's a calm, a peace has descended, no need for alarm.
It's as she intended, I'm through with trying to fight the things I don't understand. 
Accept my sweet surrender to the greater, better plan. 
It's hard to explain, I don't like hanging onto reins in my hands all the time.
I'm running out of trails where paths don't lead to where I need to get to every time.

My tune-cut will last generations long
And it will be one to remember me by

empires may fall
And the maps might change
The oceans may boil in a fit of rage!
But folks will be whistling a tune of mine

Trunkless, legs that sneer of cold command
Don't you need something to remember me by?

With their swords drawn fast
And fuelled by love, round the world they'll fly

They're these sweet rotting memories
That keep you alive

Nitrogen pink, please
Throw me a moment just to
Get my composure and to
Stamp on a fly

And the boys had they're pearls
And the girls had to backs
And everybody was laughing at you
Singing isn't it, isn't it, isn't it
Such a funny old world the way tragedy strikes

Nitrogen Pink please throw me a moment just to
Get my composure and to stamp on a fly

And the blind man was seeing clouds all grey
Until the weather man blew his rain away
And nobody, nobody, nobody make a sound

Nitrogen pink and a pill for my breakfast
And a bag full of ketchup that he spilt on his tie
Nitrogen pink for the unwritten bible
About this mad mad days survival
Till he kicked it up in the flames

And all the education daddy, it never paid
Because the fat man took my innocence away
And I though and I thought and I thought
You said all the streets were paved with gold

Nitrogen pink for the real captain red beard
For the unlikely pianist, the sad and the gay
Nitrogen pink for the man in the corner
For the pig in the slaughter house
The sweet melody

Played slot machines got so rich then we lost it
Found a hole in my pocket
Crack a smile and we're okay

That long drive home
Nothing much ever after
Nothing hurts me more than laughter

Show your colors black and blue
Make another crupper on the sofa

Hate to pry now it's forgotten
Feeling strange and looking rotten
Fighting like a soldier over skinny jeans and pick'n' mix

Fickle like a fruit machine
Playing with the cruise ship queen
Taking all his apples
And then going to play hide and seek

Please don't let that rat man take me

Polly Scattergood,"I try not to let my insecurities
Dictate who I am, and who I want to be.
I gave you all my words, and my words are my soul.
So, please try to be kind, if you are in control.
Because
Time takes, time takes, times takes, time takes many tears away.

If I had some elegance, some airs or grace,
Or if I had buttons made of silver, 
Or tops made of lace.
Then, I'd be that girl you want.
I'd ooze with charm.
And I'd have diamonds on my fingers, and you on my arm.
But 
Time takes, time takes, times takes, time takes many tears away.

Everybody seems to just turn a blind eye
On the 159 to Brixton, when a blonde girl cries,
And so, I will always be that girl that you never quite kissed,
And I've ribbons on my fingers and cuts on my wrist.
Because
Time takes, time takes, times takes, time takes many tears away.

If I was brave enough I'd get onto my knees,
And I would ask for you to try again
To love me please.
Because I have never felt that unconditionally
And learning takes some time but don't give up on me.
'Cause time takes, time takes, times takes, time takes many tears away.

Time takes, time takes, time takes courage!
And time, time takes many tears away.

Black and blue my petals fall on broken glass.
Please, teach me how to love and to forget the past.
Because tiny steps I take each day, but most days I crawl.
Please, try to be kind because I often fall.

And you walk, wet streets
Tryin' to remember
All the wild breezes
In your mem'ry ever.

When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'

And all the girls walk by 
Dressed up for each other

Polo Montañez,"Cuando amanece si ti no es como tenerte cerca
Nada es igual, nada me interesa
No hay luna, no hay sol, lucero ni estrella
Si hasta el aire que respiro siento que me quema

Cuando amanece sin ti la vida me parece poco
Porque sin tu amor yo me vuelvo loco
Quiero oír tu voz, verme en tu mirada
Porque sin tu amor la vida no es nada
Porque sin tu amor la vida no es nada

La vida es, sin ti, un barco a la deriva
Oye, coge una pistola y mátame
(Pum)
¿Para qué quiero la vida?
De tanto amor que yo le di

Mira como se le olvida, mira
Por eso ven, ven pero ven, ven otra vez
Vuelve enseguida, oye
Y si no vas a volver a mí, no me lo digas
No me lo digas, no lo digas que

Las fuerzas de mi corazón todavía no
La borro totalmente ella siempre está
Presente como ahora en esta canción
Incontables son las veces que he tratado de
Olvidarla y no he logrado arrancarla ni un segundo
De mi mente porque ella sabe todo mi pasado me
Conoce demasiado

Y es posible que por eso se aproveche porque yo
En el amor soy un idiota que ha sufrido mil
Derrotas, que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme
Pero ella casi siempre se aprovecha unas veces me
Desprecia y otras veces lo hace para entretenerme
Y es así

Hoy recuerdo la canción que le hice un
Día y en el fondo no sabía que eso
Era malo para mí poco a poco fui cayendo en
Un abismo siempre me pasó lo mismo nadie
Sabe lo que yo sufrí

Fui una víctima total de sus antojos pero
Un día abrí los ojos y con rabia la
Arranqué de mi memoria poco a poco fui
Saliendo hacia adelante y en los brazos de otra
Amante pude terminar al fin con esta historia

Porque yo en el amor soy un idiota que ha sufrido
Mil derrotas, que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme
Pero ella casi siempre aprovechaba y si
Algún día me besaba, eso era
Sólo para entretenerme y es así

Todo fue así,así mismo fue, todo
Fue por ella yo la quería yo la adoraba
Pero tenía que aborrecerla todo fue

Pomeroy,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

Pomeroy,"Music is a world within itself 
With a language we all understand 
With an equal opportunity 
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands 
But just because a record has a groove 
Don't make it in the groove

When the people start to move 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
Music knows it is and always will 
Be one of the things that life just won't quit 
But here are some of music's pioneers

Poncho Sanchez,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Cold Sweat/Funky Broadway

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

And bathes the leaves
Of memories

A love lost long ago

Crassness of youth
Concluding only half of the truth
Exuding only one small percent
Of what I surely felt for you

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.

Poncho Sanchez,"One early morning, as I was walking
I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home, to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I don't remember just how I started
I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn't mean to take it further

One mint julep was the cause of it all
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

A mint julep, a mint julep

I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey

Pooca Leroy,"[Trae]
I find myself in a daze, sitting watching time fly on by
I tried to catch a grip, but somehow we keep moving on by
We came a long way, from playing hide-and-seek on the block
To bleeding corners on the daily, barely missing the cops
We turned to grown men, quicker than the blink of an eye
Some of us made it some of us didn't, but still we got by
What about the good times, ain't too many but I remember
Stadium Bowl, the rest of the clubs wouldn't let us in 'em
We was young, and plus our pants sag like Dubs
But we ain't care, cause half of the parking lot knew who we was
We came from riding on a bike, and graduated to a Houpe
Six deep with a grey cassette, trying to swang banging Screw
That was the days, but now we only riding with guns
Only understanding I got, is multiplying my funds
And moving slow in a drop, pass bops so grimey
Missing better days, hoping they could come and find me

[Hook]
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from playing tag, to me running from the cops
Went from Tunker Toys, me swanging in a drop
Flying pass bops
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from shooting water, to me loading up a glock
I came from the gutter, trying to make it to the top
Shit don't stop

[Jay'Ton]
I remember kicking it, with my niggaz in Middle School
In the hall full time, fuck class and all the rules
Late night, I was with the O.G.'s on the block
Curfew broke, but I was trying to stack me a knot
With my nigga Raw-C, Nick and the T-Head
Can't forget about the J2, and blocks we bled
Playing tackle football, while we on the concrete
In the house, imitating everybody we can beat
From the West to the North, with my nigga Pyrex
On the hunt for some bops, roaming through the projects
When I turned 16, Trae bought me a car
Four 15's, so the hood know who we are
Jay walking, so you know I'm walking it fly
T-shirt creased up, fuck a suit and a tie
Them was the days, I'll probably never see him again
So my main focus now, is for me stacking my ends

[Boss]
I was raised back in the 80's, I can tell ya bout the Smurfs
We was kids, we done traded our nurse for hard work
I can go back in the day, to playing get like me
In the hood looking for trouble, can you hit like me
I was a youngster in the street life, bailing through the street lights
First pair of G-Nike's, ask a nigga what that G like
I remember playing curve ball, and soccer
They got most of my homies chained up, in 5-by-7 lockers
The days ain't the same, in '79
Nigga was cool in '94, but now everybody walk in a shady line
25 years of keeping it real, wasn't hard for me
Living for the moment, to hit the gates for the Lord to see

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I done came a long way, from cutting class
No more ducking hall monitors, now the FED's on my ass
Grown man shit Joseph Wayne McVey, I never thought I would say
That a state jail or prison, is a place I'd have to stay
I remember Saturday morning, cartoons and basketball
Half of the niggaz I was hooping with, in a casket y'all
The streets, is a graveyard
187's every second, please watch over my days Lord
I'm nothing but a Christian, I'm down with Jehovah
But this day in time, you ain't gon make it if you ain't a soldier
So God forgive me because I'm strapped, somebody might try to do me
The real world ain't like my block, this shit it like a movie
Make me wanna travel back in time, like Michael J. Fox
To when all my people was living, and it was love on the block
But ain't nothing but the future, bout to take place
It'll never be 1989 again, so nigga fuck friends

Pooh,"E io dovrei comprendere
Se tu da un po' non mi vuoi
Non avrei mai capito te
Ma da capire cosa c'è

Dovrei tornare a casa e poi
Se il fiato ce la fa
Parlarti del mio mondo
Fuori dei miei pensieri
Poi scoprire che vuoi dormire
Che non mi senti più

E io dovrei, ma spiegami
Contro di me che cos'hai
Come se io non fossi io
Mi dici che te ne vai

Son quello che respira piano
Per non svegliare te
Che nel silenzio
Fu felice di aspettare
Che il tuo gioco diventasse amore
Che una donna diventassi tu

Noi due nel mondo e nell'anima
La verità siamo noi
Basta così e guardami
Chi sono io tu lo sai

Noi due nel mondo e nell'anima

Time to easyated and straight get sucked

Tina was a young ass freak
Start suckin' on my balls and my knees got weak
Nutted in the throat, she couldn't get with it
Took it out her mouth and slapped herself with it

It ain't the best I've ever had but baby, you're good

Grabbed her on the phone, ""Is it cool today'""

Bitch started mumblin', finally said maybe
Let a ho meet a tone, ""Alright then, baby""

Pooh-Man,"Woke up in the morning, threw on my black suit
Time to pay respects to a player from my crew
He got caught up and paid with his life
Slipping on the block on the late night
Now everybody's at his funeral with tears in their eyes
Wonder why my homie had to die
Just another one of my dead friends
And all that's on my mind is getting revenge
Kissed my playa on his cheek
And whispered in his ear ""I love you and rest in peace""
But for me, the funk is on
I'm strapped with my chrome from dusk til dawn
And you can run but you can't hide, fell me?
So when you get your first glance, you'd best to kill me
Cause I'm out to gets you, pranksta
And you know you can't fade a gangsta

They try to tell me revenge is the wrong way
But that ain't what my comrades would say
And if it was Pooh, laying in the casket
Somebody would be getting they punk ass blasted
I'm riding strapped in the LTD
Ready to put some punks to sleep
Tears filled Antione's eyes
As he thinks of the way my homie died
AK's across my lap
And it's on with the mini 14 in the back
The Angel of Death's on a mission
I want your life nigga, fuck sqaushing shit
And as far as the toll goes
Nigga you can talk to these motherfucking bullet holes
Now the deuce is out to hang ya
And we ain't shit but gangstas

Now we know for sure who pulled the trigga
Fake-ass nigga
So we kicked in his mom's door at home
And find her old ass there all alone
She gave up his number and all
So I gave his mark ass a call
Look punk, we got your momma
And she'll be dead on arrival if you don't cut the drama
You killed my partner so I gots to kill you
And I'm a do what I have to
This wrinkled-up bitch, you'll find her in a ditch
If your ass don't get here quick
I'm getting tired of your drama
Now ask yourself nigga, do you love your momma?

Once upon a time  upon the earth
Many say we're cursed
But those who are black are that of first
Ever to exist upon the planet
Let me speak more candid
I'm here to give a greater understanding
Peace was the flow of the universe
So shut your bible stop tellin' lies that you were first

T'cha, T'cha! What about these students lackin' lessons

Posse, friends God, tend to the teacher
Stammered at me concept, teacher mosh it up, right
PRT p-osse, boy ghetto with philosophers
All can't get enough of this, drummer common insight, check
Here comes the teacher with another funky new
radical, butt-naked booty stinkin form of thinkin
Off an on step, concept, tell em Culture Freedom
Shall I sex this? (Well God it's sexy!)
This this step steppers come and steppers swingin
Most blacks back back-up what the hell we bringin
G-fine nearly singin, my rhythm hit the roof!!
This one's dedicated to the CISI missing youth, cause
This hit the teacher with another style of mashin up
a damn dance, jams get, jammed by the PRT p-osse
(and) Tone can I get a sound check, well can I start this
(Yo Wise, it's started)
You know I look into the mirror see myself and then
I always often say... ""Hot damn I'm great""

Chorus: repeat two lines 3X

Let's be realistic... (you are the best) [ahh yeah] hot damn I'm great

See me forgetting on the top of every set
Heard about million and one of my songs, my favorite's Holy Intellect
Check Wise on the rise I emerge from slum
Come one come all see, the teacher heal the dumb
Cause, this hit the teacher givin birth to a ghetto style
display, most poor people of the planet
can relate to, poverty in a song
Conquered and divided, tricked and undecided
Black people in oppresion, so the old ones tell about it
So when I forget ya what I think ya need to know
Understanding jamming mind and Culture Freedom tell ya so
No black no white, cause black be's first
Son of man, take a stand, for black children of the earth
Just, just check out teacher and the way that I evolved
Since last time, I'm truly perfection
But, don't balance this with the other LP
For the last rhymes, cause there's no connection
If I was the DJ Father Sha he'd come and tell em what I'd say...
""Hot damn I'm great""

Chorus: repeat two lines 4X

See draw the clear picture of the teacher teachin this
It's, sort of smooth, roughness
Plus this flow go more miles back
God's gotta be that of a leader in this thing called rap
Cause, this hit the teacher on the roads often travelled
by the multitude, Culture Freedom knows it best
Some of them got a problem with the Gods in the house
Cause we don't sleep, traitor interpretate this
Allah equal God equal He with supreme qualities
You best believe God's real and
If it's God Sha, it's gotta be
(""Tribe... called... P... R... T-T..."")
Culture Free, Father Sha, and me, cause
This hit the teacher on a whole nother level
with a clear scope, and range on things hang
out by the speaker if you're weak or come and eat
From the strong song, that's if you are what you eat
Never will I teach ya that of poison and disguise it
with a beat, the tree of life be's me
Sweet chariot, come fi carry me home, and I pray...

They say I'm just too complicated
They ask me what my age
Then I have no recollection
They ask me ""what religion?""
But religions not important 
Principle, culture, nation
Civil law and order
I'm checking
I self lord and the P-are-T P-ossee see it

For something I created
Maker and the owner of the style

About the purified words, ways, actions

Praise for the days when I couldn't get paid
In the fix on the mix in the damn projects
Cracks for the blacks but I couldn't sell that
Even though blacks couldn't get jobs and shit
Hit after hit from the Sugarhill Gang
Hear a Pow Wow, hear a Big Bank Hank
It was strange, I was broke but I still got the record
Even though I was poor and about butt naked
Rats in my front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley running styles for the crack
It was ill on the real, I be still bugging off it
In the ways I will walk it so today I can talk it
It's a shame how the games in the ghetto get played
On the cracks they paid for the tricks they laid
I'm afraid for the youth in this time we're living in
Just about 13 on the scene scrambling
Gambling small-time, apologize nice
I'm about to roll 10 7's for the crap I rolled twice
Rough business, it's a rich mon time
When you ain't got the loot, you resort to the crime
From the cess house, the youth house, the jail house, the Cult house
Where I perfected these skills I be doggin
Love to teach the facts but the brothers in the back
Can't see what I'm saying cause the blunt smoke is foggin
Still I proceed with degrees of the wisdom
Cause this shit's thick, it kicks and I know it
Lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto

From ghetto to ghetto, from project to project
Bookbag of lessons but I ain't have dough yet
From knowledge to wisdom, from wisdom to see
And understand me if you don't dance, G
It's a god in the house, it's a god in the house
And I'm godding it out, and I'm godding it out
I've come a long way, the strong way, the wrong way, I lived it
The right way, you might say, I got it, I'll give it
But praise for the days when I used to be tramp
And had to freeload of my Earth's food stamps
Til I stopped, paused, start the pop's stores
It was ill on the real, but who's to die for us?
Say that I rock my own community
Ain't a damn thing owned by the you or the me
It's Koreans I be seeing on the neighborhood corners
With the guns and the stores and love the ??? owners
So beg my parton, peace Natasha Harton
See I won't forget, I know for shit's starting
From my way to LA, from JA to UK
I am who I am, I say what I say
I gots no time to love a slave trader
Cause according to the constitution, they'll always hate us
Play this, say this, and say it like I said it
Cause a magazine edit can get your ass beheaded
I'm thorough breaded, black slave dreaded
The shit that y'all doing, I already did it!
But lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto

Praise for the days when I used to be trife
With a lack of understanding anything about life
So thanks to Malcom, Martin, Wylee Ferartin
Father Allah talk the talk that I'm starting
Peace to Elijah, we can't forget about ya
Teaching us how ta, get up out the
Project complex caves
Another damn rave for the damn ex-slave
My ghetto noise ringing from a project hallway
Don't want to hear my mom say ""Blacks have come a long way""
How can she see that when we haven't eaten all day
Haven't had a job since the ending of the slave trade
Then they give us church, attempt to try and ease this
But I check it out, had to learn about Jesus
Told em he was black and they called me a hater
Then he's on the church wall, yeah like a slave trader
Something real funny's going on boy I'll tell ya
Send you up sell ya, free ya try to kill ya
Martin taught me much when he simply tried to love em
Brother all about peace but the devils had to snuff him, but

",Dreadful Day
Poor Righteous Teachers,"Yo for truly, we representing for the love of this (this is a love story)
Yeah, This one is dedicated to all my niggaz in central New Jerusalem
All the brothers who picked up that ring after I put it down
And took Miss Ghetto to be their unlawfully wedded wives
Poor Righteous Teachers representing the nine

It's like that and you don't stop
She's like cocaine, running around my brain
Miss Ghetto be like cocaine, running around your brain

I know some crack slingers, crack slingers and cracker shankers
They soldier-train us, teaching their kids to murder strangers
They live for danger, they express the ""I a Nigga""
Miss Ghetto got 'em dreaming of loot and Swiss bankers
The finest weapons, packing tri-action Smith and Wessons
Unlike the 80's, ladies packing 680's(?)
The shit is crazy, but it's like the ghetto babies
They gotta eat, so the streets provide the gravy
I thought that maybe I could show them that other way G
of Gods and Earths, resurrected through mental birth
From death to life, teaching niggas of every type
The wrongs and rights, to put an end to living trife
The black man is God, the 12th jewel is thirteen
The pursuit of it can make savages out of kings
Cause blush, to live with these niggas is in a rush
In God they trust, so they sell crack to us
Lust for what whitey got and whitey has
Can see your ass on pursuit to get cash
To look thrash, to driving the latest jags
To rock rags made by Italian fags
See, I never meant to fall in love with this shit
But Miss Ghetto you's a slut so I'm divorcing you bitch
Bust it

Chorus:
I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again 
First chance I get to bounce world life I'm bouncing (x2)

She's like cocaine running around my brain
(No matter how much loot I get I'm staying in the projects) (x2)

Down in my gutter
Just like others there's teenage mothers
There's dying brothers, shooting out with one another
They wanted badly, for sisters to call them Daddy
To drive a Caddy, stories unheard by Dear Abby
They're dressing flashy
Can't be caught in fatigue khakis
They're rocking cool G(?), versace and cold boots G
These brothers do it for the love of the life
But I refuse to fall twice and take Miss Ghetto to wife
I used to sex her, bust my nut, get my cash real fast
But that was all that she produced, I felt my life wouldn't last
We used to go to New York, traffic guns of all sort
When killing became sport street life became short
I thought, ""Are we junkies like these baseheads, Yo
They addicted to the crack while we addicted to dough""
For truly, I never meant to fall in love with this shit
But Miss Ghetto you's a slut so I'm divorcing you bitch
Bust it

Chorus

See, there go some niggas that I used to roll with
Still on that crack and gun shit
Endless pursuit to rush shit, bust it
Miss Ghetto got 'em strung out on the putang cream
That does up Wu-Tang fiends 
For slingin cocaine, dig it
We used to do the bumper crack for the sex
While making love to the checks, Miss Ghetto's steelo complex
Living trifling, no matter where my life went
Miss Ghetto, my new wife, went she made it more exciting
Fighting, shooting out, doing all types dirt
Being these, seeing G's putting in much work
Word, we used to keep a sisters underwear laced
With ganja and freebase and bo juice to parlay
Flip! Me and my niggas ran the strip pushing dips
Black cats and plastics, fucking the minds of black kids
Till one day, I was confronted by this wise old chap
He said, ""I know you sell crack, but what, you out to kill blacks?""
I wasn't trying to hear it, my excuse sorta weak
I said that we gotta eat, that's why we running these streets
Then he said, ""Don't you know that whitey give you that coke,
that bullshit pursuit of plush that got you killing your folk?""
Life, I didn't understand that shit back then
But now I do so I refuse to roll with whitey again
Bust it
I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing, niggas.

I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing, niggas.

Chorus x2

See Gods, you like cocaine, fucking with my brain
You like cocaine, running around my brain
For the love of this...",Miss Ghetto

I strike a pose, strike my mic with these flows
Am I nice?  I suppose
Heaven knows I'm on some other shit
Sisters and shows call me boombastic

Stamp on it girl, I'm telling you
For truly strong like that's the God that's in me
She was my agony, and no idea, see
I educate you through the teacher in me
There ain't no reefer in me
One swig of malt licquor end a nigga
I touch the mic and universally greet
Rising earths with peace
And you know how I'm like that
Do this for blacks stranded in projects
Cashing welfare checks, we gots to do what we gots to

Shots ring, I trip, grip this plastic
I gots to stay refined, body and mind

One hundred thirty seven one third miles per hour
I put your planet in continuous revolution
Penetrate, dry mist from a lake
Create rain, snow, sleet, hail and earthquakes
Snowflakes under the surface of the spot that you stand
See God is a man, and you can't deny that
I set it off, let it off it pops
Fuck track backdrops for fat raps I rock
Knoledge, me going deaf kiss the sky like Meth
Rise above earthly matters watch the truth undress
I saw the moon turn to blood, watch the sun go black
Sisters crying come back, cause now the whole world lacks science
Recognize the infinite size
Poor Righteous Teachers, word is life

Word is bond, (word) word is life
And word is life, (word) my word is life 
(x3)


(Word is my life G)

Back in the day before the words became flesh
Poor Righteous Teachers ran shit in a triple stage of blackness
I spat the spit fact this chick gave birth
To black gods on earth, cause I be cream of the planet G
You notice me, freaking shit like Jodeci
Who the fuck you supposed to be? Siegfried and Wise
Love outburst mercy if my word ever fail
I accepted death I saw through my words being false
Splendid way of life, knowledge and wisdom complete
Understanding, over-standing on this Superman beat
Poor Righteous Teachers sat back
Saw what it was that y'all lack
Culture designed the attack
We got one Clark for the track
Set it off it's bond, true
Word is bond
I got my cellular phone cause the wisdom's calling
Keep 'em refined, body and mind
They'll forever love Wise, word is life

Word is bond, (word) word is life
And word is life, (word) my word is life

I'm not sure, no more, constant war
What's it all for? Everybody out here poor
Niggas cuttin throat, got crack heads sellin soap
Little shorties down the block, pushin dope and coke
Try and make it out the ghetto, where you gon run to
Oh I see he got you, exactly where he wants you
In the projects, doin fucked up things
Like sellin crack, it's like my whole family fiends
If it ain't one thing, it's bound to be another
Peace to all three time felons, word to mother
Niggas gettin hit with outrageous bids
While the next man in the world raisin ya kid
Now what you gon do, it's all up to you
Be your own man, or run behind your crew
If you get bag, don't expect no help
In the street life, everybody roll for delf

Black on black crime, you know it gotta stop
It's time that my peeps, we start reachin for the top
The only way we gonna get there, is together
Let's start the revolution, you know I'm for whatever

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
If I had one wish, every black man would be rich
Own they own property, have they tailor made shit
In peacefully, in luxury, comfortably
Every memory, would be a butter milk fantasy
We enjoy the great outdoor, fuck war
Everyday live, would be like a paid rapper on tour
Without the problems, we don't really need them
Every wiz would be a dime, every nigga be handsome
The only drug would be jarweed, with a little bonbon jee
That's all a black man need
Money would be somethin that we burn in the fire
While livin in Alaska, with ya midnight desire
Sippin on Dacarri, happily, enjoyin the scenery
Snow fall, natural like a girl's virginity
Every time be like the first time
Somethin like the last time
Remindin you of your past time
When things bob you wasn't that great
Robbin niggas for waste, up ya childhood upstate
Couldn't escape, the gun slingin, flower bringin
Under the buildin, callin yourself kingpinnin'

Stiff jabs or stiff kicks, for a nigga

You hold every sentimental
As for me, I lost my feelings somewhere inside the temple
Where they got throat cutters and back stabbers
A life is lost right in front of your eyes, nothing really matters

You just go on living, Projects is like prison
We got fags and dikes, razor blades and knives
Homo thugs, and all type of drugs
Addicts, snitches, bitches, holdin ya pictures

With nothin on but a thong
Fuck me, leave at night, for a trailer visit, fuck you in the morn
Bad boys, we killin toys, they muffle and noise
Never lose they boys, they just keep on squeezin

Bodies drop for no reason, kill you for breathin
Rumble till we even, or till one of us die
Eye for an eye, yo it's no more Mr. Nice Guy
Heads gotta fly, we 'em up, let 'em hang dry

Choke 'em till they pass out, wake up in ya briefs
Playin for keeps, yo fuck you and your peeps
Never had it good, my last album went wood
Bought my words when you hear this, I'm movin out the hood

Takin no prisoners, no eye witnesses, if ya sensitive
Back up, you want no part of this
Ghetto bastard, who never got his ass kicked
I just stay kickin ass, got the mic and the smash

Step up, feel the blast from the Brown Bomber
You don't really want drama, quick to start shit
But then go runnin to ya mama ""Dial 911
Brown Hornet on the new cent, he fuckin with my son""

Bitch tell that piece of shit to finish what he started

Weak rapper, told ya lame ass not to cry

What's goin on world?
It's Pop Da Brown Hornet
Chillin wit Black, Blackstreet, Chauncey
This song is dedicated to, inspired by
Brother of mine, Poo Johnson
My love baby, this for you

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
A childhood friend of mine, was shot to death
I visioned his body, fo' they lay him to rest
The autopsy showed he was hit in the head, in the chest
Weakened the strip, straight through his flesh
Whoever responsible will see the judge
I hold no grudge, I fight evil with love
I hear no evil, and I see non either
Comin from believin the creator
As a juvenile, I would often sit and wonder
Starin out the window at the lightning and thunder
Will they better days for mom dukes and me, at birth
She wrapped up her dreams and gave them to me
Genetically, I could feel the energy
Pullin me towards my destiny, it was meant to be
Eventually, it'll all pay off
If you want it bad enough, you gotta give what it costs

[Chorus]
Every woman, every man
To spread the news across the land
Stand up, stand up, stand up
Everybody, there has to be a better plan
Stand up, stand up, stand up

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
Nothin in life for free, not even death
Can know and at em, cut out to be the best
With we form mistakes, no one was born perfect
Be careful who you love, because they might no deserve
The knowledge that I drop, pure enough to worship
As for Pop the individual, I'm just a mere mortal
I'm trying to make it out of poverty
Buy some property, build for the family
Establish and establishment
Put the proceeds I receive from entertainment
All I want is love-love, so I can retire the all black knockout glove
And just touch you in the mental, reach the next level
Weed out the devil, assemble the puzzle
Blow up a 8X10 so you can see the big picture
Take care of self, we can all get richer

[Chorus]

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
Yo, any day could be our last, a world full of psychopaths
Learn ya math, or you just might crash
How to reality and into insanity
In this cold world we can't even trust family
Nowhere to turn when you stuck in between a
Concrete jungle and a pack of hyenas
Scavenger huntin, ain't no time for frontin
Brothers in the street with nothin
Always tryin to take somethin from somebody
They usually pray on the week, 
sacrifice a life 'cause somehow they gotta eat
No regrets when actin out threats
It's a different world when growin up inside the Projects
Outsiders get hawked by night riders
You bound to get game in a world full of liars
You gotta stand firm on shaky grounds
Yo Chauncey, break it down for Da Brown

It's only Pop and I'm hangin MC's like a stockin
Leavin them no option, throwin the towel
Or gettin they face boxed in
No time for B.S.'in, second guessin, all that's outta the question
I'm here to terrorize, make rappers apologize
I refuse to lose, I'm beat, battered and bruised
Now that I'm on, fuck payin dudes
Fuck all of youse, I'm bad news to goody two shoes
Who be finger snappin and toe tappin
I'm that kid that keep it crackin, 'cause I'm what's happenin
I love this game with a passion, stop askin
How do you like me now, that I'm the last one laughin
Hole fucked up, puffin on Alaskan
Hundred miles an hour, eyes closed, without crashin
Constantly, I gotta flip they wig
For I'm the kid, that got the state pumpin in they trips

No sloppy copies, it's ya black Poppy
Rollin in between the sheets, been missin for weeks

Cats be coolin down, I neva had, I neva will

Ladies and gentlemen, feel the adrenaline rush
Two triple oh, from poor to plush
Started workin out, I went from gut to cuts
Now when they see me it be ""ooh"" and ""ahh""
Before they used to call me a want to be rap star
Now they tellin stories on how we used to hang
And how they encouraged me to keep doing my thing
Funny how non believers, want to take the credit
They so pathetic, but me don't sweat it
I stay focus, they hocus pocus
Disappear in the struggle, reappear when ya bubble
Where was you in my time of need
Now you smell success, you stick around like creed
To smoke up all the weed, ya drink up all the Guinness
Don't want to leave until everything finish
Same muthafucka who curse ya name
Be the same muthafucka who soft you for ya gleam
Then tell me, ""Don't complain, it's part of the game""

What you want? House squad, I'm here to clean out the pipe
Here to make it right, make sure the rhymes keep flowin
Minds stay blowin, my jobs are constantly showin
How to do that deal like the All I Seeyin
Rappers get scared, they start Caller I.D.'ing
Afraid to get the message there career's been terminated
And Pop Da Brown has officially graduated 
into the ranks of top contention
And while I'm here I have to give mention 
to my mom, my dad, they knew the time
Other leaders get the dick, your world was mine
Stripped of ya shine, know you just as bright as a bird
Haven't you heard, heard, heard

Pop Evil,"I'm miles away from the truth
Does the sacrifice matter
Be well prepared for the faithful
I lost my way somewhere
Between the light of your disapproval
Fuel the fire my soul is burning

Facing the sun living with shadows
Holding redemption so close in the palm of our hands
So many questions always unanswered
Still we bleed for the answers
Ash to dust bleed we must
Will it all be undone when the kingdom comes

Broken glass this working class
Built to simply be shattered
This isolation still concerning
Just letting go of the unknown
Sometimes leads me to madness
Instead we choose to spend our days in blackness
So tell me

Facing the sun living with shadows
Holding redemption so close in the palm of our hands
So many questions always unanswered
Still we bleed for the answers
Ash to dust bleed we must
Will it all be undone when the kingdom comes

How many more times can we make mistakes?
So many lies inside
I bury my face in the ground just to watch them burn
Return always to the front lines
Divide tore up but in due time
Never more will we settle the score
What absolution has to answer for

The passing time we all betray

Stop running away, put it all on display
Love when your anger increases
You were born this way, everything has to fade
But your anger increases

No alibis or goodbyes
I've seen those eyes hypnotized
Always no doubt but to get more
Hardcore all day to the core
Once more I've been to the thin line
This time all in with an incline
One blood set in stone
Disown all alone try to dethrone

The passing time we all betray

Stop running away, put it all on display
Love when your anger increases
You were born this way, everything has to fade
But your anger increases

Stop running away, put it all on display

At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet

While we sleep, sleep, sleep

Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

I can see a blur but I just can't feel my way, Sometimes I feel I'm just not real, My head's in disarray, I've no ambition and no direction Can't face today, today; My mind's distracted by the light refracted... I drift offworld to avoid detection, Disengaged, A.W.O.L., inactive, I'm the boy without a soul, No hot love, no worldly goal, Inject me, inject me... Got to fix this empty head 'cause life's a bitch and then you're dead, Inject me, inject me... Obscene white light, too bright, too frightening, My friend, my bed's inviting, Time's elastic and passions are plastic In the land of quicksand: the psyche fantastic I'm on top of the world, can you see that far? Ha! Ha! Look at me Ma! I can fly as high as the sky, I am sci-fi! You care to say, ""Hi!""...I say bye-bye My positronic ray will blast the day away So be warned! I'm surfin' the dead zone, And keep you all at bay. In the twilight, unknown, Singin' my own imaginary songs to hum alng to. A sex goddess, all mine, to belong to... You can play it for her, you can play it for me, I'm the boy without a soul, A dream melody to resurrect me... Inject me, inject me... No hot love, no worldly goal, Cut the lights, and shut the doors, Use, abuse, take me I'm yours, Inject me, inject me... --------------------------------------------------------

Of all lies and disguise

In Bacchus we trust

Divine giver of ecstacy

Rise above

So no first night nerves 
All first serves! All aces! 
Straight home bases 
Sweating like a pig doing the jig 
At the gig of the century 
Because we'll never be 
Told by the old school 
Sold the old rules 
Tho' we're no fools 
Downbeats down to earth

Clowning round the town 
Step easy 
Cooking up new tricks 
Looking for a new kick 
Found a new sound 
Found that it sticks 

Heard about the bird 
'Bout the plane and 
The superman? 
Word is: We can outlast anyone 
Supercede the superfly guys 
Who will concede 
They are dying flies

Could be dangerous

At worst a thirst 
Bursting for the next rhyme

The proof of youth 
So move over rover 
Hey! Disco King 
You've stopped dancing 

Best admit 
This hit's an obsession 
Lost in lust 
Better listen to the lessons 
Bright lights big city 
Broad minds 
Bored pretty easily 
Busted just for justice sake 
They can't control a soul 
Ther's an outbreak 
Of outrageous love 
It's contageous and 
It's here to save us 
Some say: 
""Now way DJ don't play 
The laterst the greatest 
The mad and bad way.""

Call it a wall of noise

Drain myself away like Hancock in Sydney

I could try to change it but it suits me too well
A not so private hell

You feed my hunger but drown all my senses
In the satisfaction stakes, it's like sitting on the number nine bus
I can't stop me, you can't stop me, I can't stop me, you can't stop me
One's too many, ten's not enough

Over and out-underground

Down here, talk to us, we'll here, the future is here

Popchop,"Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips

So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

But right now I got my mind set up 
Lookin' down tha barrell of my 9 
Get up 
Cause it's time to make tha pay back phat 
To my brothers on tha block--better stay strapped black 
And accept no substitutes 
I bring truth to tha youth tear tha roof off tha ol' school

Oh no, I won't turn tha other cheek 
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week 
Now we gotta make it smash 
Blast 
How long will it last, till tha broke get more cash 
Until then 
Raise up! 
Tell my young black males 
Blaze up! 
Life's a mess don't stress

Much love to my brothers in tha pen 
See ya when I free ya

Once again, is there no one else strapped 
Keep ya hands on ya gat

I'm supposed to say 'peace', sing songs, and get capped on

But it's time for tha new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man clan
Here we go 
Turn it up
Don't stop
To my homies on tha block
Gettin' dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound
Underground for ya
And I'ma throw a changup
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in tha backstreets
Tha blackstreets
They fear me when they rollin in they phat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song
A black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in tha struggle
Hustlin' to tha other brotha's bubble
 
Hollar if ya hear me

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claimin' that I'm violent
But still I kick

Never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could
It's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring tha noise
To all my boyz
Know tha real from tha bustas
And the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real 'G'
Pump ya fists if ya feel me
Hollar if ya hear me
Learn to survive in tha nine-tre
I make crime pay

Whatever it takes to make a stand
Cause nobody else'l give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin' for tha day to let tha rage free
Still me, till they kill me

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it

You better hit bull's eye

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!

Guess who's back with a brand new rap 
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case

No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys 
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything, 
But little boys 
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor, 
I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good God, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor

Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah

So So Def
Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Whoop ass, let security carry em out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
Feels like a midget is hanging from my neckless
I pulled up wit a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?! The club and moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get em outta them pants
Take note to the brand new dance, like this

Go on wit ya big ass! lemme see something
Tell ya little friend he can quit mean mugging

That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress
But Louie Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest
C'mon! we going party tonight

Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 Nigga (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, Andre?

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was ""The Chronic"" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping two one three (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Oh, I got the boogie-woogie right down in my very soul.
There ain't no need for me to be a wallflower,

I knew all the time but now I'm gonna let you know:
I'm gonna keep on rocking, no matter if it's fast or slow.
Ain't gonna stop until the twenty-fifth hour,

Popinjays,"Once I believed that when love came to me
It would come with rockets, bells and poetry
But with me and you it just started quietly and grew
And believe it or not
Now there's something groovy and good
Bout whatever we got
And it's getting better
Growing stronger warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
I don't feel all turned on and starry eyed
I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside
Holding you at night just seems kind of natural and right
And it's not hard to see
That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be
Cause it's getting better
Growing stronger, warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
And just like a flower that takes time to bloom
This love of ours is taking time to grow
Ba da da da da da da da da da da da
And I don't mind waitin', don't mind waitin'
Cause no matter how long it takes
The two of us know
That it's getting better

Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's dj vu
I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west LA
Or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me

I'll be there for you

On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""how you been""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you",Aray (Hurt)
Pops Fernandez,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
Without saying a word you can light up the dark.
Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing.
 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.
 
All day long I can hear people talking out loud, 
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd.
Old Mister Webster could never define 
what's being said between your heart and mine.
 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.

Stand truly thankful for the sites I see,

For rippin' through tracks like epidemic disease,

Poptastik Karaoke,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road [In the Style of Bruce Springsteen] [Karaoke Tribute]

Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
I'm on fire

It's like someone took a knife
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull

And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire

Poptastik Karaoke,"I come from down in the valley
Where mister when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride, yeah yeah

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well Mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care

But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse
That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight, yeah
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh down to the river we ride, oh

Poptastik Karaoke,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man

He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around 
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown

In '65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights between the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed in a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come 
To my hometown
My hometown
My hometown

Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back 
To your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown

Last night me and Kate we laid in bed

Packing up our bags maybe heading south

I was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right

And I still beat my head against the wall
I still rage and wage my little war

Close it up and throw away the key

I survived against the will of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
And said

Follow me down to the valley below

Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul

My David don't you worry
This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you

Well maybe she remembers us collecting space up in the sky

Gave her the truth
Gave her the proof

Illustrates a phantasmagoria of fear, terror, grief, exultation and finally breakdown. 
The highlights have been compressed on this recording to make their own disquieting points.

The time is 9:30 P.M. 
One hour after the participants have eaten sugar cubes saturated with LSD. 
We hear Brian and his fellow travelers observing their gradual transformation.

Brian has been amusing his friends by chewing on some plastic flashbulbs.

The time is now 1:00 A.M. 
Brian is unable to snap his fingers, and terminate the trip which continues.

He sobs, as his joy turns to fear.

Brian's rocky journey ended twelve hours after it so innocently has begin. 
He was shattered by it.

This young man never had a bummer, 
In some thirty-three LSD trips. 
Everyone of them was a delight, 
He only needed to snap his fingers and down he came, anytime. 
But on Voyage 34 he finally met himself coming down an up staircase and the encounter was crushing.",Voyage 34

Porno for Pyros,"I met a girl
Who'd never had
An orgasm
I couldn't believe
She'd never had one
I said, ""sit back
And get yourself relaxed""

You looked so good
So good
So good
So good
You looked so good to me
So good to me

She thought that I
Was just the one
She said, ""I know
That you could do it""
She had to know
Got curious
What it was like
Enough to trust me

You looked so good
So good
So good
So good
You looked so good to me
So good to me

You looked so good
So good
Oh so good
So good
You looked so good to me
So good to me

There was fire and smoke on the T.V.
Cops and the army
People running out in the street looting

And came four times

Porno for Pyros,"I got the devil in me
It's a cloud
It's sadness
It's a cloud
Then I find compassion
And I find
It vanishes
These thoughts I have they seem
To pass me by
Like a cloud

I was praying
It's a cloud
And hope it's just another form of prayer
It's a cloud

I want to find some laughter
When you laugh they can't kill you
These thoughts i have they seem
To pass me by
Like a cloud

Porno for Pyros,"You didn't have to give your necklace to me before I left
Now I lay awake and think how very smart you were
I thought about you every day
I hear the rain comin' in from miles away
The air is as clean as your skin next to my face
Thought about you every day
100 ways
I thought about you and me a hundred ways
100 ways
And now I lay awake and dream you're right above my face
Look into my eyes the way you doìdon't look away
Thought about you every day
Birds fall in love here right above my head
They make the same kind of sounds you do
When we're laying in my bed
100 ways
I thought about you and me a hundred ways
100 ways
And if I had my way when I woke up
in the morning I would read and write
before I ever drew the shades I would kiss you
before you opened up your eyes
Birds build their homes here right above my head
They make the same kind of sounds you do
When we're laying in my bed
100 ways
I thought about you and me a hundred ways
100 ways

Porno for Pyros,"dogs they roam
remember where their home is
everyone they meet
chase away their enemies
hang out in the shade
always in the shade
when it's time to mate they're
not too particular
dogs they rule the night!
they rule the night
dogs they rule the night!
finish every meal
settle for a snack
chasing cars
like to hang out in the park
dogs they rule the night!

in the pack they're very brave
they're very brave
and then after dark...
underneath the moon!

ever watch 'em go?

Porno for Pyros,"Ain't been twelve a couple of hours
I'm on the freeway

The wettest coldest grey
Then she takes a look at me
I tell her it's O.K.
Driving around with her
She's taking trips on me
I'm taking trips on her

Left the sunset back in Cenice
I was on the freeway
Say you love me or I'll kill us!
But you won't say it
Reach across the seat
And push the bucket back all the way
Driving around with her
She's taking trips on me
I'm taking trips on her
I fell in love with her
I just don't mention it
To fall in love this much
It's very dangerous
She makes me so jealous
I want to kill us both...
