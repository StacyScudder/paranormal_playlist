Entre Ríos,"Puedo detenerme justo para
Detenerte y no hay calma
Sin decirte una palabra
Mas que antes de ayer
Era siempre después
¿Y que pasa
Si te digo hasta mañana?

Yo me siento que
Junto a tu lado
Yo me siento que
Junto a tu lado
Yo me siento que
Un poco más cerca

Entre Ríos,"Aturdido de noche y días, confundido
No hice nada de nada
Gracias por la distancia, que no alcanza
En este drama me haces falta

He caído para hacer ruido ambiental
Me caí por el sonido que hare mal

Cuida de las palabras, que me atrapan
Que te nombran, que me callan
Cubrime de esos versos, que no riman
y acarician las caídas

Salva para esta noche, otro día
Cuidame de otra tarde de drama

He caído para hacer ruido ambiental
Me caí por el sonido que hare mal",Drama
Entre Ríos,"Veo trepar esta inocencia
Con la misma inconciencia

Un espiral hacia ti",Inocencias
Entre Ríos,"Esta tarde hasta al caer
Tan fuerte como quien
Piensa es tan tarde

La noche suave para oír
Y a tiempo estoy aquí
Diciendo que te quiero

Ya sé, que vivo en la luna
O cerca del sol
Ya sé, que vivo en la luna
O cerca del sol

Mañana habrá luz de mañana
Tu misma voz temprana que ilumina

Hay tanto tanto cada paso
El día irá entregándote a mis brazos

Ya sé que vivo en la luna
O cerca del sol
Ya sé, que vivo en la luna
O cerca del sol
Ya sé, que vivo en la luna

Entre Ríos,"Quise odisea más que océano
Que cambie como el mar
Quizá distinto sea verte aquí
Como sirena

Antes de inventar te creo
Mas que imaginar te siento

Aquí, lejos de mi, esperando
Así, me seguiré acercando

Existe un mundo bajo el suelo
Ahí soy un hipocampo
Verdad de agua o tal vez sed de amor
Azul marino

Antes de inventar te creo
Mas que imaginar te siento

Así, todo esto que me pierde
Es más mío de lo que tengo",Odisea
Entre Ríos,"Donde vivís te sobra
Yo nunca pido más
Lo que queda
Es siempre menos

Voy hacia el campo, y ahí hay
Un grito familiar
Y todos dan
Mas de lo que tienen

Decime si hay
Algún lugar que tenga
Mediodías para dar

Ahora hay hambre otra vez
Ves, ahora hay hambre a tus pies",Sobra
Entre Ríos,"Tantas veces te ví
Dispuesto a recordar
Tantas flores de abril
Dispuesto a deshojar

Mi memoria dice

Más para los demás

Tantas veces te ví
Tantas veces te ví",Tantas Veces
Entre Ríos,"Ya no me sorprendés
Tiento al destino amable
Justo a tiempo para saber
No voy a equivocarme tanto

Como me gusta ver
Como me gusta verte en las mañanas
Cuando salís
Puesta de sol a sol, implica

Algo de mi, no queda nada
Algo de mi, no te hare falta
O ya no te da calma
Ánimo que eres mía ahora

Habla que sola sos
Toda la inspiración que mueve
Todo lo que es de dios
Menos la religión inmóvil

Eres la creación
El fruto mas intenso tuyo
Frágil como el amor
Frágil como las cosas rotas

Algo de mi, no queda nada
Algo de mi, no te hare falta
O ya no te da calma
Ánimo que eres mía ahora",Ya No Me Sorprendés
Entwine,"I see a million stars ahead
I smell the heaven scent
This sadness stains all red
The nightfall's filled with ecstasy
The dusk descends on me
Soon we will be free
We must find the haven for our souls
''cause we know that we have lost our will to live
Snow white suicide
The end is on its way
Snow white suicide
No longer burns the flame
We are kissed by the flaming frost
It seems that all is lost
Time is running out
The darkest light enwreathes the night
I'll leave it all behind
This is our last good-bye

Entwine,"There's no time for you baby. 
No time to realize. 
Our life will be wasted. 
You ruin it with all your lies.
 
Would you die for me baby. 
'Cause I'm dying all the time. 
I'm tired of this faking. 
This time I'm gonna be strong. 
This time I've gotta move on.

Entwine,"I sleep to dream away
Stuck inside a dream
I feel a breeze blowing through my mind
I hear her calling me
She lays all in ruins
And suffocates everything I love

I pray someday the sun will shine on me
I dance throughout the night in pale moonlight

I'm sliding into her sin
The pain is cast aside
I think it's time to leave it all behind
I'm in a ring of fire
All I had is gone
Forever lost
Oh please set me free

I pray someday the sun will shine on me
I dance throughout the night in pale moonlight

I'm losing faith in who I am, so:

I pray someday the sun will shine on me
I dance throughout the night in pale moonlight",The Pit
Entwine,"I'll lead you down to the ocean
I'll show you all my darkest deeds

I feel like losing my emotions
When we fall into the stream

We will drown, we will drown
Into this love
You may decide

I'm hanging on to these emotions
There ain't no cure for love
I think I'm losing my devotions
So I pour my tears into your heart

We will drown, we will drown
Into this love
We may decide

We will drown in this love

Entwine,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",2/4/943
Entwine,"You dragged me down into the unknown
Within desire of love you made me sell my soul

Now that youÂ´re gone
I fall down with my beliefs

Caress my heart and make me whole

Entwine,"Beneath the Surface of my skin
In this loneliness that I'm lost within
(With you)
I close my eyes
Wish you could be true
Wish I could fill you with these words
""I dream of you""

I'd do anything to hold your grace
I'd never face another day without your love

The highest highs and the lowest lows
I'll face the life in it's cruel way

Inside of me
Where I hide to be alone

The things I have never done
It's such a shame
Well, it's your weakness that you hide
So, don't tell me how to live my life
'Cause you're so lame

You may steal my wings tonight
But I'll pay you back for your surprise

You may need my rage to fight
And I'll tear you down with my device

Entwine,"You rape me with your lies
You hurt me deep inside
Some might say I'm not the fortunate one
You love too break me down

Some might say that I'm the fallen one

Lead me out from the dark
And kill my pain

Bring it on
Tear me down
May the world go round and round
At the end of desire
Your world falls down and dies
Bring it on

How could you let me down
And blame me for what you've done
After all I think you're the fallen one

Fleeting touch in the dark
Cause my pain

Bring it on
Tear me down
May the world go round and round
At the end of desire
Your world falls down and dies
Bring it on
Bring it on
I gotta sell my Soul

You reap me with your lies
It hurt's me deep inside
Some might say I'm not the fortunate one
You love too bring me down
But I'll stay too hear you out
Some might say that I'm the fallen one

Free me now
Crawling on my soul

Bring it on
Tear me down
May the world go round and round
At the end of desire
Your world falls down and dies
Bring it on

May the world go round and round (and round)

The world go round and round (and round)

Entwine,"You are going under
Deep inside you hear the silent scream
You are filled with anger
Bitter sides want to be part of you

Scream when you fall
Scream and let it go

All lies entwined around your soul
In your chameleon halo
It's all in your head but it's not your role

You are hate’s creation

Entwine,"Here we are
In this fatal design
But we'll be as one
Under the sun
And we're facing out for hope

Flaming bombs go down again
Burning all the life
Tainting songs of yesterday
Feeding your desire

The day will come for you as well
We know......And I wish you well
For those of you who seek the truth
I know......And I wish you well

Lay down your guns
Lay down your sons
Then we'll be as one
Under the sun
What's the price of life?

Lay down your hands...
Mothers are weeping
Lay down your hands...
Fathers are weeping
Lay down your hands...
Families are weeping
So lay down your hands

Entwine,"I'm on my way
I'm on my way to lose it all
I'm a stranger to myself,I can't go on
I'm all outta space
And I'm surrounded by the wall
I believe that my mind has caught a million storms

Falling down
When you lose all that you are

I surrender...
I kneal down

I'm outta faith
I think I'm a frail design of life
Deep inside in denial
The shades have grown in silence
I hide my face
I close my eye's
Deep inside in my mind
The pain has grown around me

Falling down
When you lose all that you are

I surrender...
I kneal down
I'm dying to find a reason to hold on

It sounds an echo in my soul.
How can I keep from singing?

I hear the truth, it liveth.
And though the darkness 'round me close,
Songs in the night it giveth.

No storm can shake my inmost calm,

And hear their death knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near

When friends by shame are undefiled

When we would read by candlelight,
And on the windowpane outside
A new world made of snow

A million feathers falling down,
A million stars that touch the ground,
So many secrets to be found
Amid the falling snow.

Maybe I am falling down.
Tell me should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make a sound
In the darkness all around.

The silence of a winter's night
Brings memories I hold inside,
Remembering a blue moonlight
Upon the fallen snow.

Maybe I am falling down.
Tell me should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make a sound
In the darkness all around.

I close my window to the night.
I leave the sky her tears of white.
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow.

And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow.",Amid the Falling Snow
Enya,"Where are you this moment?
Only in my dreams.
You're missing, but you're always
A heartbeat from me.
I'm lost now without you,
I don't know where you are.
I keep watching, I keep hoping,
But time keeps us apart.

Is there a way I can find you,
Is there a sign I should know,
Is there a road I could follow
To bring you back home?

Winter lies before me
Now you're so far away.
In the darkness of my dreaming
The light of you will stay.

If I could be close beside you
If I could be where you are
If I could reach out and touch you
And bring you back home

Is there a sign I should know
Is there a road I can follow
To bring you back home to me?",If I Could Be Where You Are

I close my eyes and listen
I can hear the lonesome sound
Of the sky as it cries

Listen to the rain
Here it comes again
Hear it in the rain

Feel the touch of tears that fall
They won't fall forever
In the way the day will flow
All things come, all things go

Listen to the rain, the rain
Here it comes again, again
Hear it in the rain, the rain

Late at night I drift away
I can hear you calling
And my name is in the rain
Leaves on trees whispering
Deep blue seas, mysteries

Even when this moment ends
Can't let go this feeling
Everything will come again
In the sound falling down
Of the sky as it cries
Hear my name in the rain",It's in the Rain

That break my heart in two,

All I've said, all I say to you.

How strong, how brave, how true of you
To bear the hurt I gave.
I know it tears your heart in two,
All I've said, all I say to you.

After all the words are said,
After all the dreams we made,
Every one a precious one,
Every one a summer sun

Can never be again,
So know how much it means to me;
All you said,
All you gave,
All your love to me.",A Moment Lost

Enzo Enzo,"Debout devant ses illusions
Une femme que plus rien ne dérange
Détenue de son abandon
Son ennui lui donne le change

Que retient elle de sa vie
Qu'elle pourrait revoir en peinture
Dans un joli cadre verni
En évidence sur un mur

Un mariage en Technicolor
Un couple dans les tons pastels
Assez d'argent sans trop d'efforts
Pour deux trois folies mensuelles

Elle a rêvé comme tout le monde
Qu'elle tutoierait quelques vedettes
Mais ses rêves en elle se fondent
Maint’nant son espoir serait d'être

Où ma vie se penche sur le vide
Coupés tous les bruits du moteur
Au-dessus de terres arides

Comme un soleil qui veut du mal
Aucune réponse n'apaise
Mes questions à la verticale

J'dis bonjour à la boulangère
Je tiens la porte à la vieille dame
Des fleurs pour la fête des mères
Et ce week-end à Amsterdam

Pour que tu m'aimes encore un peu
Quand je n'attends que du mépris
A l'heure où s'enfuit le Bon Dieu

S'arrêtent parfois de poursuivre
L'ambition de marcher sur Rome

D'être au-delà des apparences

Here's the part that made me laugh.
They didn't give me anything
And then they took half of that.
So sharpen your teeth or lay flat!
You said you'd play clean, oh what a load of crap,
By the time that you were through with me
I had to take a bath
So sharpen your teeth or lay flat!
They said that it'd go good for me,
Rain diamonds and all that.
I stood out in the downpour
Getting hit by broken glass.
So sharpen your teeth or lay flat.

Nos pertes de vue et d’haleine

On est passés entre les mailles
Ou bien on n’s’est pas aperçu

Enzo Jannacci,"Desolato, ma più che desolato incazzato, quando vedo che la gente si uccida
E, lo dicevo 50 anni fa, e lo ripeto ora, ancora, che forse è la volta buona
Che c’è uno tra voi che tra uno sputo e una spinta troverà un’altra penicillina
Altre forme d’amore, forse un po’ più di grinta,
Perché ?, I cantanti, cioè noi

Ma che problemi hai?
C'ho il problema che il tempo non mi basta mai
Ma che problemi hai?
Ho un fratello in galera e non gli basta mai
Ma che problemi hai?
C’ho il problema che il tempo non mi basta mai,
Non mi passa mai, non mi basta mai, non mi passa mai, non mi basta

Chi vuole fare a botte ti chiede
C’hai problemi?
Problemi secolari popolari nei quartieri
In ogni scala e su scala nazionale,
Ma per gli inglesi, italiani o albanesi è uguale
Problemi di pensioni rimosse,
Di debiti e storie, finite le scorte
Crollate le borse, aperte le porte,
La fame che arriva da chi non la conosce
Problema della sigaretta,
È monopolio di stato e stato di dipendenza
Dal petrolio d’Arabia, la badante polacca,
Dal metano di Mosca e dalla pasta di mamma
La religione è un problema se nega la scienza,
E l’ateo se non ha coscienza
Che se la droga in giro aumenta,
È perché ormai costa meno di un pieno di bonza

Desolato, se non trovo la risposta ai tuoi problemi
Desolato, se il mio canto ha degli alibi sinceri
Desolato, se poi il sole non ti ascolta più di tanto
Desolato, se la vita a me, a me piace ancora tanto
Problemi a capire che non c’è un ideale, problemi totali.
Ma io sono al mare. Eh, ho detto che sono al mare

Problemi del figlio del grande fratello,
Problemi per quelli che c’è solo quello
Problemi di notte, del grande amatore
Problemi di sporco, anzi di unto però del Signore
Ma che problemi c’hai?

Vorrei assumere e creare lavoro,
Ma qui fanno business solo I compro-oro
E le sale da gioco, io invece vendo fuoco,
Ma porto I scarp nel tennis e parlo da solo
Parole al vento all’ottanta percento,
Per capire certe cose ci vuole orecchio
Per vedere chi è il nemico serve uno specchio,
Per governare il mio paese ci vuole un vecchio

Ho visto un re, come Jannacci e Fo, gli ho chiesto
Vengo anch’io? Lui m’ha detto No, tu no
È un criminale ma non puoi punirlo, povero re, e povero anche il cavillo
Non ho problemi con il mondo, solo con voi che comandate, se ve ne andate
Sarà ancora bello come quando parla Gaber, desolato ma la vita a me piace!

Desolato, se non trovo la risposta ai tuoi problemi
Desolato, se il mio canto ha degli alibi sinceri
Desolato, se poi il sole non ti ascolta più di tanto
Desolato, se la vita a me, a me piace ancora tanto
Ma che problemi hai?

C’ho il problema che il tempo non mi basta mai
Ma che problemi hai?
Ho un fratello in galera e non gli basta mai

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Enzo Randisi,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Enzo Stuarti,"You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you, 
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!

Enzo Stuarti,"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally
If you will be my love

We're swept apart too soon.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Walk on, through the rain,
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart,
And you'll never walk alone,
You'll never walk alone.

Enzo Stuarti,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night

Like a sigh that greets the close of day
Feel the waters' welcoming arms
Embrace me in the quiet calm
 
I can't hear what you say anymore
Just the sound of trees on the ocean floor
irresistibly drawn from the shore

[Chorus]
I'm drowning in your eyes
I'm floating out to sea
Helpless on the restless tide
That flows between you and me
 
Moving slowly as if in a dream
The colours change from blue to green
All around me reflections of you
In forests deep I'm passing through
 
In the swell of the storm we're as one
We're dancing in the morning sun
Could it be that we've only just begun

Lying here beside you
Try to reach you but you're so far....

So full of sand

You won't take anymore

From this mortal seed
turning deep inside
there's a wound which cannot bleed
for the pleasures we have been denied
All you want to be only we can decide
Try to get ahead, but standing
Like a statue on the edge
You talk about a new direction
But the words fly out and disappear
High windows shine, the light seems like a sign
But there's a crowd down there laughing
But don't seem to hear
Oh it's the same today, always just the same as before
Can't be the same today, step out don't be afraid
You've got the right, got the right for more

See her with her head in her hands
But nothing at all in her eyes
Always listening for the telephone
But it only rings wrong numbers
Or whenever she's not in her home

Thinking life would pass her by
She opened up her arms
To reach for the skies
Her dreams they never came true
So now she paints herself a sad song
Colours it blue
Late cafe closing on the street
He's turning out to hide in doorways
Or any corner that others sleep
Empty bottle spirits he has known
A vision of a quiet face
Together they look like home
Thinking life has passed him by
He opens up his arms
To reach for the sky
His dreams they never came true
So now he paints himself a sad song
Colours it blue 
Memories fading photograph of years ago...
Thinking life has passed them by
They open up their mouths to scream at the sky
Their dreams they never came true
So now they paint themselves a sad song

Suddenly we've lost the forms
To close our cursed wombs
No one seems to realize that (wolves) are in disguise

But the road was just too long

Instead we camouflage the flaws that lie within
Condone the suffering we witness as we mingle casually
We need to right ourselves, or else we will derail

Aiming too high

Patience is a vital virtue
That you'll never have

Don't force me to believe
We're caught up in the greed
'Cause I just care for me
To break it, we'll need everyone
Think it through: unite is the only way

A raging tragedy ignored will have it's justice, finally
Distress and poverty is everyone's disease
We'll come to realize for all we've done
There is a price to pay
Yet hope is never lost, there always is a way

Trumping the game
Is no easy way
Enterprise and discipline
Will pay off in the end

If we ever could look into fate's mirror
We would never have ended up here
We're distracted by every sin committed
It should always be ever so clear

If we ever look
We would never be here

Who is able to break through the circle of life and doom?

Don't look back
Keep on track to break the curse
Take the chance
Design your universe

We can't undo what we have done
So show us now what we've become
Confront us with our viciousness
And our weakness
We can't evade our destiny
So show responsibility
For we all surely have a sense
Of our consciousness

To take for taking's sake
Will leave a path of loss and strain
And endless breaking of faith can warrant acts of treason
If you can't let go, you will end up empty handed
If you can't control, you'll live your life in vain

Who decides about what's true or false?
Who is able to sift through the treasures from the flukes?

The time has come, we have to see
That total wisdom is in reach
The time has come to color in the lines
We must identify the signs

So many people are full of hate
While love and light are in their reach
So many people will harm themselves
But life can be so beautiful

So many people will idolize
While their own success is in their reach

A conversation can take a sudden turn
And reaching the point of violence
Because your silence left you without a hand to hold

Your past will lead you on to make

Making a final judgment
Based on your bias will never bring you forward
Terror should never guide you
For even the fearful can take a beating in the end

Suspicion gets you nowhere

Epica,"Born to fight, and we're born to flee
Doomed to live on ecstasy
Born to lie, and we're born to cheat
Look in the mirror, who do you see?

Born to flee, and we're born to fight
Without your mask, you're terrified
Don't hide your personality
That's who you are, your identity

If the virtues of tomorrow
Cause the greed of today
We won't have a future
Nor liberty

Born to breathe, and we're born to pursue
That's all we are supposed to do
The semblance of our liberty
Is nothing more than slavery

Born to flee, and we're born to fight
Is it failure that's our delight?
Born to cheat, and we're born to lie
Look at yourself, have you lost your mind?

If the virtues of tomorrow
Cause the greed of today
We won't have a future
And no more liberty

If the virtues of tomorrow
Set the need on the way
We won't have a future nor liberty

Private vice leads to public virtue

Raised to think that we are free
Living in our caves
Being slaves

We lost control of our lives
At the mercy of the waves
Massive waves

Blind to see what's going on
Conditioned as we are
And we are

We lost control of our greed
But now we face it all
Face our fall

Keeping all that we've created
And consuming all that's possible
Reaching deep into temptation
Nothing can stop us

Guarantee our hard-earned profits
Multiplied ten-fold if possible
Reaching out for new redemption
Nothing avails our needs

My opponent won't rule out raising taxes.
But I will, and The Congress will push me to raise taxes and I'll say no.
And they'll push, and I'll say no, 
And they'll push again, and I'll say to them,

EPMD,"Cooling on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
(Yo P you was packing?) You know I'm strapped
Posse kept rolling it was hard to get with em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started spraying niggas

What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
That can head your mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Giving best wishes to the best MC
The E the D-O-U-B-L-E

Because I'm housing

Cooling at a party, no better yet disco
Head feeling mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move

To crush and fry a sucker MC like Crisco
Every chance I get, I try to kill
That's one less sucker new jack, who tried to act ill
I keep the place jumping til the party's through
Whether it's disco, hardcore, or rhythm and blues
Take off your coat, won't you stay a while
Check out the voice that is smooth and mild
It's like Wheel of Fortune, go on for big money
Come cold rock the party, and leave wit ya honey

Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
Treating me the E Doubl-E, like a stepchild
Well let me tell you homeboy you're living foul
MC's, you know who you are
(On the bandwagon) Why P? (Cause you a star)
This is the year that when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite the style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start capping
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
As I proceed to rock, the girls are clocking
Some brothers act hard but the rest are jocking

Because I'm housing

I come on strong, like a bodybuilder
Cast a spell upon a sucker, like witch Matilda
Deliver a rhyme like Federal Express
My intention's not to dis, but impress
For the ladies and gents, the money was spent
To see the E-P-Double-E-M-D (yes the main event)
In concert, not worried bout oos n boos (because we do work)
To make your body jerk
(To make your girl want to leave her man and start to flirt
With the P) Double-E MD Double E'n
I'm not skeezing, but pleasing
All party goers, also behind show-ers
Who like the not, fast slow flow of rhymes that form in my dome
Out the mouth, to the microphone

are 
strapped They mean business no time for play If you bite a line they 
blow 
you away The more you bite your body gets hot Don't get too cold 
because you 
might get shot Knowin' that my rhyme's like a poisonous rat Don't play

Sick em champ... 
Well I have a new dance  that you all must learn 
You may have seen the Pee Wee Herman but it's had it's turn 
Now this brand new dance  I know you not with it 
You might break your neck  to really try to get it 
If you seen the clumsy movie it was called The Jerk 
You had to check out Steve Martin as he started the ""Kirk""
He was doin freaky moves with his feet and head 
With his blue farmer suit and his big Pro-Keds 
Now if you want to learn it, it really takes time 
That's why I'm here now tellin you this rhyme 
And if you never seen it, then I'll be startin 
My brand new funky dance, called the Steve Martin 
Like this...get em Steve, get em 
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em 
Get em... 
Like this... 

[Erick Sermon] 
Well the dance is def, and it's gonna last 
I don't really think any other dance will pass 
All the dancers out there tryin to freak on the floor 
When they see me do the Martin they try to ignore 
When they see my dance, they came to a surprise 
I caught the suckers ducks speakin eye to eye 
While they bitin my stuff, like I wasn't there 
But they didn't have the right so, I didn't care 
Sway your arms around your back, then across your chest 
Do the crazy leg sweep from right to left 
It's the Steve... 

[Parrish Smith] 
Like this... 
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em... 
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em... 
Get em... 
Well it's back to the man on the mic you see 
Because I'm stuck to my dance like a dog on a flea 
Now I know my dance is the funky dance comin 
Pee-Wee Herman (Biz Markie) was pumpin (but mine is jumpin) 
It's the Steve... 
Like this, sick em champ 
(Steve Martin's in full effect!) 
Sick em champ 
(Yo Steve's a weasel! Show em how your Steve Martin go) 
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em [x4]
(Ahh yeah, Steve Martin in full effect) 
EPMD, strikin once again, funky fresh in the flesh 
(True, yo, PMD! Oww, yeah...) 
I be the P double E-M-D in the place 
(Yeah check this out P, I think this is the last record of the album... 
Aww we made it!) 
Yo yo what time is it? 

[Erick Sermon] 
Nineteen eighty-eight is so great, and eighty-nine even better 
And don't forget, to take off that hot sweater... 
Yeah check this out y'all! 
We got this funky track, ahh, yo yo yo 
Check this out homeboys 
Because we dope, the dope-di-dope-di-dope-di-dope 
The dope-di-dope-nope-we-ain't-no-joke 
No-joke-no-joke, so PMD!! Yo!! 
We ain't no joke, no-joke-no-joke-no-joke-the-dope 
(On the Columbo tip!) 
I'm the real deal homeboy, for real 
(On the strength!) 
Because we in there, yes we in there 
And we're outta here, like last year 
(We lost the bandwagon, because I'm housin...) 
We goin straight for the kill because you're loungin

EPMD,"Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric, its hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(don't sleep on the e) you see, something might rupture
I don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge, cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus, EPMD in town

Total chaos, no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizing known to cause an illusion
Like a magician, who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
Its traveling the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening, plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the twilight zone
You're terrified, plus you cant bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, in the land of the lost
You start to shiver, but then you scream, my friend
Yo wake up muttley, because you're dreaming again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm strictly business

This is the rap season, where the e starts pleasing
Girls around the world no need to be skeezing
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case, a brother acts a fool
Ive got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor
(get busy, boy) like you never saw before
Rhyme flow, good to go, after the show, Ill pull your hoe, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow? ), hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffing
And my parents find out, then they start riffing
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the e, the r-I-c-k

MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends, heart rate increases
Its like beam me up, scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as aids when its time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once, then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, how high?
Because I'm taking no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
Cause you're a soldier, and I'm a green beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this
Bring your dog, mom, and dad, because I'm strictly business

Yo yo, you're still picking on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the sandman, sucker, because its over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turning and my so-called friends
They smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff, because they don't have cash
Like the e-double, or the PMD
He drives a corvette, I drive a samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith, with the key to fame
Never high on myself, always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back, fatigued? no, I'm not

Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxing
Or relaxing, just subtracting and reacting
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yapping and flapping
I lose my cool, then Ill start slapping and smacking
You wanna roll? then Albee start jacking and capping
No time to lounge, I'm packing and strapping
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and biting is illegal
So next time I'm in town, I highly recommend this
You gots to chill, because I'm strictly business",Strictly Business

Snappin' necks and cashin' large checks, as I flex then wreck
So E what's next?

Shazam, let me tell you who I am
The E-R-I-C-K, S-E-R-M-O-N
Call me a lumberjack, or a midland warrior
Doin damage to the world worse than the Hurricane Gloria
I'm serious, you can say I'm furious
You're sayin in your mind, ""Who is he?"" because you're curious
A rare rap style, not heard by the usual
You bite you get damaged, so my brothers stay mutual

While I'm makin and takin, emcees shakin and flakin
Pre-heat my oven to three hundred degrees and start bakin
Emcees like potatoes, beats kickin like Cato
Gettin philosophical like the Greek man Plato (who?)
Greek man Plato (who?) The Greek man Plato
But I'm the A.K.Ato flow, bro
As you all well know, I do a show
Pick up the dough and ho, break to the limo
Money in the pocket, Albee's hands on the ammo
Crack the Olde Gold, as we roll and stroll
Don't play bold sucker, cause you was told
Your spot in the box in eighty-eight was sold
So quit the singin come swingin cause of the beat that I'm bringin
Tryin to wax EPMD, you be U.G.-in
On a heavy narcotic, such as speed or crack
Because your rhyme's mediocre but your tracks are wack
Not fiction but fact black, believe that
Then put away your demo cause the brother is back
And get the bozack, E

As I sing and do my thing I might sing
Jane, or the whole shabang
But if I snap, during the course of the rap
P tap me on the back, throw the crowd a flap
Just to distract, til I'm intact
Get my Fisherman hat, so I can mack
Groove to the rhythm of a funky track
Like (""Yo, you smack me and I'll smack you back"")
I come correct with the context
And then next and flex and throw a hex on your whole complex
And then check for a second, yo, then say
(R-E-S-P-E-C-T) Respect!
For me the E Double, or the emcee rap goddess
Cause me and PMD we get ours regardless
So get the bozack, P

Yo, time to get funky and raw
Stompin' mud holes of posses (like who?) like Gigantor
Cause when we roll we come fully equipped
Mic in the hand, tooly, and spare clips
Like a detonator with no ticks I then trip or slip
Or maybe flip while my DJ's on the mix
Never lost a battle and if I did it was fixed
You must be sick of all on the diznick, like a jim hat
Your shit ain't pumpin and your rhymes are wack
'Cause you're a nickel dime sucka, who hangs with Tommy Tucker
Like KRS-One says, you a Part Time Sucka
Who works O.T., to be like me
The Capital P, the M, I'm like D
To slay an emcee, on the S-P-O-T
Leave without a motive or a C-L-U-E
So get the bozack, E

The MC Grand Royal on the microphone
Terrorist, mafioso, a.k. E Capone
I'm no joke on the stroke I broke so don't choke
No hopes folks, I quote note for note
You mind float on the rhyme on I wrote (what?)
And does the Wild Thing, like my boy Tone Loc
It's equipped with the kit that bit the whole shit
Don't catch a nitfit, because my style legit
Brand new from the crew for you no voodoo
A trick from the flicks master Wu Kung-Fu
Equipped with the posse and the time I need
Cock diesel like Rocky and Apollo Creed
So get the bozack, P

Yo, mic checkin, checkin and checkin and checkin
Scanned the crowd, then start wreckin
Either kill or be killed, in the field of hip-hop
Cause if you're slow you blow you get popped mopped and dropped
If you snooze, you lose, here come the oohs and boos
I pop a No-Doz, relax my lips and cruise
Past a pooh putt'n sucka whose all about schemein
Wax the P twice, you must be dreamin
Cause as you moan and groan, from the mouth you foam
Sayin deep down inside, I shoulda left P alone
Cause it's a fact, black, that when I'm loopin the track
To lounge in the Danger Zone, because I'm back
In fact, Jack, before I launch my attack
Premeditate my assassination and come strapped
Playin rough and tough, but when I called your bluff
You tried to post on the microphone doctor and got snuffed
So get the bo-zack
Yo, get the bozack
Yeah, get the bozack

Get the bozack, get the bozack
Get the booooooeoeooooeeohzack
Get the bozack, get the bozack
Get the booooooeoeooooeeohzack

Yo, I don't play",Get the Bozack
EPMD,"As the wind sets the mood, it's time to let off
A sucker tried to play me, the E I'm not soft
I'm very hardcore, droppin bombs like Warsaw
It reminds me, back in 1984
When I went to a party with the master plan
To step up, and put the mic in my hand
Everybody was there, from junior high to high schools
Dyin to get busy, because I knew I had the tools
Then I got the heart and went by the set
I said, ""Yo, I wanna rock the set"" ""Yeah no sweat""
Kickin rhymes in the place, people couldn't take it
The style I flowed, the way I shaked and baked it
Later on I made a record, and got recognition
Everybody's jockin, now nobody's dissin
Written and produced by the new rap duo
Yes EPMD, now I'm known in school
I see the backstabbers, and the elderly creature features
That used to diss me, when I was tryin to reach the
Tip tip-top and I won't stop
To be the master, in the field of hip-hop
I did that, and got a name for myself
The image of E, and all of my wealth
I see my fake friends, but things ain't the same
Oh what a shame, I diss em
Who to blame? It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""

It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""

Before I cut records I had dreams of livin large
Earnin crazy cash flow, the whole nine yards
But when I told my college friends they kicked back and laughed
Said, ""You better grab your books and take your behind to class""
They said, ""You couldn't make a record and expect to get paid
Cause there's too many def rappers in the world today""
I said, ""Yo, my name is M.D. and my style is def""
They said, ""Your name is Parrish son, you're like all the rest
Frontin you gettin a contract, but then you 'fess""
But when you heard my record playin, your mouth was wide open
Your head was tilted back that you was almost chokin
But I just lounge, and cool with the fellas
Like my roomie D-Wade, Top Notch, and James Ellis
I never hung with girls, only one and she was mellow
First name was Terry, last name Romanello
My records started sellin then P withdrew
From the college Southern Con, known as SCSU
But when I often go and visit they say, ""P bust a rhyme""
I shake my head and then chuckle, and throw up the peace sign
They wanna feel my gold and sport my Rolex
But P reply it's really nothin, and don't like to flex
And when I step up on the scene I always hear them whisper
""Yo P's not the same, did you see him diss you?""
I go deep into my thoughts, then I questioned my brain
It wasn't me, the money, or the fortune, it was the ""Fame!""

It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""

Oh!
Now you wanna know me, before you wasn't speakin
Now you watch ""Yo! MTV Raps"" every weekend
Just to see me, the E, and the P
Coolin out on the scene, with Fab 5 Freddy
Back then you didn't know, that I was determined
To be a def rapper with the name Erick Sermon
To be a crowd mover, someone that cause trouble
Then I thought, and came up with E Double
I can't forget, how they used to diss
Sayin he can't rap, because he talks with a lisp
But I got paid, now you feel stupid
Amazed by the style the sound and how we looped it
Now I clock G's, trunk jewels, and star trims
Cool around town, and flex my black Benz
Definitely hooked up, with the system that cranks
Livin well off, with dinero in the bank
EPMD, is Erick Parrish Makin Dollars
Always on tour, so you can call us Rhodes Scholars
You saw me in eighty-seven, where have you been because we miss you
I dismissed you, it wasn't me who dissed you, it was the ""Fame!""

It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""

As I freak a funky style, to a funky fresh rhythm
I use my crazy def talent, that God has given
Me to flow slow, and still live large
To drop a def LP, and catch MC's off guard
Because my friends started buggin, we used to cool at the mall
But on the S.T., the Sneak Tip, they prayed for my downfall
I used to cruise by in my rock and always hear them mumble
""They got lucky on Strictly Biz but watch the next one crumble""
My father always told me to wisen up son
Cause if you hung with nine broke friends, you're bound to be the 10th one
So I cut my friends off, and P went for self
Me and Erick Sermon, and no one else
Strictly writin def lyrics to my best ability
With the crazy imagination as my only utility
Cause MC's around my way brag how def they are
But now they workin full time, and sharin their mom's cars
Always frontin to the girls, how hard you can rock
But you leave out how you carpin to go punch the clock
Yeah we came hittin hard, so all the talkin had to halt
But don't blame us, blame God, it's his fault
For assistin us on the mission of a point of no return
To do a crab MC, who did not learn
Now when you're hot you're hot, and when you're not you're not
And when it comes to funky music, the two rock the spot
So next time you see me coolin, bite your lip and respect
Between me and you sonny, straight up, I'm like death
I cooled on the Run tour, with Flavor and Chuck
Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince but I guess that was luck
I did shows in crazy countries, like Europe and France
Copenhagen, Denmark, and Amsterdam
I even been to our country, that they call Africa
Keep your eyes on your girl, cause P'll be watchin around the
Tick tick'n, yo check out P rippin
A new way to sway, cause brothers keep vickin
Flows and echoes, that sound exact
But you're rhymin in circles, and you ain't sayin jack
So take it in stride, by the way I'm still the same
First name is still Parrish, Sue's my girl, nuttin changed
You insist I act funny, but who's to blame?
It wasn't Yo! MTV Raps, the money, or Soul Train
It was the ""Fame!""

It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""","It Wasn't Me, It Was the Fame"
EPMD,"It's, time, to, party

""Now that I got your attention again I want to""

Party, party, party, party

Get up, shake your butts, feel the rhythm of the cuts
Walk around and strut, then a brother push up
And start talkin, girls and boys are hawkin
EPMD is live from New York and
Now I'm bout to rip house, straight up and jump
Move your body, as the bass pumps and thumps
This jam, is a crowd mover
For the girl and the boy with the funky dope maneuver
Or for a so-called dancing machine
Cause this record, is strictly for the club scene
Get Off the Wall, this ain't Michael Jackson
It's eighty-nine, it's time for some action
Like dips and dope backflips
While the girlies are movin, and groovin they hips
Enough booty, you could be waxin
Instead you in the corner, maxin and relaxin
Get up, and move your body
'Cause party people

It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party
It's time to party

Yo P break it down

Yeah

""Uno, dos, tres, cuatro""

It's time to party
It's time to party

Yo P break it down

Yeah
It's Friday night, no work til Monday
To top it off you just got paid
So you step to the club, boys and girls are GQ
Before you go in, you drink a brew or two
Strobelight spinnin, people grinnin
You're coolin at the bar, drinkin vodka and gin and
Your body gets warm, your adrenaline is flowin
People on the dancefloor sweatin and yellin ho and
You see this fly cutie
With crazy hips, plus a nice fine booty
Your mind gets to scheamin, you start dreamin
The liquor starts talkin, you get more self esteem and
You step to this lady, ""May I have this dance?""
Then she takes you in your arms and she grabs your hands
And while the disc jockey's yelling GET UP, GET UP
GET UP, GET UP, and on the dancefloor
The ladies are freakin moves, you never seen before
Cut up shirts, miniskirts, the whole works
Squeakin moves that make you squint and say
""Damn that must hurt"" stomachs are showin, aces blowin
And while you're havin fun, spendin your dough and
You reach into your pockets, you reach deeper
And off goes your money beeper
Which means you're runnin low on the dough
So you cool with the drinks and you limit your hoes
You grab a seat in the corner, and play low key
Askin yourself over and over how you spent a G
Don't worry now, worry on Monday
And get back on the dancefloor

It's time to party
It's time to party

EPMD,"Hello hello, may I speak to the E?

This is me, is this the doctor M.D.?
Yo P it's kinda early, who's there Laverner and Shirley?
Is it Kate and Allie, or some other girlie?
Well anyway, yo P you know I'm lazy
Callin me this time of hour you must be crazy

Excuse me, but I'm sorry E Double
It's a terrible situation and it might cause trouble
Throw on your coat jump in your Benz and come over

Why P?

Yo, I think Jane is on my sofa

What?

Last night I was all alone
Couldn't watch the boob tube, because my fuse was blown
Picked up the bat phone, to drop a line to you
Maybe 10:15, or maybe 10:22

Where was I?

I don't know, you wasn't there
Threw on the link Rolex watch and fresh gear
I grabbed my key, along with the cash flow
Shifted out the door to the local disco

Where'd you go, not to that ran down pub

Hell no, I was coolin at a club
It was Spanish night, so I was drinkin Molta
Doing a little tango, plus a little salsa
Seen a fly girl, standin next to me
So I slid over to her very non-chalantly
She was DEF, body perfectly fit
She was packin, a 300-E with the kit
I said, ""Kitten, how ya doin miss?""
I said, ""Hello my name is Parrish""

""Hi, my name is Cris""

""Can I buy you a drink?""

""Yes""

""What will it be?""

""A martini and Rossi, Asi Spumante
By the way is that your Caadillac Allante
Parked outside right next to my Monte
Car? You can call it, my ex-husband bought it.""

POOF! My ego appeared and said it's time to go for it
""This place is a drag, grab your coat and bag
We'll have drinks on the house, back at my pad.""
We got to my house we walked through the door
Threw on ""Night and Day"" by

Al. B Sure

She grabbed me, gave me kiss on the lips
So I grabbed the cold booty and caressed the hips
I got ahead of myself, because I wanted to flirt
Took off the G-strings and the V-neck skirt
POOF! my ego appeared

Yeah it's time to do work

I felt the movement below so it's time to react
I went in my back utility belt and pulled out a jim hat
I bust a move, when it came to that
But then she freaked it, and grabbed the bozack
Started doin' it, then she called me the master

You got bigger, better, stronger and much faster

At first I laughed, as if it was a joke
But then my heart skipped a beat, and I lost a stroke
I said to myself, oh no it couldn't be
The J to the A to the N to the E

Yo P don't tell me it was Jane you were douchin'
With the Anita Baker haircut

Nah more like Whitney Houston

While the record's still playing to Al B. Sure's ""Effect Mode""
Stay tuned, to be continued on the next episode
Peace, I'm Audi 5000",Jane II
EPMD,"The employees of the year, yeah we're back to work
I took time off, while all the rappers got jerked
Due to the fact that they're whack and their tracks
Have to go back and stack 'cause they lack
The ingredients EPMD and Scratch for that
Yo, I'm the hip-hopper, plus the show shocker
Down with MD, yes the microphone doctor
One wrecks, the other destroys
And if you think that you're ready to mess (kill the noise)
We don't play when it's time to slay
I take a cut from my homey, yo, then I lay
back and mack and all the rhymes I pack
And wait for a sucker to jump and then attack

Well, I'm known to be the master in the MC field
No respect in eighty-seven, eighty-eight you kneel
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
Wax a sucker like Mop & Glow (that's word born)
Smacked a second time, but on a different assignment
And do a sucker new jack who needs a rappin' alignment
Cause I'm the cream of the crop when it's time to do a show
Girlies on my jock for my dope intro
As I glance at E-Double, kickin' microphone wrecker
Turn on my cordless, sayin' mic checka
To the ladies and all party goers
Some call me freak, and others slow flower
Brothers on my jock, for the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

Puttin heads to bed, straight out the box
MC's, are jumpin' out shoes and socks
I'm not playin', understand what I'm sayin'
Catch a sucker in my way, and I'm slayin'
Takin' no shorts, so I'm vital sign
You can tell by my lines that I'm gettin' mines
in eighty-nine, because I'm fine as wine
Sit back and recline, watch the sun shine
Take a stroll, listen to rock and roll
Catch a flick at the movies, dance a bowl
What I chose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh my style is def, and as deadly as crack

While I'm slayin' must explain, a sucker is the lame
Battle in the trenches where the funky be playin'
Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
A kin not blood related, but you can call us cousins
Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like I'm Housin', You Gots Ta Chill, and more
The proof is in the pudding (yo check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we was bold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'
So what you sayin'

Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes the Boy Wonder
No fouls no bleeps no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""So amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
Cuz me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
Cause you was Memorex, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all out battle, P comes out swingin'
Cause I'm just that type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
and get mines on time that's why most resign
Sit in my LazyBoy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine
So what you sayin'
So what you sayin'",So What Cha Sayin'
EPMD,"Just when you thought it was safe to make records
The rap duo is back, it's time to start wreckin
E Double swingin high, I'm swingin low
Washin wannabees down, with some H20
As I go blow to blow, toe to toe, flow for flow
(Any has PMD?) Hell no!
I'm blowin rappers off course, like the S.S. Minnow
That's not your rhyme sonny, so please let go my Eggo

""I hear voices sayin that's Erick Sermon""

Straight up, right now, I'm on a mission
Front face the center and face your competition
As I rock, you jock, and in shock
And have fear, when the E is on the spot
(You pulled the mic handle, Joker, Joker, Joker)
Yeah boy, you hit the jackpot
So chill as I flex my skill and rap talent
Smooth hardcore, no time for love ballads
I'm not kickin the slow jams that's cool
But nah the hardcore, that make the brothers act fool
That's the way I would want stuff lookin
The crowd yellin, and buckwhylin like Brooklyn boy

""EPMD is in town""
No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin necks!""
""EPMD is in town""
No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin necks!""

Welcome, and all aboard
Crab tried to diss, now it's time to score
People, tripped and flipped, when we splurged our gift
To get paid off what we made, and also uplift
A new way to sway, or should I say flow
To keep the ladies screamin 'OW', the brothers yellin 'ho'
Now hold the O, and give me an intro
A kick and a snare, now the green light to go
I flex a rhyme on a rapper then proceed to wreck
By break this mic in half, then put him in the yolk and snap his neck
When five-oh roll, they say what's the M.O
Another rapper was hit, by Mister Slow Flow
Cause on my second return, I had to come correct
Takin nuttin but bodies, on the Unfinished Business tip
I make the music, that makes a posse ill
In they Jeeps or playin ball, or ready to chill
Or maybe at the spot where you hang where it's hot
Drinkin quarts of Old Gold, in the parkin lot
But mainly at a concert where the place is packed
Brothers yellin 'ho', girlies on the bozack
The system boomin, smoke everywhere
People swayin side to side with they hands in the air
A posse digs the music so they want to roll
So they troop through the venue, scopin everyone's gold
But whether you in New York, Detroit, L.A. or Miami
Approach with caution, cause brothers pack jammies
In they coat pocketbooks, and even they jock
You on the wrong brother, and you bound to get popped

""I hear voices sayin that's Erick Sermon""

Hurry hurry and step right up
The best show on earth, EPMD yea word up
And featuring the man on the cut
He who don't believe can get the (macadamia) NUTS
So whassup homeboy, there's any static?
Do we have to draw joints and get dramatic?
Or can we cool and be jolly old chaps
Or break loose, pull out guns and bust caps?
Nah, I don't think you want that
So I cool, and instead I bust raps
Like check one two, and you don't quit
And match a funky dope rhyme that fits
I say a rhyme and change the whole subject
And still flow, and freak the whole public
It can't be done, especially by a crab MC
Who came out the crack rehab
You must be mad, in fact, kind of rad
You not a smooth criminal, you soft and I'm bad
Don't mean to brag, I'm just makin a point
Some say I'm def, the old school say I'm the joint
Fencin, no half-steppin, straight up and down
I gets mine, so you should cool and lounge when

""EPMD is in town""
No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin necks!""
""EPMD is in town""
No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin necks!""

SCSU!
EPMD's in effect
Snappin necks n cashin checks",Strictly Snappin' Necks
EPMD,"Yo, whassup moneygrip, it's the E on the trip
Not to Georgia, but Gladys Knight and the Pips
It's a one way ticket, to the highest plateau
For a smooth rapper, and for those that flow
So blow like the wind my friend and take flight
And ""Fly, Like An Eagle"" yeah right
You can't rock a party and make hands clapper
Cause you an N.R.er (that means a Non-Rapper)
So give it up sucker duck emcee you're not ready
To flex yet, or better yet rock steady
With the E Double, number one on the planet
Take it for granted, I'm in control like Janet
I'm in command, plus full of fun
But don't play me, cause if you do you gettin done
And that my son comes to one conclusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion

Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion

Knock knock (aiyyo, who is it?)
The one who storms on rappers just like a snow blizzard
Yes the microphone doctor's back makin housecalls
To crab emcees, who claim to have the balls
To flex with the man, with the rep for snappin necks
I'm not the one son, so don't pose or make threats
The PMD, yeah Paid and Makin Dollars
Stranglin emcees with the microphone cord and make em holler
I'm like, Quick Draw McGraw when I blast past
An emcees ass, then trash crash to smash his ass
And play his ego, while I sip a forty-oh
And count my cashflow, because I'm on the go
And aiyyo I don't joke, and that you can bet
I flex a rhyme on a rapper, play his posse and step
Like I said in ""Strictly Biz"" I'm known to cause an illusion
To create total chaos, no mass confusion

Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion

No magic tricks, Houdini, or I Dream of Jeannie
Or disappearing acts from here to Tahiti
It's a one two three count, and I'm knockin out
Without a doubt (Why E?) I got clout!
Homeboy you should know, I'm de commando of rap
Carry emcees no trees, across my bare back
I use measures, and yes all are drastic
For me the E Double, cause I'm fantastic
So, I let you know, money I don't play
Step back and you won't get smacked, hear what I say?
Lay low Afro, or take a nightcap
And if you tired (yo, then go take a nap)
Or close your eyes and chank em like a Jap
Then lounge, as I rock across the map
Yo watch me go, flame dust in seconds
Me and PMD and the sound from our records
Check out the beat and the style I'm usin
It's total chaos, no mass confusion

Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion

Last rhyme was for E, this one's for the Gipper
Give me room, 'cause I'm about to rip a
Emcee's head off as I release my steam
The method of decapitation, is the guillotine
So check out the tempo, and let your body go
Cause a brother like MD's about to go Rambo
A Microphone Doctor, an emcee physician
An all around scholar, a rapper technician
So put up or shut up, cause MD is like fed up
You, your wack crew, your whole damn set up
Suckers still slippin, you better get a grip and
Change your wack style while the clock still tickin
Cause pursuin and doin a brother, is second nature
Can you feel it E Double? (Yeah, somethin like)
To the Microphone Doctor, all rappers are obsolete
You lack style and composure, plus your rhymes are weak
I gave you all due respect, when I said mic check
You're still slippin Duke, it's time to snap that neck
Like I said in ""Strictly Biz"" I'm known to cause an illusion
To create total chaos, no mass confusion",Total Kaos
EPMD,"Yo, at a hip-hop club was a girl I met
She was hot you can bet, her body dripped with sweat
I kicked it to her, and her name was kim
She said let's jet because she was ready for the jim
Browski I doubt thee e would front
So like a real stunt, I rolled the blunt
She was ready, I could see in her face
So we stepped, and went right to her place
It was fat, she had a dope crib
She offered food, like some barbecue ribs
I said ""no thank you"" not now honey
How about some drink, yes some gin rummy
After that, come here and sit down
And put on tenderoni by mister bobbi brown
We waste no time, it was time to do it
Put on some james brown so we can get into it
No kinky stuff, like ropes or handcuffs
But when you love me please don't be rough
I said ""listen, I'll be gentle, I'll be very gentle
When I'm loving yoooouuu, when I'm loving yoooouuu
So I dipped, I abandoned ship
Threw in the anchor like on the boat tip
That's what I get for trying to be a lover
But never judge a book, by the damm cover
I'm not dissing, and I don't like fishing
But next time, I want to know who I'm kissing
You can call me gay or a tutti-frutti
But I won't touch it until I know who's booty

Well I was maxin one day just minding my own
Talking to e-double on my car telephone
When I seen this fly girl clocking my means of transportation
The look in her eye was the look of infatuation
So I put my car in park, turned my system down
I said ""excuse me, are you new in town""
She said ""it's funny you asked I just got here today""
I said ""yo, you need a lift because I'm going that way""
She said ""my mother always told me not to ride with strangers
If I did, than my life would be in danger""
I said ""yeah that's true, but I'm not you're everyday swinger""
To tell you the truth, I'm a well known singer""
Plus I was cold coolin
40 dog in lap
Rings on my fingers with my fisherman hat
She got in and said ""yo I never done this before""
I had to play my cards right to get my foot in the door
I said yeah, my name is parish but they call me md
For the way I hold the mic, and slay mc's
She was lost and replied ""you a medical doctor?""
I said ""close but no cigar, I'm the microphone doctor
Who performs open surgery, on mc's who are willing
Except to try same them, I try to kill them""
She said ""ooh that sounds exciting, please tell me more""
You mean how we pack concerts and clock 10 g's or more
We pulled up to her house and her moms wasn't home
And as we got to the door she sparked up the homegrown
I was with it, felling nice from old e
Ready to get busy, and wax a cold booty
We got to her room, it was time to max
Pulled out the jim hat and strapped the bozak
I hit the lights, and next was the sack
We started doing it, it was hard to produce
Because the booty was cold kickin like they call me bruce
I had to cover my nose, not to ruin the mood
Because I know I wasn't fishing but I smelled seafood
Smelled like shrimp or lobster, or tuna of the sea
And it wasn't worth catching the a-the I-the d-to the s-oh yes
The s is for safe sex
And as I glanced at the door, you that move was next
But she pulled me close, and said ""let's get loose""
And out of nowhere I yelled ""baby did you do""
She said no p, cause I'm not a swinger
I couldn't buy that as I smelled my forefinger
I was playing myself plus my style was cramped
I grabbed my keys and coat, and md broke camp
And as I walked to the door, the girl got moody
I looked her eye to eye and said ""who's booty?""",Who's Booty
EPMD,"Aiyyo whassup E man?

We went out that night

To a club downtown

That was very high class

And had boomin sounds

We went in

And we were dressed to impress

Fly women and girlies

Lookin their very best

We took a seat at the bar

Feelin brand new

Frank ordered drinks, no liquor

Just plain old brew

He finished it

Then he ordered one more

And another

And another

And that made four

He seen this fly girlie

Suave and deboinaire

Light skinned complexion

With long black hair

But this girl was ug-ly

I mean her body was through

But after four drinks or more

She looked like Paula Abdul

You know what baby? You startin to look good
You startin to look REAL good
You startin to remind me of that superstar, Paula Abdul

The party was over

It was time to go

You insisted on drivin

When we said no

Nah guys, y'know? I can drive myself home man
That ain't gonna be no problem
I drive better when I feel nice (Are you sure man?)
Are you kidding me man?
That stuff in there, that stuff in there taste like fruit punch
I could drink that all night

So you got in your car

Swervin on the road

There was a cop in the bushes

On radar patrol

The light turned green

And you decided to stop

It turned red

You took off

And got pulled over by a cop

You overdid it homes

You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink

But if you give me a chance, I can go home and get it
Oh what are you a wiseguy son?

By the time I got to Motor Vehicle, Motor Vehicle was closed
Oh it was closed?

Have you ever been coolin
On a Friday night
Wit your friends gettin wasted
Just feelin nice
You continued to drink
When you know you should stop
The next thing you know
Your behind is caught
Your body gets numb
So you slow up the pace
Your mouth gets watery
And you can't feel your face
You finally make it home
And the fun begins
You try to pass out
But here comes the spins
So you turn and toss
Then you toss and turn
Your head gets light
And your chest starts to burn
So you lay on your stomach
And you tuck in your chin
Pail by your bedside
Now the breathing begins

Oh, oh God, just let me get through this last one
If you let me make it
If you let me make it through the night God
I promise I'll never have another drink again
I'll never drink again, as long as I live

You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink
You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink
You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink
You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink

You overdid it
Hey yo this is EPMD tellin you not to drink and drive
Cause ain't nuttin cool about chillin in a coffin six feet under
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, this is Frank B
And learn from others mistakes homes!

And don't let peer pressure get to you
Cause it costs you, or your life, or somebody else's life
In the long run

And it's like that
And if you don't believe you can get the bozack

See-ya!

[Featuring Redman] 
Chorus: Parrish Smith (from 'So What Cha Sayin') 
Brothers on my jock for the way I hold a piece of steel (4x) 
So what cha saying 
Verse One: Redman 
I go wild as I sip from a cold Lowenbrau 
Set up rhymes like fire to gunpowder 
Boom  did the bassline crank 
From being rated are  from being top rank 
I'm hard like an erection 
Phrases might get too tough to break down in sections 
So I grab a pen and pad, I'm back 
to make a killer, similar to a backstab 
Don't arrest me, arrest my brain, it's insane 
If I'm booty, then I've been framed 
By an MC, who can't be the are-E-D 
Fuck wit me, you'll get slapped up and capped up easy 
By me and a tre-eight pistol, so vacate the premises 
Or ask for Mayday, Mayday 
For H-E-L-P, brothers tell me 
I'm electrifyin, similar to round three 
I don't brag and boast but smash and roast 
MC's wit degrees from here to the West Coast 
I'm miracle wit no abrakadaba 
Piece of membranes will smash like crackers 
Were they Ritz, Saltine, or Town House 
None of the above get caught wit the roundhouse 
Kick, blackflip, semifull 
My vocal chord prove my pull ain't bull 
I'm down wit the Squad, no more than four to five brothers 
Six or more, you seen got smothered 
By a fist of fury, next is the verdict 
Let's hear it from the jury 
Chorus 
Verse Two: PMD 
I'm a nightmare to rappers, terror to an MC 
Cold wreck the nigga wit the help of E-D 
Aggravation, don't need it, so get off my dick 
Master of disaster, no time for flicks 
Straight up be	-boy, Real McCoy like Bruce Leroy 
Strap the bozack when I'm stabbin a skeezoid 
Gangsta rap, it's Daddy Mack wit a bozack 
Roy the funk punk pumps skunk like a smokestack 
So swing low and lick up balls 
I'm like Scharzenegger, correcting shit in Total Re- 
call up E-D and the posse that's ten deep 
To wax a sucker nigga booty rappin MC 
So step off cause you gets no props 
So stick the fork in him, Redman (why) cause he's done

Verse Three: Erick Sermon 
I'm E-D, I belong wit the A-Team 
A one man wreckin machine, by all means 
Necessary, I destroyed on contact 
No fear, of getting killed cause I'm strapped 
The Hit Squad's deep, making it sweet 
to creep, on my crew so you don't sleep 
My mic is caffeine, similar to Maxwell 
Making it smooth for me, yes, to wax well 
And you might get scared and spark a stove 
Cause I pack steel but Hold On like En Vogue 
My swiftness, I got a gift not for Christmas 
God bless, mmm-hmm, can I get a witness 
I'm fresh like a bag of Chips Ahoy 
No toy, I'm a hardcore be	-boy 
Once again, I quote, I'm danger

And I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash, you ain't seen shit yet

Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately

I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
'Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin'
You should hope that disco appearance like broke

Mass destruction when I start crushin' and bustin'
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin'
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shits thick

I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by U.S.A. and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people

Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin' necks, bustin' caps and breakin' jaws

It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
To whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in the wrong camp, punk, stepped on a land mine

Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brent wood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some bullshit charge, mugshot on file

For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a Tech Nine
Yes the brother's back with no knife or axe
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack

Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene

That's James Bond, 007, with guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team

Got to give the people
Give the people what they want

When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night but no airplay in the day
I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from wack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV
Like Ed Lover and Doctor Dre from Yo! MTV Raps
A show, mainly for the black
And still we can't ill, cause to them that's wrong
'Cause like P.E. said, we're too black and too strong
But hey, what can I say
(Brothers and sisters) that's a price a rapper must pay

Got to give the people
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

Got to give the people
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

As airwaves collapse rap shows at a standstill
Some racial circuits the frequencies can't handle
The funk tracks produced by EPMD
But it's a fat jam, that will never win a grammy
Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead
Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead
And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president
And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence
Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand
And kill that no sir, yes sir, and thank you ma'am
'Cause the word is a luxury a black man can't afford
That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored
And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks
And if we let it, rap would be run by politics
I read it somewhere that every man's created equal
But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel
Which means next time, so observe these rhymes
And take a stand and go for yours 'cause I'm going for mine
That's why I

Got to give the people

Why is that when wrong is done by the black
It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked
By the press and yes, conflict is caused
By the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors
One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty
But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley
Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence
So (Fight the Power) and make them understand
But too much power and you might get banned

Oh what the heck, let's get married and have a son named Erick
No big deal, no sweat
I was in for a big surprise
And when I saw the judge hammer pass my green eyes
Brain-locked, my whole damn head was malfunctional
Cause I forgot to co-sign a prenuptial, agreement
Now her case is hard like cement
I have no files on all the money she spent
She has a car, nineteen ninety brand new jaguar
Fly kit, with chrome rims that's five star
That she bought, when I was away on tour
Hittin' my bank account, getting more and more money
She got paid, it wasn't funny
Talking to myself, oh you big big dummy
Just my luck, that I'm stuck with a marriage
And a baby, who lays in a gold carriage
Now I can't leave, if I do she gets half (not the cash)
Oh yes, the whole damn bash of money
So I chill, and act so sweet
Kiss her feet, can't picture being in the street
So I give a fake smile, and a fake laugh
Fake everything so I can keep all my cash
Fake talk, like I love you so much
But wishing, she gets hit by a mack truck
Next time, if there's one I'll know
That most women strictly out for the dough
They're called gold diggers

Cause she's a gold digger [Repeat: x3]

The p had a close call, quiet as kept I dated this
""fly girl""
Yeah, and almost got vicked
She had green eyes, thunder thighs, and a def body (so what ya saying)
Top it off, she drove a black Maserati
Chrome kit, with a smile I couldn't resist
I tapped e on the shoulder and said, ""yeah I got's to get this""
(p cool, she could be a gold digger)
Not with that smile and that stupid booming figure
Til one day, she spent the crazy dough
Ten G's on Levi's, cold went Rambo
But then she smiled, gave me a back massage
Gassed my head up, and said (oh p you're so large)
Like a jerk, I went for the line like a fish
But she was far from dream girl, and more like a death wish
She likes to sit back, lamp, walk on plush rugs
Whip my five-sixty sip moet and bug (so did you flip? )
Tried to but she cut me off
And said, ""guess what? "" (what) ""I'm pregnant"" (pregnant? damn)
Yeah and the child is yours

Some say it's chill  New York throw chairs 
The punk funk sound to make a sane man flip

Low to avoid the caps and blows 
By the gang bangers at the B-boy shows 
Wit the cops trying to control the crowd 
But they can't  systems crank ""So What ya Saying""'s pumping loud 
Blows are thrown, heads are flown like Pan Am 
Brothers licking off like the son of Sam and 
The bass continues to thump 
Some brothers hit the parking lot to go pop trunks 
Hoes are slapped, jewels are snatched 
Brothers are caught in the cross fire without no caps

""Niggas, Niggas"", yea, cold turn the party out

My life story I tell straight from the heart. 
When suckers tried to crash my shit straight from start. 
A young black kid destined for success, no Old Gold, no cocaine, or Buddha cess. 
Straight up hard work. No sleep and no shorts. 
Brainstorming with the skills that Pop Duke taught. 
To keep swinging yeah, and not to quit. 
Now I ride the Benz, you ride the dick, with your punk friends, 
Straight up pussy from Punk City, my attitude's fucked up and real shitty. 
From the back stabbers, yeah my so-called friends, 
Who swim in my pool. When it's time, flex the Benz, 
Around town, windows down at the South Town, Cool J tape or K-Solo, ""Spellbound"" 

With fly girlie's dipping, brothers gripping and sipping 
Old Gold, Red Bull, hands on my dick and 
I'm just lamping with my EK shades, truck-jewels, obviously the man's paid. 
But of course not, brother can't get his props 
Like for instance, when I cruise up the block 
In my 560 lamping on my Metro phone, chrome kit beaming all off your dome. 

But like a sucker, yeah, you looked the other way 
That's how I knew you're on my dick kid, but it's okay.
It's normal, relax, your whole head's busted. 
Caught in the rap skit, ya couldn't be trusted. 
Cause my sounds pound from here to Okinowi (kiss) peace and I'm outie! 

[Chorus: x4]

Stay tuned to this last episode, when I rock the house and the mic explodes. 
This is not the buck wild style that I be using, in fact black, it causes mass confusion 
It's a fallout, when sucker MCs and crowds call out my name, 
oh what a shame I got  

I'm not a new jack, my rhymes are not whack, and in fact, 
I'm like Clint Eastwood, instead of bullets, rhymes I pack 
In my flow gun, so son, ya better run, 
Cause when it comes to hostage and prisoners, we take none. 
We move wax like kilos 

And when my jam hits the streets, the sounds explode. 
Watch the right hook, duck the death blow jack, 
I wonder where the E and the P's at

Can they do it again? 
You bet your ass, black. 
See you in '91
Until things get the bozack.

Jay was cool, he trucked jewels, packed a nine mil
Yeah, and kept his Smitty's on his tool

Anyway Jay portrayed to be like gard
So we took him in, and put him down with the Hit Squad
His house was phat, full court in the back
Jacuzzi in his bedroom, a welcome on the doormat

Plus AZT, full house alarm system
One rottweiler, one pitbull, no one could vic him
Something strange about the crib, I had to think
Why the whole god damn house was dressed in hot pink

Three doors on the left homeboy, ya can't miss
My head was busted

I said, ""What's goin' on?""
I seen a douche bag, and Safety maxi-pad tampons
Left the bathroom, went back where I was
Tapped Jay on the shoulder and said,
""Eiyyyooo 'cause""
""I thought you lived alone""
""I do""

""Are you certain?
There's bras and leotards, hangin on the curtain
Yo Jay what's your problem, homeboy you look stunned
What are you doin? Put down that knife... where's my gun?""

EPMD,"Slow down baby

Cause you can get rugged, tough, hard like P
Tried to play my man but you couldn't touch me
You faggot, no comp' rapper on a quest
To get your head flown boy, you must be loc' on sess
Cause many often wonder is M.D. paid
You're God damn right punk, stay outta my way
Cause I clock G's while you clock Z's
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke MC's
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take note
A rapper suffered from bleedin, sprains and slit throats
Cause my style, deadly psychopath schizophrenic
A rapper choke like a carburetor, freeze up and panic
Cause I clock pesos, don't sell llello
'Nother word for cocaine mi amigo
That's Spanish, terminology for friend
Now sit back and ride my bozack as I send
Bass funk, with beats that thump
For speakers and amps, cold lined up in my trunk
My system's crankin my headlights are blinkin
Brothers ridin my tip L, at the same time thinkin DAMN
How could a brother be so nice?
Cause I'm the capital, P-E twice, M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write but then again some bite
And while you was bangin on tables;
I was bangin Snow White P!

Slow down baby

The Ripper, the master, the overlordian'
Playing MC's like a old accordion
I get the inspiration from unnecessary station
Them sayin I was vacationin'
You can't quote with your weaker throat
Tryin to sneak a peek at how I freak the notes
Major MC's become minor B-flats
So retire the mic, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're guilty - face down on the pavement!
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real God
The undertaker, droppin' thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mic down slow and careful
Cause mine is fully loaded and I got another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin'
Divin' and dippin' and givin punks a whippin' (aww shit)
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds or so
I'm down so that you clowns'll know
Me gettin burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the huh forget it I'm constipated L!

Slow down baby

When I come around homeboy, watch your nugget
A master on the beatdown, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security's packed and wall to wall can't fall
A rap tank is full so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium
Any whack MC that flexes, I'm creamin' him
Not with lotion, bust the motion
Flotation when I rock on the mic, I'm like coastin'
I'm unique, fatigued at my peak you still seek
A style cause yours extra weak
New method, to rip the stage at my age
And get loose and kick, like Bruce in a rage
I'm on a rampage

Slow down baby",Rampage
EPMD,"[Erick Sermon]
G, man, do I have the power like He-Man
To crack a wack MC's head, open like a pea can
Damn, my name should become Sam
But I prefer, a grand royal for the jam
I'm putting heads out, the guns I use to pump lead out
Hey son, I suggest that you head out
I total, cremate, striking mic flakes
I won't break, I make more nerds than a earthquake
Strong, got more strength than King Kong
I'm worldwide, I'm interviewed like Kaity Chung
I'm on now, live at 12, it's so dope
All the way to 4 o'clock, there no soaps
I'm able to rock the mic nice and stable
It's a chance that you might see me on cable
Vision, Showtime or HBO with the flow
Getting more play than Rambo
Hey yo, what a you know, party people, rap is outta control
Rap is outta control, it's definitely, fuckin outta control
Rap is outta control, rap is definitely is outta control
It's outta control, rap is outta control

Straight from the underground, where
universal beat down is a mush
Yo, I stuck crab MC, E (too late, he got crushed)
Was he a pop rap singer, R&B swinger
Fagot who jumped the gate and now you get the finger
In other words, it's absurd to try to get wit
The brother from Brentwood, Long Island, nicknamed Swift Lip
I'm too smooth and yes, I groove to the slam track
Wit a Beck's in my right hand, left hand on bozack
I moved on ya posse, first reaction was ""Oh shit
Let's do that brother, hell no (why) he's too quick""
So dial 1-900-55-eat-shit
I pack a twelve shot nine mil and yes I still kick
(What) ass like a jock (height) 6'3"" and stocky
(Rap name) not Balboa, so motherfuck Rocky
I'm the mainstream supreme, slamming like Aikeem
The Dream, and yes sometimes it may seem that

Rap is outta control [Repeat: x2]
Sure dude, rap-rap-rap-rap-rap, for sure dude
Rap is outta control, yes, yes y'all, yes y'all
Yes y'all, yes y'all, kick it E

[Erick Sermon]
I stand tall, I won't fall, I recall
Ha ha, your rhymes stall
When I bust caps, until they Kryptonite caps
I reign of steel, I swap bullets like that
I'm like, Superman, fly high up in the sky
And if you try to shoot me down, clown, I won't die
I cremate

[PMD]
I hate, let's exterminate
Wait for a second, E, time to debate
As I take my fisherman hat off, there's no hat
For an MC on a trail of a mad comeback",Rap Is Outta Control

Refrain: 
[Comin' straight from the Underground] 4x 
Erick Sermon: 
As I pump up a brand new funk swing  
and bring back the chill of thrill from B.B. King. 
Old fashioned is the way that I be waxin' a MC  
I bust a grill  and the reaction I check  
inspect  make sure the head's wrecked; 
[crunch] snap a neck for some live effects. 
A machine  my functioning  that's mean. 
I stay together  my man  like Al Green. 
I'm a slayer, the E-are-I-see-K and I'm back 
to attack a punk chump that ain't sayin' jack. 
Boom, I'm buckwild when I'm stoned, 
I close only one eye like a cyclone. 
So I throw on my black shades that's rhinestone, 
summer to my Benz that's outlined in chrome. 
I'm the Grand Royal MC, I'm no joke. 
I hit like a Phillie Blunt when it's toked. 
I smoke, an MC well-done, he gets done. 
I'm knockin' out wack MCs like Michael Nunn. 
Full-power, one punch, crunch, I'm throwin' bolos. 
I'm strapped heavy, my handguns that's solo. 
I'm packed when it's time to get down. 
'cause Erick Sermon's comin' straight from the Underground... 
Refrain 4x 
PMD: 
Okie dokie. My mind gets slow-pokey when I toke the 
bull from a Phillie Blunt and I hope me 
Old Gold is cold when I pop the cap. 
Take a sip and then blitz, then crack a back with a rhyme sack. 
'cause I'm too smooth, pay my dues, and can't lose. 
I'm Top Gun, pullin' bitches like Tom Cruise. 
And my main man, D-Wade, still gets paid. 
And in the off-season, we vacate in the shade. 
So all hail the Mary, crack the Moet, 
blast the boom-box, then act like George and Jet-son. 
'cause my style, similar to Tae Kwon Do, but hey-yo, 
I don't kick or throw stars, this brother flows 
to the funk track, with 808 drops for prop the top 
of druggin' or thuggin, D.T.s or cops. 
I say, no to blow and yes to cess and I suggest 
you put a buck on Lotto, and if you win, you should invest 
in a new grill, Bill, 'cause I rock non- until 
the Fat Lady sings, or Brooklyn starts to ill. 
There's a fat chance, with the brother bistro, 
'cause I'm the master of the quadraverb and the echo. 
There's no time to stop, so P keep on steppin' 
on the edge of the frame of the mind, the nine is the weapon. 
That I choose to squeeze when a brother acts wild. 
One slug to the head, mafioso style. 
You catch a Universal beat down with sounds that pound, 
watch yourself son, I'm comin' straight from the underground.

EPMD,"Let's get up, let's get down
Roll with the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound
Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station
For a whole new relation
Ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block
Pump Color Me Badd to the ah, tick tock
Let them know your logo, not a black thing
My background sing, my background sing for the crossover

The rap era's outta control, brother's sellin' their soul
To go gold, going, going, gone, another rapper sold
(To who) To pop and R&B, not the MD
I'm strictly hip-hop, I'll stick to Kid Capri
Funk mode, yeah, kid, that's how the Squad rolls
I know your head is bobbin' cuz the neck knows
(Not like other rappers) frontin' on they fans, they ill
Trying to chill, saying ""damn, it be great to sell a mill""
Thats when the mind switch to the pop tip
(Kid, you're gonna be large)
Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin' black lookin' mad foul
I speak for the hardcore (rough, rugged and raw)
I'm outta here, catch me chillin' on my next tour
From the US to the white cliffs of Dover
Strictly underground funk, keep the crossover

(So whatcha sayin) You wanna go pop goes the weasel
You know you should be rocking the fans wit something diesel
But you insist to piss me off black
So I flex the biceps so I can push em back
So real hardcore hip-hop continue wreck it
And all sucker MCs duck down and get the message
So ban the crossover, yo, who's wit me
(Hit Squad) yea, P, hit me

Another megablast funky dope style from cross yonder
(So help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda)
(Yo, from what) the crossover, yea crossing you over
Outta here, gone, peace, nice to know ya (see ya)
What a way to go out, no clout is what the fans will shout
Cause you got gassed and took the wrong route
Came on the scene, chillin', freakin' a funky dope line
But when they finish wit you (beep) flatline
Some say there's no business like show business
But if this the truth, please explain why is this
Rappers been around long, makin' mad noise you see
Still I haven't seen one rapper livin' comfortably
No time to pick and wish on a four leaf clover
I stick to underground, keep the crossover",Crossover

[Erick Sermon]
Well, it's the E wit the juice, I'm down to get loose 
Strapped in black wit the nine by the boots 
Hardcore funk that make ya want to pump a chump 
My posse's thick  so I will never get jumped 
The slayer, a beast from the east, I'm psycho 
If I had a glove, I would be Bad as Michael 
Some say, yo, I sound rugged 
Pack wit the ultimate rap wit the Power like Snap 
A.K.A. the Mic Wrecker 
A rap star wit the boomin style, black as tar 
Smokin, the E's no jokin, so don't trip or flip 
And make a hit, so bust it 
Some ain't feel the way I do when I get wreck 
No half steppin, I kick back like a weapon 
On the microphone, I delight 
And groovy, a California quake couldn't move me 

Get on down [x4]
It's going down [x2]

[PMD]
No lights, no camera, but lots of action 
No moonwalkin backwards, kid, like Michael Jackson 
Strictly funk flows and steel toed Timb boots to troop 
State to state, stage to stage, as I clock loot 
Black Asiatic, rapper fanatic, automatic 
Black nine mil is what I pack so kill the static 
EPMD quench the sound of thumps underground 
Ya stupid boy, no props here, you catch a beatdown 
The Squad still in effect, no record skippin 
Ya stupid boy, keep the track, still bullshittin 
Down wit the rap pack, still grabbin my bozack 
Here's a ticket kid to ride the Jim like Amtrak 
Got mad skills, hi-tech, been known to snap necks 
From eighty-seven to ninety-two, fourth cassette 
But now I'm Swayze, ghost, the rap host 
Who rip shows, from coast to coast 

Get on down [x4] 
It's going down [x2]

Yea, back to the picture, the scene 
It's me Erick Sermon, my M-16

I can just chill, pull out the smoke out 
One, no grill, no charcoal, no fluid 
Act like Bo Jackson, Nike, and Just Do It 
If there's a problem, the Hit Squad rolls mad deep 
So I can rest my head and get some sleep 
While the E-Double, takes a nap, no time to slack 
It's my turn to guard the fort, ready for combat 
Guns and violence, that we don't promote 
Just takin what's ours kid, chill or smell the gunsmoke 
As I pull out, squeezin like Mr. Charmin 
Destroyin posses of demo tapes like Agent Orange 
So chill kid and act like you know

I pack a Smith and Wesson on my right section 
I'm strapped at all time Jack 
Nine mills to gap  for a punk suck new jack

I also have a 12 gage shotgun for action 
So chill, back the hell up and get a grip 
Get off that, thinking that you're all that real quick 

Like the Rude Boys said 
It's written all over your face, punk, nobody's safe 
Nobody's safe chump, so keep your doors locked(4x) 

It's the hardcore rap music that make your ears ring 
Joys of funk, produce a song to make my fans sing 
Singing, swinging, hum along, thump my rap song 
I bet I get wreck on a DL, then the P's gone 

Poof, no phone booth, cape, or tight suit 
Dress in all black, black skullcap, black down goose 
To hide the mock bird, word, wit the pistol grip 
Squeeze em quick, show who's crossing wit the loose lip 

Because loose lips sink ships, don't need a ship to catch a nine clip 
I ain't going out on some bull
Bankshot, corner pocket, now watch me rock it 
Can't mock the rap style so, boy, stop it 

(So what's the name) John Doe, K it's a slow flow 
Swiss miff crazy, the boy's loco 
Like neon Deion Sanders, call him prime time

First thought's to wild, second thought to stay calm 
You have the right to remain silent 
Cool with the roughness, I ain't violent 
Reached for his nine mil, partner started smiling 
Shut up Mulley, turn around and keep your mouth shut 
Peep the neighbor's starin as he reached for his handcuffs 
Threw on the bracers squeeze tight to increase the pain

Sit up straight, state your name and your birthdate 
And your whereabouts last night about eight 
Slow down 
Slow down? 
Something's missing, where's my lawyer? 
Cop grilled me and said 
Yo there's your lawyer 
Things'll get rough so don't get tough and try to play games 
You're headed up North 
For what? 
You know homeboy, the death of Jane 
You must be insane with no brains sniffin cocaine 
And if I caught a body it'd be yours and not Jane 
Or Mr. Toughy, you wish you had a nine to bust me 
I'm mad as hell, I don't play, my name ain't Dougie

Swung for my dome, ducked and caught my damn back

Take him downstairs and watch him make sure you're armed 
Cop grabbed me by my neck pushed me towards the damn door 
See my homies, locked down on the same floor 
So you want to be a killer and run the streets bro? 
Didn't respond, just chilled to play his ego 
Stepped in the men's room, still filthy from the ill broom 
Hurry up and take a piss and stop stallin you damn goon 
That was the wrong move, how stupid, time to go for mine 
Not glacial time, but the black nine 
Gotta clear my name, been framed for the death of Jane 
Must make my move now or it's ball and chain

Got the feel like braille, stayed charged like a Duracell
The show-stopper, knocking cats out like Rock 'em Sock 'em
Can't stop him, so player hating is your only option
Hands quicker than Roy Jones with no headphones
BK Albany PJ's where my man zone
EPMD and Scratch, the quarterback
Melting wax, flipping more tracks than Amtrak

""Murder? Yeah murder one son, for the death of Jane"" [Repeat: x4]
Hey yo they came to my jail cell, and let me go on technicalities
The girl that got merked it wasn't Jane it was fucking Valerie
The prostitute from downtown, we checked the dental records
Found her butt naked, and on the side EPMD record
Two hours later on Greyhound, on my way now
Peeped the shorty up front, staring wants to play now
Set gets laid out, she black, draws the gat
Screaming 'lay flat' then bust a cap as she walk back
Remain cool, I want the money quality jewels
And anybody breaking these rules they get two's
This is a jack, pass the money back, no eye contact
Relax, and keep quiet and pass the bag back
to my accomplice, having no nonsense
That's when another girl pushed up, white girl on some calm shit
Thinking quick that's when the hammer went click
An off-duty P.O., licked off and touched first bitch, she fell
Hit the floor, she was leaking
My partner cock back, blast, one woman started screaming
Who's next? Who wanna flex? Cop in the seat wet
Licked another shot off, hit the driver then the bus tipped
Shit's thick, that's when she grabbed me took me hostage
Told me 'snatch the bags and don't fuck with my props kid'
Pistol still smoking, she kicked the fucking door open
Bus on it's side wheels spinning, with the engine smoking
Running on the shoulders, she put the gat in the holster
Played it cool, and never lost my composure
As screaming soldier got closer, I followed her to the
drop point, she took the leads off a Range Rover
and passed me the keys, proceeded to roll trees
Shorty gained her silence, guess what was in the CD
And as I did the knowledge the Jeep raised from the hydraulic
I'm thinking, ""Could this be Jane as my co-pilot?""
Time to activate, JANE on the license plate
Pushing ninety-five with no headlights, on the interstate
""Murder? Yeah murder one son for the death of Jane"" [Repeat: x8]",Jane 5

With more hype than Williams
Maintain millions so when the world get close to ending
My squad prepare for squad spending, I ain't begot no weapon
I'm lyin, get caught off guard I'm firin
Until I hear sirens, I'm gone with the wind
A black Clark Gable, doin 90 in the lexus sport a fat cable
Never hold nothing back, I get the stress off my chest
Fell this so all the envious hear this
I catch wreck any punk in my way I'm banded (why E?)
Cause I'm the last man standin

""Whatever it takes how ever it gots to go down, 4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound""

Make a nigga sweat below the waist line by my Johnson
Where the tools kept, who I be? The code name PMD
Casualty to an MC who try to fuck with P, or E-dub
Catch the burner with the snub, no love
A tight defence, like the glove, so bring it
Any song we drop I bet you sing it
Check the logo and slip up and get creamed kid
My pen is registered like Bruce Lee on loose leaf

The blunt, the weed, the hash
And then get right with my friends in the Benz
Smoke fill the car until I blind my lens
I lock down my status, I be the baddest
Yes the one that get you open the most outspoken

Shogun assassin, chinese connection, ninja maskin
We turnin to gravity, b-boy with the pants saggin
Ain't no stoppin, on the case like Johnny Cochran

Of the innovator, one, two rock roll bounce to skater

Whatever, I'm Smoking Joe when it comes to rap
I'm a professional, Tiger Woods I'm good

Time to black out, no doubt, people wanna know about
The inside scoop with the group, and are they comin out
Damn skippy I'm tipsy, high like a hippie
Don't take drinks from strangers 'cuz niggaz slip mickies

Use a different 9 to valoy, metal, money caught it in his velcro
Another shell split his elbow, a good fellow
Like jimmy chochimes, he tote two nines, two dimes
Caught the guard block and at the shoe shine
Yeah he just got word about his man james dean from queens
Hit a bank and shot a guard in the spleen
With bill blast, he made a dash smash the cash
Ran two blocks pulled off the ski mask
But then started flippin', forced in the phat whip and
People started talkin', po-po started sniffin',plus
He never hit james dean with the cream
So james put a hit to catch him on the scene
The police got a tip from a girl he use to run with
Sell guns with, trees and mack clips, yeah
She was nice, drove a 5-0 twice, on the cell all night
With more hoes than Heidi Fleiss
And the girl drove a black infinity, moving keys to kennedy
Different name everyday fake identity
They made a deal and copped a plea and turned state
So at the house the police wait with jeds caught him in his 8
50 that's how the streets be moving shiefty
Found billy and he slipped and paid quickly
Different day but the same song, life goes on
So watch the street kid, cause it's a put on

Shippin' two pounds of coke with 2 o.g.'s in his bear coat
Chrome neena, rollin' with this bitch named catrena
Undercover queena that pack a street sweeper
5 years for doin' fed time for extortion
And a jail up in boston for major jewel flossin'
Hits safes quickly can hear a black jamie summers
Pick the right numbers and have mad runners
Or hardcore lil' kim, queen bee bitch
Who never snitch, played the game and never rode the bench
Will swear up and down this bitch will kill at will
For her family, no fantasy, a james colamity
Time for the score, from hammerton to marine park
Gotta get there, before it get dark, we arrive
She reload the black 45, concealed by the waist line
And nows the time, she jumped out the car
In front was a hummer, two new comers, I never seen before
I approached tall joey ""who's those guys lookin' wise?
Had my black ass surprised.""
A-yo yo yo it's a set up, where's the doe, uh
Where's the loot, give it to me and don't get cute
Catrina pulled the weapon, shot joey
The other two guys pulled out and aimed, explain
Yo, she hid the two kids with joey, she didn't know
Cause she paid more doe for 'em
Will screamed ""you bitch!"" ""sorry"" she said
Then boow! will got lit

Off the Richter scale, blowing hotter than ever

Lost your mind and said, ""shit!!"" when we barged in

I ain't scared of you motherfuckers, can't you tell?
Girls lose to me when they groove to Maxwell, 
I got one life to live so I'm living
Got girls to be hitting more cars to be driving

We stripped too many beats to make too many niggas to break
No moves are fake, no warning shots fired blasting on crews like corrupt jakes
The black viper, scream on MC's and rhyme ciphers
More dangerous mind than, Michelle Pfeiffer
So skedaddle-daddle, you get rattled don't wanna battle-battle
Put one to your rhyme saddle, stompin through, like wild cattle

With big toys, bringing crazy noise and ruckus 
Shutting down crews and motherfuckers 
In low beta, not to be fucked with like the swamp gator 
Potato, on the barrel of the snub nosed when I blaze ya 
As I, dust bust, crush and rush 
Catch you flossing nigga, turn your ice physi' into slush 
So yo, what's the deally for really 
We rock nine untilly, grinding like Billy 
So niggas chill and spark the Phillie

Here's my card and on the back of it's my fan club digits 

[Erick Sermon] 
Uh, hey yo taking our spot, that's outrageous 
P and I stomp those who get courageous 
And microphones get rocked on stages 
Any book or mag, we on a few pages 
Not commercial, not fronting, and no movie 
I swear, cause we take it there 
Billboard's top ten, that's tradition 
Coming through blasting with mad ammunition 

[Parrish Smith] 
Five-alarmer, microphone bomber, woman charmer 
Night in armor, penthouse view, with the sauna 
God dammit, pass me the rock, and watch me slam it 
Jam it cram it, until you stupid niggas understand it 
It's been a long time, MC crabbing bitch niggas running
Wack MC's we straight stunning 
When we roll up, unexpected, undetected 
Resurrected, EPMD second wind, fuel-injected 

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon] 
Word yeah, tell em P, yo 
I never seen y'all before, when I came through 
With my dogs headbanging with the, Hit Squad crew 
Hardcore, we got biz from the get go 
Any beef with us, we ain't letting shit go 
E-Dub, no one replacing me 
If there's a spot, then find a vacancy 
Boy, I own my style, while y'all got leases 
I get the whole pie, while y'all get pieces 

[Parrish Smith] 
That's why we own, biting our shit, we don't condone 
News flash, Erick and Parrish, we got it sewn 
And like I'm Damon we Dash for the cash, mash for the fash' 
Bashing the rash, double up P, straight on smidash 
So stop playing, serious like So What Cha Sayin'?
In Apollo sold out with Redman, fucking headbanging

From an unknown rapper, but now the rapper's no thrill

This is the year for the barbaric and the cats with skills
Underground with the hoodie, fuck keeping it real
While you was pissing in your bed, we was making a mill'
Got up, with Erick Sermon, dropped ""you gots 2 chill""

Giving fake love, with fake hugs, to fake thugs
With fake mugs, running they mouth with the place bugged
And caught a slug, and no one see nothing but mask and gloves

I see a few clowns, so where's the steel at
Me and my boys are ready, aim that and hold it steady
For those who dream, believe I'm freddie

Put a peace sign in the air if you from the south bronx
And let me hear you say

Hey yo, I grab the mic and strike, explode and ignite
Off the head, reminscing about some shit last night
No dough, in the pocket but that shit's alright
And these fagots, always stress me so I keep my shit tight

I was hanging out late, creeping a quarter to two
Polly with cats, sipping on a 40 of brew
Pulled out the Dutch Master
Cause it's time to get on
Turned on the truck system to pump a hip-hop song
Five minutes later I see these other kids clocking
Meanwhile my niggas chalmed out with system rocking
Saying in my mind, who could it be?
As he got closer, I peeped, it was the E-Double E
I said, ""What up Duke?""

Yo, whats up Sundullah?
I have a girl and she wants me to duke her
Yo, why didn't you?

So can you make a bill and chill and survive in the rap field?
Flip deals, and cock back burners when the caps peel?

So don't front for me or the E, cause you know our steez

Epmd now, here to get ya
With a blow, you could of sworn Roy Jones hit ya

[Parrish Smith]
Cats can't hold me, Erick and Parrish, we hold the trophy
Scorn your team all day so I suggest you change your goalie
Cause I'm hype again, with e double, on the mic again
Crack a 40, spark a l, then pop a ? perkadan?
Straight off tiggy, riding shotgun with my niggy
No diggy, e and p tight like lenny and squiggy
Sundullah, no one cooler than the rap ruler
And to the cats out there fronting, yo, you can't fool us

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon]
Hey yo, stop, drop, and roll, we on fire
And we won't stop rocking til we retire
Who said we out of biz? that there was a liar
I'm Sammy Sosa, and P's mark McGuire
Home run hitters, with black tar beneath the eye
If you wanna hate me, do it now, try
I'm lethal, take it back to epmd third album
And do it for my people

[Parrish Smith]
I jump out the plane and hanglide
Hit the ice and slip-slide
Niggas don't get it, epmd status, correct me if I'm
Mistaken, currently record breaking and still baking
Like Kevin to footloose only difference we keep the system quaking
Dusk to dawn, word is bond
You fuck with epmd, Erick and Parrish, the shit is on
Cause we roll with a street team that donate posters
Quick to roast ya
Run up with the gat cocked back, clap, and smoke ya

At gunpoint, stripped and thrown out the car?
It's funk doc, you know my name hoe
My style dirty underground, or Ukraine po'
When it hits you, pain pumps cool-aid, through the vein and shit
Snatch the trap then I dash like Damon did
Doc, walk thin red lines to shell shock
Hair lock with fucking broads in nail shops
Hydro? got more bags than bellhops
Two thousand Benz on my eight by ten picture
Papichu', slaying gcrews in icu
Battling, using hockey rules
For Keith Murray, doc gon' cock these tools
Rollin down like dice in Yahtzee fool!

With ten kids with hammers, hooked to a camper!

Youth on the move, paying them dues, nothing to lose
Huh, street kids, broken and bruised, eyeing yo' jewels
Huh, bad news, baring they souls through rhyming blues
Hardcore! to make them brothers act fool
Hands on the steel, flip you heads over heel 
Smell the daffodils from the lyric overkill 
Feeling like the mack inside a Cadillac Seville 
Too ill, on cuts, the barber of Seville, fi-ga-ro!
The sky is falling, Geronimo!
I feel my high coming down, lookout below!
Hey yo! dead that roach clip and spark another
Chicken hawks, playing they selves like Parker brothers

The broke-assed, even rock for trailer park trash

Yeah yeah, she gave away my pussy I'ma kill her
John john phenom-enon, in japan they call me ichiban
Wu-tang clan, number won!
In the whole nine, I hold mine
Keep playing with it kid, you might go blind, jerk off!

Mrs. stop drop and roll, rocks top the told
Hot, even though dames is froze
Pop close range at foes, and blaze them hoes
Leave em with they brains exposed, and stains on clothes
Y'all better change your flows, hear how luck spitting?
Stay drunk-pissed in the s-type, stay whipping 
When the guns spitting, duck or get hitting
It's written, we in the game but ball different
Point game like Jordan, y'all play the role of Pippen
Style switching, like tight ass after sticking

Straight up back up I keeps it hard
You like to watch but can't touch this nigga
Or catch a charge
Papichulo, with karate chops, just like judo
Fucking coolo make you quit rap and go sing with menudo
Underground's where we live and that's where we'll be when you leave
Overachieve, I'd rather be rocking apollo creed
Time to speak up, fagot niggas dropping these weak cuts
We're the b-boys, hows about some hardcore in the speakers
For the mic dons,
Pmd shining with my stripes on
In the saddle, fuck around, get your shit rattled
No paddles up shit's creek when time to battle
Same place, same bat time, so fuck a bat channel
This nigga, object of game, get your pockets bigger
Biggie, pac, and eaze, one love, them still my fucking niggas

[215]
We don't need no gat, just cock me fucking back
And watch me spitfire my ? volerical? fact
It's a sign of a miracle that, my iron spitting
Ain't peeling your cap, me and the devil had a spiritual chat
Cause I'm eviler with lyrical rap
Than a black cat, on a black night, and I'm black
In the moonshining, I'm sipping starsky and hutch
While my rims blinding, while p rolling the dutch
Cause I'm too much for ma's and grandpa's to solve
Roll the windows to your cars, when out at large
Who the fuck's in charge? Charles Laston sauls
I got his mom sucking my balls like a fresh pack of halls
Right hand to Allah, I'm the roughest of the raw
Nobody's ever seen what they seen and never saw
When I jump in my car, they go ooh and ahh
EPMD, 215, and 8-off agallah

[8-off]
Yo 215, who the fuck was them cats up in the car?
One of them got a gat, the other one wanna spar
Jumping out the car, pop a trunk, swinging crowbars
Stick up my seeds in my fiends for the G's
People low self-esteem rocking the gleam, hotter than steam
When I blow off the top I got this cream like bill rothstein
And when I rob unique excitement is, why you scream
So put your hands together, get your mans together
Here's the plan together here's the gun together let's run together
Soldier mind crime nigga, bitch-down live nigga
8-off's gonna hit em like, five niggas, surprise niggas

[Erick Sermon]
Hey yo you hit em like that
I bust em from the back, to the extreme
Hit em up, make em scream like a bitch
And switch up, for the mix up, and dig a ditch up
And bounce, then for luck, I throw a six up
And hook off like prince naseem a head
Duck yo' head, or go inside instead
Step to me bourgeois? fancy as dandy?
You get killed, like you was jon-benet ramsey
And some of y'all just plain civilians
Talking shit, and never even seen a million
Acting like y'all Sicilians, when y'all niggas
With small figures, and chasing gold diggers
(motherfuckers) don't even come up to me yapping
Or you'll die hard with Bruce and Sam Jackson
Right now, you wanna duel, you fool
I'm a dog 4 life like my nigga ja rule
Who wanna flex, with the influential
With mad credentials on instrumentals we're too essential
The mic and the beat, now shit's complete
For me to kick your ass, for talkin trash, punk

EPMD,"Brothers things done got too far gone
(Tell 'em 'bout it)
We got ta let the girls know what they gotta do for us

Oh, what the heck, let's get married and have a son named Erick
No big deal, no sweat, I was in for a big surprise
And when I saw the judge hammer pass my green eyes
Brain locked my whole damn head was malfunctional
'Cuz I forgot to co sign a prenuptial agreement
Now her case is hard like cement
I have no files on all the money she spent
She has a car, nineteen ninety brand new Jaguar

Fly kit, with chrome rims that's five star
That she bought when I was away on tour
Hittin' my bank account, gettin' more and more money
She got paid, it wasn't funny
Talkin' to myself, oh, you big big dummy
Just my luck that I'm stuck with a marriage
And a baby who lays in a gold carriage
Now I can't leave, if I do she gets half
(Not the cash)
Oh yes, the whole damn bash of money

So I chill and act so sweet
Kiss her feet, can't picture bein' in the street
So I give a fake smile and a fake laugh
Fake everything so I can keep all my cash
Fake talk, like I love you so much
But wishin', she gets hit by a Mack truck
Next time, if there's one I'll know
That most women strictly out for the dough
They're called gold diggers

'Coz she's a gold digger
'Coz she's a gold digger
'Coz she's a gold digger

The P had a close call, quiet as kept I dated this
(""Fly girl"")
Yeah, and almost got vicked
She had green eyes, thunder thighs, and a def body
(So what cha sayin')
Top it off, she drove a black Maserati
Chrome kit, with a smile I couldn't resist
I tapped E on the shoulder and said, ""Yeah, I gots to get this""
(P cool, she could be a gold digger)

Not with that smile and that stupid boomin' figure
'Til one day, she spent the crazy dough
Ten G's on Levi's, cold went Rambo
But then she smiled, gave me a back massage
Gassed my head up and said
(Oh, P you're so large)
Like a jerk, I went for the line like a fish
But she was far from dream girl, and more like a death wish
She likes to sit back, lamp, walk on plush rugs

Whip my five-sixty sip Moet and bug
(So did you flip?)
Tried to but she cut me off
And said, ""Guess what?""
(What)
""I'm pregnant""
(Pregnant? Damn)
Yeah, and the child is yours
So to fellas, who wanna keep they cash
Or beware of the jack hammer and the helmet that glows
'Coz she's a gold digger

She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger

That's why, men in the 90's must watch themselves
'Coz ladies of the 80's got hip and went for self
With the new divorce laws, which entitles them half
That means the house goes

You and half your cash
What a price to pay, but if you play you pay
'Coz women of the world they got smart today
They flash a smile and profile
A pucker with a strut

Try to move in
Knock the boots
And got stuck with alimony payments
Time to meet Judge Wapner
You try to flip and cut, but she smiles 'coz she gotcha
You get a flashback to wedding, when you vowed the vow
Said the two deadly words
I do
But look now, you lost the house
The car

Eatin' TV dinners in a one bedroom apartment
Boy you picked a winner
But what goes around, comes around
That's why she wheels the Benz
And you ride Greyhound
Oh, just your luck, they on strike
Take off the wedding band, put out the thumb, time to hitch-hike
And the more you walk the pain from your corns get bigger

Not to mess with a gold digger

And just all of a sudden up and decide to rap
Ain't no disguisin' that bullshit, they ride to that bullshit
Who bought 'em that bullshit? Your mom and them?
She probably mad, 'bout to whup your ass for not again
But don't feel bad, you just tryin' to win
Talkin' 'bout designers and your diamonds what you drivin' in

And you ain't even behind the wheel, go to the passenger side of it
Tell me, why is that niggaz do that? That nigga ain't do that

Yo, aiyyo you learn from mistakes made
You're never free until your karma debt's fully paid
That's why you stay on the path that your parents laid
Cause you never know who could be friend or foe
Even got some fam hatin', yeah a brother know
They say who'd you put on and cold slam the door
In your face like they never seen you before
Like you ain't totally down to take 'em on tour
Now everyone got a business on the top floor
They say what goes around comes around quick
Me and E see it yeah we just laugh at it
We got past our problems in the past and moved on
That's why mics are gettin' wrecked and we gettin' strong
Cause the past don't matter so kill the chit-chatter

They whole madface get rearranged
Ain't that funny, how things are when it comes down to money?
Clouds turn to sunny
I'm always bummy, scared to put somethin' on fly
Cause they might want somethin' from me
See me on TV? That means I'm gettin' it
See me with a chick, they think I'm hittin' it
Well maybe that! But that don't give you right
To count my cash, or judge my past
That's my garbage pail inside, that's my trash
That's my safe, that's my stash, backstabbers

Aiyyo, they smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff because they don't have cash

I'm still fresh as the cars I'm drivin'
I'm on bay risin' high
I'm top villain
I get the money and I don't care
Handle my heart, I swear, yeah
I'm in my element
I hold weight, something like a elephant
Dub, the most creative, New York native
If Jesus died then who gone save us? you?
Label heads want me to Jim Carry the rhyme
On a down and get airtime
I can't talk ignant, no
I got some intelligent folks that's diggin' this
So that's how I'm givin' this

[Chorus]
Listen up, listen up
This is something that all you need to hear
Listen up, listen up
We gonna jump this off all night, do the thing all year
Listen up, listen up, listen up
We made it easy to dance to this
Listen up, listen up
Come on everybody sing it, dun dun dun

Shh, quiet, look who done stepped in the place
Its the bandit, mic doc, time pick up the pace
EPMD back in sake, we see the look in their face
Me and their haters the mans, the players and the fans
Already told the non believers that the lord have a plan
Look at here and the way spit, the flow is sick
Better tighten up your click, see what they doin', evict
Leave the back door open, that's the end of you shift
That's why we in, we hustelin', strong arm muscelin'
bustin' like we lookin' for weapons of mass destruction in
hoodies on, dressed in black
Fatigue camouflage, and power like we just came from Iraq
We learned not to look back, we turn the stone in crack
Its the return of the boom bap
Yeah HipHop is back, peep the track
It's P and the green eye, some Long Island guys
are you all surprised?

[Chorus]

Ayo, even though I never hear DJ sayin' it
Yeah EPMD is washed up and we ain't playin' it
Yeah, like I care, you ain't stoppin' nothing over here
I got four seats up in the Lear Jets
Bet I'm ok, you hate your
No payments, all ass payed for
Not the one to brag, but for you I dodged
Cause you don't respect, that's what I expect from you

Ask any cat in the streets and he'll point right here 
Shine everywhere I go without droppin shit for years
Niggaz know this nigga,
Come with the broken language like Smoothe da Hustler and Trigga
My bombs are bigger, cant touch a harmless figure
Cause is stay razor sharp like my name was RZA
PMD built a dynasty like Jigga


Yeah, P my nigga, time to cock back pull the trigger
he a bigger nigga with figures but I'm a bigger nigga
Duh, I'm a snub nose, I'm way above those
I got beef and I sit 'til the club closed
lights come on, I'm bombin
Viet-Nam-em, Napalm-em, AK I calm them
Mom like ""Who harmed them?""

I don't know, but they put em in the news and Saddam'd 'em
And nobody warned 'em

This is what it sounds like when you puttin' work in
Like Norman Bates pullin' back the shower curtains (Uhu)
Or like in _Headbanger_ black birds chirpin'
This is what it sounds like when you puttin' work in

Mausberg heavy (Check, puttin' work in)
Tec-9's steady (Check, puttin' work in)
Shotgun heavy (Check, puttin' work in)
Machine gun's ready (Check, puttin' work in)

We from the era of the red white and green sweater
Cream getter, gleam better
You know what? the team is clever
Fuck niggas up get drunk pull out a bigger pump
Sell crack, all day rep, rock the meanest leather
Flip you all day chump, mad make you pay
No doubt, gun in his mouth, he leanin on Broadway
HipHop gangsters for real, check the archives
Four Fives, knives, catch you in the sunrise
Powerful impact, boom, from the canon
This is not slain to take mine, take this ammo with it
Big boys, pretty boys, shottin' pretty toys
Pull out the new joints and lower the noise
The records that we make straight classics
Built for Benzes, Astons, high powered assassins

Uhh, you are now tuned in to a hip-hop movie
Starrin' two MC's, featurin' E
P-M-D, b-boys in the house
New York rappers, they play me in the South
So I don't have to do them, I'ma do me
Rock on to the break of dawn
Like PM Dawn, I get reckless, when I'm on beats
I show my true {Colors} when I'm in the streets

Yeah we step through militant, rain snow or sleet
Approach with caution when you see me on the street
(Who is that? HIT SQUAD) is comin' with the heat
The black sniper rifle lift you off your feet
Your head neck and arm be on the concrete
I'm on some Murdoch, I'm comin' for you, so don't sleep
Or wake up wit'cha wig split open like watermelon
There's no tellin', when you runnin' with them known felons

EPMD has been gone for a minute, time to jump back in it
And dot the I's and check the period at the end of the sentence
Discipline, meditation, repentance, gave us clearance
in the re-entrance like a futuristic extension
Need I mention our catalogue and what I'm benchin'
When our name comes up yo there's always tension
Don't get hit with the lyrical lynchin'
Get at you at the park like in ""Baby Boy"" don't let me catch you flinchin'

I got the mac no need to back down
Wake up niggaz, EP is back 'round
You my son, I'ma call you Shaq now

Yeah! Newsflash, just in for rap

You can walk it out but do it the other way

Out the gate, we come with the 8-ball

G boys, I bring it back to a droopy rope, dope
I sport like I if I spit the commandments
So inspired, now who the hell your man wit?
And he's gangsta right?
He belong in a dimwit type
You picked the wrong night
I'ma Las Vegas fight Don King in the ring
Does my thing from father spring, that's all year
I can feel in a wannabe rapper turned actor
He wanna act tough it hit him with the clapper
Def-con actor, see I ain't playing kid
He screamed and I'ma just saying he did

Cause someone might bite the dust
We don't rush shower

I be like fuck chill
Cats complainin' bout the game, pass the pill
EPMD is too real, y'all know
The only reason why you eatin', cause we payed the bill
How many times I got to tell you the shit shut down
'til Erick and Parrish return and hold the B-Boys down
Step through the door, hot body and lick off the ground
Uhu, I see niggaz listening now
Faces is wrecked like wild
There goes EMP with the fisherman hat

Can't hear you, you got to grade up, cause the beats too hard

I bring the heat quick
I do it, kill Ramone in Beat Street

cause most of y'all know cash like E-Zpass
You came in talkin' bout you gon beat me
Then you left out talkin' bout ""just give me two more CDs""
You're young so you need to be gangsters
While real G's wanna sit home and read the paper
Courtside view with the LA Lakers
But its always some youngin' you got to send to his maker

EPMD,"Yeah
Something has to be said
Uh
Somebody tell me something
Whats up?

That it's on right now and we about to let off
And that the industry is sleepin' and Hip Hop is soft
EPMD is the boss like Rick Ross
We don't knock or ring or else we kick down the door with force
Bust you down, leave a sign on you that say you lost
Game over, no more quarters, plus the machine is broke
Money don't really remember nothing, all he has seen is smoke
No witness, no statement, no case
Incorporate you eat cheese, then you get a raise
Rubbed out return to the earth
Six feet deep in the dirt
With the snakes and maggots cause you got murked

Yeah, and they keep telling me that
You're only as good as your last record
And if I was to do something now they wouldn't second
Hardcore respect it and that is enough
You got more props then call your bluff
Same thing happened to Marry and Mariah
They both came back with fire, fuck retiring
I got belts around my waist
You keep holding your pants up
Homeboy male up!
That's your opinion, cause you're not feeling it
How you know they're hot the fans not hearing it
The record pins steering it in one direction
You, there is some music in the real niggas section

That EPMD is a corporation it's not its the group
And that they always stack paper so put up your loot
Ghetto celebs that's why niggaz salute
Orange juice and grey goose
We dramatic backwards now that P is loose
Me and E is back for the kill, no troops
That's why we spit the real in the vocal booth

Yeah so called gangster and you ain't even hard
So called boxer and you ain't even sport
When them ribber hit you got punked in the yard
You said you got shot and you ain't even scarred
But they believe this and you keep betraying them
You are a bitch and I'm not the only one saying it

Now he from the BX but he really soft
And he from BK but his guns don't go off
He from cop killer Queens but he still getting robbed
And he from money making but he ain't on his job
Now he from LA but he's scared to bang
And he from Texas but he will do the damn thing
He'd stay in VA but he is scared of the streets
And he's from Chi-a but he's sweet as a peach
I can tell you 'bout the dope fiends and all of that

But I let them tell it 'cause they sell their moms crack
And that ain't gangsta that is wanksta
Went to jail and the homo shanked ya
Don't get caught between my city and the moon
You'll be screaming at night, you loose your life at me to doom
I really hung with BIG, squared off with Pac
Shook hands in the House of Blues before the shit popped
First fought niggaz in the industry and kept it cool
You ain't see me running my mouth in no interviews
And you fools on them DVD's waving tools

Any beat should occur, cock the four, for real
Last deal, I come out for the dumb out
Talk 'til my shells run out, then crop it
Like a movie scene and walk away clean
I'm mean when it comes to hardcore deception
Poker face swag, all in, I bet this
I done rock shit to present MCing
When I'm in the place its graced like I'm preaching
Everybody's ears are open when I'm speaking

Blinding where it fed the lust and steals the thought of man
Blinding where it seeds deceit in the waning lure of light
Blinding where it seals the fate - bringing the end of all!

Across Infinite planes

An ever-changing background
To the ouroboros tale

Immured in forgotten woods locked in eternal embrace
Yellow feral eyes linked with a crimson gaze
Glowing orbs seething, a time-immemorial lust

The sounds of bitter steel!

Blinding where it fed the lust and steals the thought of man
Blinding where it seeds deceit in the waning lure of light
Blinding where it seals the fate bringing the end of all!

Erase the Grey,"Everything she loved has left her 
In one way or another 
So blindly, she calls out 
In the middle of this sleepless night 
Those scars that dig so deep 
This piece of mind that's just not right 
She looks up to the sky 
She calls out, and she says 

My life is falling down like rain 
And I'll be the one to drown 
My whole world is nothing but pain 
And I'll be the one to drown 

Her eyes as blue as the life she leads 
Never thinking what she could have been 
Why me, she calls out 
In the middle of this heartless night 
How could the one she loves most 
Give her the pain she feels inside 
She looks up to the sky 
She calls out, and she says 

Let your rain fall down on me",Rain

Erasure,"Once upon a time
Science opened up the door
We would feed the hungry fields
Till they couldn't eat no more
But the potions that were made
Touched the creatures down below
And they grew up in a way
That we'd never seen before

[Chorus]
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature

They were angry with the man
Cause he'd changed their way of life
And they take their sweet revenge
As they trample through the night
For a hundred miles or more
You could hear the people cry
But there is nothing you can do
Even God is on their side

[Chorus]

Gods will break the ice, and throw it in the air
The creatures will decide who goes where

How can I explain?
Things are different today
Darkness all around, no one makes a sound
Such a sad affair, no one seems to care

[Chorus]

Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
Look what you've done
There's no place that you can run
The monsters made, we must pay

Maybe nature has a plan
To control the ways of man
He must start from scratch again
Many battles must he win
Till he earns his place on earth
Like the other creatures do
Will there be a happy end?
Now that all depends on you

Suddenly, as calm as can be, sky full of wonder tears me under
Fly through the cold, falling up to meet the road

Some time with me
Oh baby dream, won't you come and share the world with me

I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night

He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
I had to listen had no choice

I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart was going boom boom, boom
""Son,"" he said, ""Grab your things, I've come to take you home.""

To keeping silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut

So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
'Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut

I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart was going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home.""
Yeah back home

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free

Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes, but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart was going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" I said, ""You can keep my things, they've come to take me home.""

I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"
Eric Alexander,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Eric Alexander,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight

Eric Alexander,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Eric Alexander,"From moment to moment every moment that I live
I live for every moment with you
To see you, to touch you, to imagine this will be
The moment when a dream comes true

Just an ordinary day becomes adventure
Such sweet adventure I never knew
And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you

So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store
From their vast mysterious sky

Eric Andersen,"You've long been on the open road you've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try

Hold me tight and whisper what you wish 

For there is no one here around

Oh you may sing song me sweet smiles

Regardless of the city's careless frown 
           
Come watch the no colors fade blazing
 
Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn 
                                    
In blindful  wonderments enchantments

You can lift my wings  softly to fly

Your eyes are like swift fingers reaching out
     
Into the pockets of my night


Whirling twirling puppy warm before the flashing cloaks of darkness 

gone          
Come see the no colors fade blazing

Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn 
                 
Some prince charming I'll be 
          
On Two white steeds to bring you diamond crowns
       
And climb your tower sleeping beauty 

Before you ever know I've left the ground

You can wear a Cinderella Snowhite Alice  Wonderland gown

Come watch the no colors fade blazing
      
Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn 
           
But if I seem to wander off in dream like looks 
     
Please let me settle slowly  

It's only me just staring out at you
          
A seeming stranger speaking holy 

I don't mean to wake you up it's only lonliness just coming on  
         
So let the no colors fade blazing into petal sprays
  
Of Violets Of Dawn
  
Like shadows bursting into mist 

Behind the echoes of this nonsense song

It's just chacing whispering trail

Of secret steps see them  laughing on 
     
There's magic in the sleepiness of waking to a childish sounding yawn 
          
Come watch the no colors fade blazing

Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn

I'm in love,

But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""

That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow

around the world and back again 
A heart as light as wings 
made of sky, made of wind and things 
She keeps things you don't know 
She shows things you don't show 
She never wants to see you alone 

Something in her smile 
tells you she will stay awhile 
Something in her style 
shines and sets the sun on fire 
Every time she's near 
is like music to your ears 
before you rise she waits 
   inside your eyes

   would you understand 
   Wouldn't it be easier

Florentine she leaves 
a trail of misty make-believe 
You know she holds the key 
and you follow her to mysteries 
There's hidden things inside

Eric Andersen,"Sitting here forgotten like 
A book upon a shelf 
No one there to turn the page 
You're left to read yourself 
Alone to sit and wonder just how the story ends 
Cause no-one ever told you child 
You gotta be your own best friend 

Sunny days  cloudy days 
Always seem the same 
If love were made of clouds I 
Almost wish that it would rain 
Even when the skies are clear 
The weather's always blue 
Every day would be nice If I had 
Someone I could come home to 

Love  is it really love at all 
Or something that I heard love called 
Something that I heard love called 

Now life can sometimes slip away 
And love can pass you by 
If only it had been another place another time 
Maybe there'll be someone who likes to see you smile 
Who will want to stay with you 
And be your friend for a little while 
Then wake up in the morning 
Feeling so alive 
Something you can hold on to 
Not a shadow by your side 
I guess that there'll be time to talk 
Of things that we've been through 
That special time when all is real 
To feel reborn  when love is new 

Love  is it really love at all 
Or something that I heard love called 
Something that I heard love called 

Then sundown comes around again 
You find yourself alone 
Wander through a sea of eyes but always on your own 
Was it really all you thought that it was suppose to  be 
Or are you just another face 
In someone's fading memory 

Love  is it really love at all 
Or something that I heard love called 
Something that I heard love called 

",Is It Really Love at All
Eric Andersen,"So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

When you saw me I was broken
I was scattered in the dust
Like the way you feel sometimes
when you feel too much
You put your hands around my face
like a circle 'round the sun
When I thought that it was finished
it had only just begun

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, again

You shine across the morning
as I turn to face the east
You told me how to give away
things never meant to keep
Your love is rolling like a wave
that breaks right over me
One hand can hold the ocean
but will never stop the sea

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

Your skin it looks so golden
standing naked in the sun
Your soul it feels so holy
as close as the earth can come
A wave can cut a stone to sand
and the wind can break your bones
I'm wondering how you're doing now
when you are alone

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, once again, once again

He was just a prisoner
Prisoner of your pain
Whose sentence was to serve you
Let you love again
If you go away
He'll still be singing in his chains
Behind the walls of knowing
There was no such thing as blame

Deeper than the ocean
Wider than the sea
The loneliness you harbored from
A love that was deceived
How did you ever know
What the answer couldn't be
The dying's almost easier
Than trying to believe again

Your eyes they are so empty now
So pale in the sun
Your heart it is so weary
From not wanting anyone
With every breath you take
It's for the love that didn't come
Still longing for the day
You thought your life had just begun",Lie with Me

Eric B. & Rakim,"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song 
'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on 
You sweat as you step about to get hype 
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic 

You're physically in this with me but how could you tell 
If it's meant to be hip hop if you're not mentally as well 
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured 
Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored 

If you just keep kickin' listen, to the mix 
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand 
Holds and controls you 'til I leave 
You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe 

The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then 
Bring 'em to the front 'cause my rhymes' the oxygen 
Then wave your hands, when you're ready I'll send you 
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue 

And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously 
And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be 
Rising to the top, and I came to drop it 
Catch it and quiz it, is my topic 

Universual 'cause I move everybody to come 
By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one 
You look around and see how packed the party starts to get 
I draw a crowd, like an architect 

The five borroughs react and all the islands attract 
And every state can't wait, so they attack 
Off a spot on the floor, squeeze in 'cause it's packed 
It'll be more room if MC's play the back 

I'm the are the A to the K-I-M 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am 
The microphone fiend if I was a fake 
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make 

I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite 
Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like 
The voice on the record, I see what you mean 
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream 

So just, give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it 
If not, into the crowd I'll throw it 
Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well 
Before I let go I'ma spark your brain cells 

I took time to write, tonight I will recite 
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight 
Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin 
MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin 

Home to tell a friend when the party ends 
""Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again"" 
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage, 
Tape by tape and page by page, 

When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix 
The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets 
Deeper and Deeper, I hope you understand it 
I made it up myself and I planned it 

For other MC's who waste time 
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme 
I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating 
The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking 

They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin' 
To get up on the microphone and then start takin' 
Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it 
So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet 

Attracted to a freestyle put in effect 
You listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet 
So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight) 
Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little, 

I want you to hear this perfectly clear 
Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea? 
I hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished this song

Eric B. & Rakim,"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song
'Cuz the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on
You sweat as you step about to get hype
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic
You're physically in this with me but how could you tell
If it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured
Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored
If you just keep kickin' listen - to the mix
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
Holds and controls you 'til I leave
You fall deeper in the style - it's hard to breathe
The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then
Bring 'em to the front 'cuz my rhymes' the oxygen
Then wave your hands - when you're ready I'll send you
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue
And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously
And even if I stop - the rhyme remains to be
Rising to the top - and I came to drop it
Catch it and quiz it - is my topic
Universual 'cuz I move everybody to come
By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one
You look around and see how packed the party starts to get
I draw a crowd - like an architect
The five borroughs react and all the islands attract
And every state can't wait - so they attack
off a spot on the floor - squeeze in cuz it's packed
It'll be more room if MC's play the back
I'm the R the A to the K-I-M
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
The microphone fiend if I was a fake
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make
I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite
Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like
 
The voice on the record - I see what you mean
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream
So just - give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it 
If not - into the crowd I'll throw it

Cuz mic by mic and stage by stage,
Tape by tape and page by page,

",As the Rhyme Goes On [Pumpin' the Turbo - Chad Jay in Effect]
Eric B. & Rakim,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking until I hit my last note
My mind remains refined, all kind of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Say indeed and I'll proceed cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
His fingertips sew a rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must have got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch with my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me",Eric B. Is President [Dub]
Eric B. & Rakim,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon 
As you hear it  pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow  
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control 
Your body to dance (You got it) soul, 
Detects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme 
I got soul
 
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul 

Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next? then you gotta have soul 
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you want to get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to MC is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the R's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'Cause almost anyone can relate to 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt? 
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, 
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

Thinkin of a master plan
Cuz ain't nuthin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin up with lint
So I start my mission- leave my residence
Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents
 
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin move but the money
But now I learned to earn cos I'm righteous
I feel great!  so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin this
Feelin out of place cos, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish
Cos I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
To now test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, cos I'm paid in full

Eric B. & Rakim,"Verse one:

Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause When i heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It simple ain't it but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long coz I'm a move on 
The dancefloor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

Move the crowd

Imagine me  wit the heat that's made by solar,
It gets stronger everytime I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut!
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric be	 is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing
Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees, I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven,
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving

Move the crowd",Move the Crowd [Beatmix by Democratic 3]
Eric B. & Rakim,"Follow me into a solo,  get in the flow
And you could picture, like a photo
Music makes mellow, maintains to make
Melodies for MCs, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting; I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it now it's a daily word
I can get illin' at normal killin'
Bambino along, Rakim'll remain calm
Self esteem make me super superb and supreme
Before a microphone, still, I fiend
This was a take, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I wanna see 'em keep followin' and swallowin'
Takin' the makin', bitin' and borrowin'
Brothers try and others die to get the formula
But I'm a let 'cha sweat.  You still ain't warm
You a step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posin'
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me, and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel adventitious at speeds around the universe
What could you say as the earth gets further and further away
Planets as small as balls of clay?
Astray into the Milky Way, world's out of sight
As far as the eye can see, not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare into the darkness, your knowledge: took!
So keep starin', soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the ""R""
This is a lesson.  If you're guessin' and if you're borrowin'
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin'

This is a lifetime mission
Vision a prison.  All right, listen
In this journey, you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep you movin' 'cause the crowd said so
Dance!  Cuts rip your pants
Eric B. on the blades, bleedin' death.  Call an ambulance!
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murderin' MCs
Let's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote
""Follow the Leader!""  ...Yeah, dope!
'Cause every time I stop, you see, just duck
As soon as you try to step off you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showin' and provin' and lettin' knowledge be born
Then after that I'll live forever.  You disagree?
You say, ""Never?""  Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory
Called by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I had to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember, you're not a slave
'Cause we were put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name
Again, somebody told you, a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted, it can't be changed with a
Switch.  Here's a lesson if you're guessin', if you're borrowin'
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin'

A fear if I freestyle lyrics-a-fury
My third eye make me shine like jury
You're just a rented rapper, you're rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when they fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every trade of my snake so stay awake
And follow and follow 'cause the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to Daddy...  Indeed!
The ""R's"" a rollin' stone, so I'm rollin'
Directs the tone then rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin'!  A brother said, ""Dig him?""  I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug him
It's a danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, to space it, grace it, change the tone
There's one ""R"" in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B., be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state.  Follow us.  Tailgate
Keep comin', but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up your group, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant.  Clap your hands.  You won a trip
The price is right.  Don't make a deal too soon
How many notes?  Could you name this tune?
""Follow the Leader"" is a title they task
Now you know; you don't have to ask
Rappers' rhythm and poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might get junked if you follow the records he wrecks
Until then, keep eatin' and swallowin'
You better take a deep breath and keep followin'

Eric B. & Rakim,"I'm rated ""R""...this is a warning, ya better void
Poets are paranoid, DJ's destroyed
'Cause I came back to attack others in spite
Strike like lightnin', it's quite frightenin'
But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park
Not a scream or a cry, or a bark, more like a spark
Tremble like a alcoholic, muscles tighten up
What's that, lighten up, you see a sight but
Suddenly you feel like you're in a horror flick
You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick
Music's the clue, when I come your warned
Apocolypse Now, when I'm done, ya gone
Haven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer?
This is the death penalty,and I'm servin' a
Death wish, so come on, step to this
Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
Friday the thirteenth, walking down Elm Street
You come in my realm ya get beat
This is off limits, so your visions are blurry
All ya see is the meters at a volume
Pumping lyrics of fury

Terror in the styles, never error-files
Indeed I'm known-your exiled!
For those that oppose to be level or next to this
I ain't a devil and this ain't the exorcist
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep a wink
The pain's a migraine every time ya think
Flashbacks interfere, ya start to hear
The R-A-K-I-M in your ear
Then the beat is hysterical
That makes Eric go get a ax and chops the wack
Soon the lyrical format is superior
Faces of death remain
MC's decaying, 'cause they never stayed
The scene of a crime every night at the show
The fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
It's only one capable, breaks-the unbreakable
Melodies-unmakable, pattern-unecscapable
A horn if want the style I posses
I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest
For those that envy a MC it can be
Hazardous to your health so be friendly
A matter of life and death, just like a etch-a-sketch
Shake 'till your clear, make it disappear, make the next
After the ceremony, let the rhyme rest in peace
If not, my soul'll release
The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated, I'm glad you made it
'Cause you're about to see a disasterous sight
A performance never again performed on a mic

Eric B. & Rakim,"I was a fiend before I became a teen 
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream 
Music orientated so when hip hop was originated 
Fitted like pieces of puzzles  complicated 
'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say  "" Yes y'all!"" 
They tried to take it  and say that I'm too small 
Cool 'Cause I don't get upset 
I kick a hole in the speaker  pull the plug  then I jet 
Back to the lab without a mic to grab 
So then I add all the rhymes I had 
One after the other one, then I make another one 
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done 
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine 
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean? 
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and 
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and 
Thought of, 'cause it's sort of...an addiction, 
Magnatized by the mixing 
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in 
The mic is a drano, volcanoes erupting, 
Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing 
Everything is written in the cold, so it can coincide, 
My thoughts to guide, 
48 tracks to slide 
The invincible, microphone fiend Rakim 
Spread the word, 'cause I'm in 
E-F-F-E-see-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly, 
But back to the problem, I gotta habit, 
You can't solve it, silly rabbit 
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when 
I fiend for a microphone like herion 
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix 
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix 
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of 
unawareness? Beware, it's the reanamator! 
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon 
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping 
You see a part of me that you never seen 
When I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend

After 12, I'm worse that a Gremlin 
Feed me Hip-hop and I start trembling 
The thrill of suspense is intense, your horrified 
But this ain't the cinemas of ""Tales From the Darkside"", 
By any means necessary, this is what has to be done 
Make way 'cause here I come
My DJ cuts material 
Grand imperial. 
It's a must that I bust any mic you're hand to me, 
It's inherited, it's runs in the family 
I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back, 
If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack. 
Now I don't want to have to let off, you should of kept off 
You didn't keep the stage warm, step off! 
Ladies and Gentleman, you're about to see 
A pastime hobby about to be 
Take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm 
Hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one 
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke 
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke 
More than cracked up, you should have backed up 
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up 
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber 
One on one and I'm the remainder! 
So close your eyes and hold your breath, 
And I'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death 
Before you go, you'll remember you seen 
The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend 

The microphone fiend",Microphone Fiend
Eric B. & Rakim,"How could I keep my composure
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure?
Release, then veins in the brains increase
When I let off, make a wish, and blow the smoke off my piece.
Unloadin', unfold and the rhymes are explodin',
And the mic that I'm holdin's golden.
Cordless, 'cause the wire caught fire like a fuse.
Gunpowder and the slightest bruise is a friction.
The outcome is there, so listen.
Here's the brief description:
A boom; then flame; then smoke; ashes a dust to dust.
Contact is compact when I bust.
Mc's are now in a massacre;
A disaster a... Master at fashion; a beat to death.
To a pulp, till it can't pump.
Speakers ain't sayin' nothin'.
Now the ball can thump.
As I'm lookin'; I stand like great buildings in brooklyn.
Then the stage is took, then
Havoc struck that could product a whole court.
Keep in touch with the mic when you're holdin', y'all.
Sumpin', and pumpin', and slobbin', and droolin'.
Nothin's pumpin'; who do you think ya foolin'?
Tommy Tucker, the neighborhood sucker;
What you oughtta do... is pick up a tempo
From what I invent, so hard not to bite, but you can't prevent, so
You start to kidnap.
I watch the kid rap.
When he get off he know he shouldn't a did that.
Minor, old-timer, weak-rhymer, stay-in-liner.
You won't be inclined to go, so, yo.
Maybe later you're gonna be,
But for now you're almost one of me.
Now the immature imitations taken from originations;
Made by tracin', and a little arrangin'.
So perform, if ya still ain't warm; maybe after
A roast by the host with the most; it's a musical massacre.

Never tired; don't even try it; keep quiet.
Like a storm, you could rain... but a riot
Remains; the gang's power just like the towerin' inferno.
The beat's gonna burn, so
Distance I kept; you better watch your step.
Volunteers go from here and get
Ya out of the flames.
Appreciate the temperature change.
Anywhere within' the range of Celsius;
Fahrenheit on the mic; mic melts; see it?
Burns soon as it's felt; see it's torchin', scorchin'.
Mic's pipin' hot; steamin' who's schemin'; now ya not.
James Brown must a been dusted,
Disgusted; now he can't be trusted.
Embalmed with fluid.
Static can cause an explosion; in fact, impact's closin' in.
Time was up, so I don't need a time bomb.
Beat gives me a heat-stroke when I rhyme calm.
Pull out the tool; sometimes I want to break, fool.
But I was cool, like one in the chamber;
Lets play a game of rhymin' roulette,
And put me up to your brain and name a rhyme about ya clout.
One mistake... Ya out.
If this imitation it can't be the same show.
Maybe what you'll find somewhere over the rainbow.
Courage, heart, brain, you need rhyme.
Turn on your mic; snap your fingers three times.
We gone, or the story won't end the same,
And you'll feel the flame.
The potion was weak; make another antidote.
What's the science?  Why can't ya quote?
Elements for musical intelligence,
Rhymes are irrelevant; no development
And that settles it.
Go manufacture a match; send me after a blast.
From the master that has to make musical massacre.",Musical Massacre
Eric B. & Rakim,"No competition 

... 

No competition 

... 

Competition is none  I remain at the top like the sun 

And I burn whoever come in the chambers of torture 

I caught ya  you shoulda brought ya 

Neighborhood to support ya 

No one in my path will withstand 

Under pressure the wrath of a swift man 

You name the day  the grounds to be neutral 

Speak your piece  the feeling's mutual 

We can go topic from topic whenever I drop it 

Try to stop it 

In other words, what the brother heard 

He tried to catch it, but what occurred 

Was too much weight for one brain to take 

Try to concentrate maintain then elevate 

Program an ounce from pound to pound 

The matter of weight can't hold my mind down 

Permanent damage, I do away with 

No time for fun, cause I don't play with 

Competitors, there's only one when I'm done 

Competition is none 

... 

No competition

Competition is none, I'm the soul survivor 

MC's get live but I get liver 

It ain't a Memorex, live in concert 

At every network, the are the expert 

Whoever goes against causes friction 

Introduction music where's the mixing 

Ra will never die, tools they never try 

To beat or defeat me, because whenever I 

Put poetry in motion 

From the Nile, then out into the ocean 

Three-fourths of water makes seven seas 

A third of land three-sixty degrees 

I circulate and remain to rotate 

Seven days a week at a quake or a slow rate 

Be prepared whenever I come 

Competition is none 

... 

It's no competition 

... 

Creator, the alphabets let's communicate 

When I translate the situation's straight 

No dictionary's necessary to use 

Big words do nothing but confuse and lose 

From the first step, a concept was kept 

To the end of the rhyme, it get more in-depth 

All thoughts I come across, my mind's the source 

Made by the are, of course 

Seven holes in my face as I'm lookin out my window 

Speak with the beat and it seem like the wind blows 

Through the speakers, I hear it so pump this 

And we can fill up the whole circumfrence 

With competition, on an impossible mission 

Comin up with nothin, keep fishin 

No runner up, just lost or forfeits 

They all get butterflies, soon as the dog gets 

Unlocked, lines for blocks and blocks 

Might be triflin, to call the cops 

Bring along paramedics 

But that won't help you, not even calisthetics 

I'm God, G is the seventh letter made 

Rainin on rappers, there's no parade 

So if you ain't wise, then don't even come 

Competition for this inter mixin is none

It won't be long then it's on with the show 
I'm late, so hit the brakes and park the Benzito

Sneak in the back door, lookin for the stage 
When I get on you react in a rage 
People from side to side and front to back 
won't dance, if the MC's wack 
The crowd go psycho even if I don't move 
Some like the groove cause I'm so smooth

Take it both ways, I'll be here when you're done 
Remember as the rhyme goes on it's rougher 
Soon as I stop, you had enough of 
Followin' footsteps, you better turn back soon 
Sucker MC's suck rhymes like vacuums 
The style remains the same, the words is changed 
Bitten, rewritten, recited and rearranged 
Sing along if your tongue is strong, it gets sore 
Sing when I'm gone and it'll break your jaw 
Wisdom flows so swift, I'm Asiatic 
Is it a gift, or automatic 
Static, I don't cling 
I got a tip of my own and I don't sing 
Don't understand, here's an example 
And why MC's and DJ's sample 
'Cause we don't have a band, it's just my voice and his hands 
That's what hip-hop was, it still stands 
The records we use are from mom's and pop's collection 
Find a break from a dope selection 
And go to the store, then buy one more 
So my DJ can mix cause that's what his hands are for 
Years later hip-hop got contracts 
The chance to put actual facts on wax 
A mind's the coach, the physical form's the team 
The top's the destination, I'm the cream 
And still I rise with somethin pumpin and somethin clever

Now who's the man with the masterplan? 
With stacks of verbal attacks so clap your hands 
Rhyme written in graffiti xeroxed on blueprints 
Students influenced are now a nuisance 
You couldn't fight it, you had to clap to this 
You got excited, you almost snapped your wrist 
The rhymes was written for the crowd's enjoyment 
When I'm with this you can't toy with 
The def jam juicer rough rhyme producer 
Loads of lyrics get you loose, then looser 
The man so smooth and world so rough 
Eric is throwin and sewin rippin restitchin the cuts 
Microphone your majesty, no one's bad as me 
Seems the tragedy, Rakim had to be 
Thinkin of some def view of a video 
Visions are vicious, and I'll let the city know 
Whoever's frontin they know, nothin to say though 
so lay low, musical forms are kickin' like Kato 
Don't get near it, hard as you ever hear it 
I know it's fearified, but don't fear it 
And try to predict which rhyme you can kick 
You're quick to pick your best, for the mic is lit 
Instead of goin' with the flow like you're supposed to go 
And enjoy the show and yo, put your hands together

Eric B. & Rakim,"Whoever underestimated, still waited
Pumping the radio, finally they played it
You wondered how come the album was late
I was giving you time to get the last one straight
The show must go on; I got something to dance to
Slow it down and romance to, and give me a chance to
Keep you in tune and up to par
Then you're doing it with the R
Doing it wit' the R

Something new and to keep you doing what ya doing
This is for you, and your crew, and for who in
The vicinity; I don't need no identity
I see hands in the air that means many be
Cooperating; I can't stop relating
Hip-hop is making more sense when I'm stating
Paragraphs of potential to prevent you
From using my instrumental; keep in mind I meant to
Illustrate another illa break immediately
Hurry up and learn the words, and repeat it wit' me
Then soon you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doing it wit' the R
Keep doing it; you keep doing it wit' the R

In the summertime, pockets bulging
Somethings's happening, then I'm indulging
Music is mine, Gucci seats reclined
Gold grill, a paint job will shine
Pull up in the park, and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm
Loud as a ghetto blaster, word is bond

Then the microphone fiend's in effect, still listenin? 
Pay close attention, never before mentioned 
Listen up I got a brand new invention 
Made from a musician it's notes are played crisp 
But listeners listen to what I wrote on a disc 
Copywritten but still bitten they almost sound like 
Almost pumpin', but it ain't down like 
A record's supposed to sound, watch as it go around 
Records are broken, smashed into the ground 
That ain't My Melody, brothers keep runnin' up and tellin' me 
Others are trying to flow smooth and steadily 
Potholes are left in my path then I crash and bruise

The chance to put actual facts on wax
A mind's the coach, the physical form's the team
The top's the destination, I'm the cream
And still I rise with somethin pumpin and somethin clever
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together

[eric b] clap your hands cut and scratched (7x)
[rakim] clap your hands... clap em, clap em

Verse three: rakim

Now who's the man with the masterplan? 
With stacks of verbal attacks so clap your hands
Rhyme written in graffiti xeroxed on blueprints
Students influenced are now a nuisance
You couldn't fight it, you had to clap to this
You got excited, you almost snapped your wrist
The rhymes was written for the crowd's enjoyment
When I'm with this you can't toy with
The def jam juicer rough rhyme producer
Loads of lyrics get you loose, then looser
The man so smooth and world so rough
Eric is throwin and sewin rippin restitchin the cuts
Microphone your majesty, no one's bad as me
Seems the tragedy, rakim had to be
Thinkin of some def view of a video
Visions are vicious, and I'll let the city know
Whoever's frontin they know, nothin to say though
So lay low, musical forms are kickin' like kato
Don't get near it, hard as you ever hear it
I know it's fearified, but don't fear it
And try to predict which rhyme you can kick
You're quick to pick your best, for the mic is lit
Instead of goin with the flow like you're supposed to go
And enjoy the show and yo, put your hands together

[eric b] clap your hands cut and scratched 6x

Eric B. & Rakim,"Whoever underestimated, still waited
Pumping the radio, finally they played it
You wondered how come the album was late
I was giving you time to get the last one straight
The show must go on, I got something to dance to
Slow it down and romance to and give me a chance to
Keep you in tune and up to par
Then you're doing it with the R
Doing it wit the R

Something new and to keep you doing what'cha doing
This is for you and your crew and for who in
The vicinity, I don't need no identity
I see hands in the air that means many be
Cooperating, I can't stop relating
Hip-hop is making more sense when I'm stating
Paragraphs of potential to prevent you
From using my instrumental, keep in mind I meant to
Illustrate another iller break immediately

Hurry up and learn the words and repeat it wit me
Then soon you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doing it wit the R
Keep doing it, you keep doing it wit the R

In the Summertime, pockets bulging
Somethings's happening then I'm indulging
Music is mine, Gucci seats reclined
Gold grill, a paint job will shine
Pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm
Loud as a ghetto blaster, word is bond
Records remind you of a madness
The moment it's played, you get gladdest
The return of the brother, keeping you up to par
And you're doing it wit the R

Born to be the soul controller of the universe
Besides the part of the map I hit first
Any a rhyme that I can adapt when it gets worst

The rough gets going, the going gets rough
When I start flowing, the mic might bust
The next state, I shake from the power I generate
People in Cali used to think it was earthquakes

'Cause times was hard on the Boulevard
So I vote God and never get scarred and gauled
But it seems like I'm locked in hell
Looking over the edge but the are never fell

A trip to slip 'cause my Nikes got grip
Stand on my own two feet and come equip
Any stage I'm seen on, a mic I fiend on
I stand alone and need nothing to lean on

Going for self wit a long way to go
So much to say but I still flow slow
I come correct and I won't look back
'Cause it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at

To be all I can be and more
And see all there is to see before

Called and go back to the essence
It's a lot to learn so I study my lessons
I thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me
I'm glad I listen when my father was rapping to me

'Cause back in the days, they lived in caves
Exile from the original man, a straight way
Now that's what I call hard times
I rather be here to exercise the mind

Then I take a thought around the world twice
From knowledge to born back to knowledge precise
Across the desert, that's how to store a radiant
But they couldn't cave me in 'cause I'm the Asiant

Reaching for the city, a Mecca, visit medina
Visions of Neffertiti then I seen a
Mind keeps traveling, I'll be back after I
Stop and think about the brothers and sisters in Africa

Return the thought through the eye of a needle
For miles I thought and I just fought the people
Under the dark skies on a dark side
Not only there but right here's an apartheid

So now is the time for us to react

My trademark was left throughout the projects

When I rolled 4, 5, 6, they go we know

Me and the rap's laid back 

Nonchalant and relaxed in the track 

Put together well  so it ain't hard to tell 

Easy to recognize  so my records'll sell 

On the microphone  well known with a low tone 

Show and prove when the stage show is shown 

All you hear is screams when I'm hit by the laser beams 

Ladies fiend  rappers are choosin up teams 

So who could beat up  just before we meet up 

Before I kick a rhyme, I kick my feet up 

to let you know, everything's under control 

Under surveillance, takin over your soul 

So let me handle this, gettin scandalous 

All my jams are hits, never plan to miss 

Crowd is captured, released at my permission 

Peep em, as I, keep em eager to listen

Opponents are found paralyzed from the mic down 

Left with a little sight ears still hear the sound 

Try to clear your mind but it's still there 

Give him about a year, then give him a wheelchair 

I damage and deteriorate, til your brain dead 

No huss cuss what I discuss'll bust his head 

Here's some hearin aids when your eardrums fail 

You get scars, so you could read it in braille 

Close your third eye, then I do body work 

And I keep the same procedure til somebody's hurt 

My DJ'll sew up cuts like an M.D. 

And I still move crowds like an M.C. 

Entertain and tear you out of your frame 

Leave you in a puddle of blood, then let it rain 

Then I get deep, so try to withstand 

on my level to think, or sink like quicksand 

He couldn't hang, so I cut the rope short 

Watchin em fall, cause they need more support 

This is the way that I done, all of my competition

Swingin back and forth, til you can keep the rhythm 

At the tone of my voice, you will become 

eager to listen dance in a trance til you see the 

are on stage, no cheers, all ears 

All three of your eyes on me, so it appears 

just like you thought it would be, but even better 

Live and direct on stage, instead of the 

radio or video or studio rehearsin 

I'm at my best in the flesh in person 

The main attraction, center of attention 

The crowd'll go crazy, soon as I mention 

it's time to communicate, so let's conversate 

I get my point across, when you respond I make sense 

So now we could continue the mission

I'll play in the NBA cause I'll slay 

opponents well, and also excel 

as a black quarterback in the NFL 

I throw to score so I can hear the crowd roar 

Keep em, out of they seats and on the floor 

And when I win, it'll pump my adrenaline 

My record is undefeated, and I'll win again 

I'll never lose or hear boos from the audience 

cause they participate, and applaud me since 

I bring em what they want to hear 

And they'll fill up the atmopshere 

with people that came to party, and have a good time 

So when I'm gone, I'm sure, you understood the rhyme

Eric B. & Rakim,"Me and Eric be	 was coolin' at the Paladium 
Seen a all world covered girl  I said ""Hey lady I'm 
Sorry if You're in a rush   Don't let me hold ya up 
Or interveen or interrupt  but

You got the look   I want to get to know ya better 
I had to let her know   but yo  I didn't sweat her 
'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein' 
Almost looked Korean  but European. 

When she spoke  her accent was self-explanatory - 
Even her body language told the story 
Her name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony 
I said ""My name is Ra - and this is Eric be"" 

Since the music was loud, I said ""let's take a walk, 
So we could talk and see New York. 
Show time doesn't start until one o'clock 
And once I entered your mind I wouldn't want to stop 

Caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same 
Calm ya nerves, massage ya brain 
Each mic is a mineral, poetry's protein 
Verse is a vitamin - Affects like Codine 

So tell me how you feel and I'll reveal 
A pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real 
She musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist 
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said 

[Chorus] 
Over Me, She's goin' crazy 
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy 
She said she'd have my kids and help me make my next G 
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony 

So I prescribed her, something to revive 
And surprise her, she's liver and much more wiser 
Than the light I shine when my brain cells spark, 
Come to me so we can glow in the dark 

And soon, you can represent the moon 
As long as I keep ya in tune 
I'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here 
Take it in stride 'cause it might take a year 

It's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun 
We got close and it was almost one 
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go 
Fuck around and miss the show 

So I told her to hold that thought real tight 
We can finish where we left off later on tonite 
Back to the scene of the crime on time 
As they introduced the 'Fiend of the Rhyme' 

She stood with a birds-eye view of me 
Thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me 
The back of the room I could see her eyes gloom 
Patient, but hopin' that the show was over soon 

As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row 
So I said ""let's go"" 
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore 
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore 

Besides I got places to go, ladies to see 
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me 
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed 
And couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm', I said, 

""I've been watchin' you, watchin' me 
Looks I received made it hard to MC 
I can take a hint, so I knew that she 
Wanted my ""Agony Agony Ag-on-why"" in her bod-why 

Showed her some sights, then I took her to the Condo 
She was pipin' hot, but I kept my calm So 
She asked how come I don't smile 
I said, ""Everything's fine, but I'm in a New York state of mind!"" 

As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some 
Champagne, she'll entertain then sing some 
Sentimental, songs real gentle, 
It hit the spot and you know where it went to 

As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin' 
I knew she was in the mood for somethin' 
So I laid on my back and relaxed 
It wasn't the Perignon that made her collaspe 

Over me

Rhyme everlastin  there'll be no part two 
Knowledge is infinite  once I start to draw 
A better picture for your third eye  if you're blind 
You know with a mic  I'm a black Michaelangelo 
I'm the brother who ideas are colorful 
Givin em insight  but givin em trouble to 
Comprehend cause they thoughts won't blend in 
They're pretendin, while I'm extendin

Changed the endin, at least you went out rappin 
Now I'ma tell em what happened

It was too heavy to hold, he couldn't pick it up 
Pass the mic, let him try to get paid 
He hit the stage, it went off like a hand grenade 
Now scrape him off the floor and off my list 
I ain't a soloist, I'm an arsonist 
Sprayed up, he said he was gonna do what? 
Played up, MC Grand but Pooh-Butt 
Stole his lady, and drove her crazy 
You asked me why - cause her man tried to play me 
I sent her back a nervous wreck 
And tried to put her back in check 
My speciality is masterin the female species 
I specialize in her, until she sees 
Where I come from, and why I came 
I tame the train til she manifest my name 
Fill her with life until she burst with energy 
Then leave her restless, cause a lot of women be 
Tryin to drain us, and leave us stripped dry 
Put holes in our pocket, but you ain't that fly 
I clipped your wings and bring you down to Earth 
And tell you what life is worth 
It ain't rings and things that's materialistic 
You want to pip on, imperialist with 
Food for thought, cause I'm the shelter 
I'll be your clothes, keep you warm and help ya 
Not to be hot to trot by a haunt 
And why do y'all got to flaunt? 
(""You gotta use what you got 
To get what you want"") 
Cool, I heat you up like a black mink coat 
Hug your neck like a fat gold rope

So the people in the stands'll know

You gets.. no.. credit.. til you get it straight 
Let's motivate 
No intermissions cause it ain't commercial 
If you want to break then I'll reimburse you 
I won't let go so my mic won't drop, cause

Better hold my mic don't blow again
Warned by alarms when the mic gets warm
Crowd'll get critical can't keep calm
Jet for the exit why hang around
Words that I found make the mic melt down
If you stay better cooperate 'cause I amputate
And whoever don't break I'm a suffocate
Leave 'em with asthma, you better pass the
Mic to the massacre master who has the
Power to build and destroy at the same time
So track the wack at the right, and exact could shine
Meant to beat overheat, but I won't stop
So evacuate the spot when the mic's hot
Switch it from one hand to another
And that's a hint, my brother, run for cover
'Cause I'm armed, my brain contains a bomb
As if I escaped from Vietnam
Some people label me lethal, lyrics I made then put beats to
Format, collapse, your lungs twist your tongues
You can't bump your gums off of none of the drums
Words that I made'll create an iller scene
Eric B. is the fly human being on the guillotine
Hook 'em up to a respirator, 'cause it's the mista suffocator
What I write is like shovin' a mic down your windpipe
Don't let him bit rhymes Rakim write
No mic to mouth resuscitation is necessary
No obituary, and if they're left, they're buried
As it strikes on the same mic twice and then
Cut it on, and I'm a strike again
I meditate off the breaks, till the place shakes
Then I make rain, hail, snow and earthquakes
Speak the truth, tear the roof off the mother
The stage is stompin' grounds
Run for cover

Evacuate the building, danger, 'cause I came to explain the 
Strategy that'll be tragic automatically
Havin' me to cause another catastrophe
All you gotta do is give Rakim the microphone
And the crowd'll yell ""Timber"" 
Buildings collapsin', rappers gettin' trapped in
Areas closed off, no one gets back in
So set up roadblocks, barricade the doors
Fade, put a detour sign on the stage
Hold my microphone as evidence, the weapon I use and been usin' ever since
The days in the park when, rap was an art then
Plus I was dominant, determined and dark-skinned
Makin' it hard to walk the streets at night
For those who talk the weak beats on the mic
Whoever's livin' large better wear camouflage
Prepare to be bumrushed when I yell charge
Surround by sound of the beat-down another brother
This is stompin' grounds, run for cover
Wheels or foot, better not stay put
Whole place shook till the mic's unhooked
Then you've got seven minutes to vacate the premises
Lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes
Don't act wild, single file to the door
No need for an encore, just clear the floor
'Cause my mic's about to self destruct
The stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt
So make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned
'Cause minutes from now it won't be standin'
Then send out and A.P.B.: All Poets Beware of a brother like me
Now how many rhymes could your man manufacture
How many bitin' MCs can I capture
Trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth
Take over their route, play 'em out like a Cub Scout
So leave troopin' for MCs at war
And if it's a battle let the crowd keep score
'Cause me and the drummer make drama, and that's word to mother

I reposess your indentification 

So hand in your application 

Put your mic on strike until you're unemployed 

Contract is up and I'm stampin it void 

Your selection ain't that selective 

So I'ma put you in your proper perspective 

On the dancefloor, and doin the SHAKE 

Ready to let em brake, set em straight 



[Rakim] 

Somebody said I set em up and pulled the plug on em 

But instead I let em go on so I could bug on em 

Go 'head and flow, cause I close the show 

Swing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow 

For instance.. once I commence.. 

.. the crowd is convinced 

So now you know who to put your money on 

Hurry up, before your money's gone 

Cause I'm the most common denominator 

Orchestrate a rhyme much greater 

I'm like a world almanac, so tell the media 

Givin em information like encyclopedia 

So bring a dictionary, so you can look it up 

so you know what I mean, when I hook it up 

No misconceptions although I complicate 

but this concept'll set em straight 

They even said that I was locked in jail 

So now I guess I'm out on bail? 

The only Island I was on was the Strong one 

And if I did my bid, it'll be a long one 

Cause if I sold weight, I'd be upstate 

in the penile, waitin for a brake 

Cause sellin drugs is for handicaps 

I got too many skills besides bustin rough raps 

If I go to jail, it won't be for sellin ki's 

It'll be for muderin MC's 

The beat'll take over your heart, then I start 

to cut em in half, cause rhymes are razor sharp 

Secure the exits, all MC's remain 

Cause we got a crowd to entertain 

And I know, when I go, I'll flow dangerous 

Brain'sll bust, what you tryin to explain to us? 

You got lost, and couldn't go on 

Came up short, so here's one to grow on 

Elevate off a high IQ 

In time, you'll find I'm true 

Cause once I start on a piece of art 

from sun to moon and light to dark I build the Ark 

Now you can float off the rhymes I wrote 

I'm sure that we'll hit shore without a boat 

You could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked 

Attacked with a torpedo, what did you expect? 

Driftin up the creek, without a beat or a paddle 

Castaway on a raft and stand fragile 

Rescue your crowd, which ain't a hard job 

Me and my knowledge put together, I'm a lifeguard 

Dealin with actual facts it sold out fat 

here and now, but I go so far back 

to bring you up to date, so we can elevate 

It's no time to wait, or anticipate 

Cause I'm never late, I'm gonna motivate 

So I can let em brake, and set em straight",Set 'Em Straight
Eric B. & Rakim,"See if you can step to this

(Back to the lab)

Now try to do this step (Back to the lab)
And make sure the pace is kept
And this ain't as smooth as I'ma get
Nice and easy but hard to catch on to
Move with melodies, rhymes to respond to
The mic's in front of me, so you know it's gonna be
Rough and rugged, plus I'm smooth as I wanna be
I'm somethin' like sippin' on Dom Perignon
So absorb the song, til the rhyme's all gone
My beats and speech original, you can't find these
Eighty-nine is mine, so is the nineties
Tellin you what you need to know and more
You're unsure? On tour, I explore
From street to street, to speak, from beat after beat
My cypher's complete, when I build with people I meet
So here's the info straight from the source in fact
Paid the cost to be the boss, step back!
Give me room to exercise the mind
Three-hundred and sixty degrees'll be fine
The weight of the world is what we hold
That's a six, followed by twenty-one zeroes
Six ? sums is a lot of weight
My truth is the strength and my thought won't break
What it take, concentration, to rebuild our
Nation but we got to have mind power
And we can make it work, because I know we can
And if somethin' go wrong, make another plan
It's up to us, so strive and be wise and
When we reach the top, don't stop risin'
And I'll keep comin' up with more of
The most requested songs that you all love
Reach out and touch the mic, take control
Still gettin' ""Paid"" and I still got ""Soul""
And the only thing I ever wanted you to follow was poetry
Mind takes X-rays, so listen closely
From the darkness came the light, clear out of a dark night
Now I'm here to spark the mic
Send out truth, for other groups and substitutes
With run-on rhymes and weak dubs and loops
They'd rather hear the arsonist, they insist
No need to reminisce, see if you can step to this

(Back to the lab)

Step back

(Back to the lab)

(Back to the lab, without a mic to grab)

So just step

(Back to the lab)

(Back to the lab, without a mic to grab)

Just step, the rhymes create energy
Charged up, by the cut, and it's sendin' me
For a trip through the mind so I can locate
A laid back rap at a slow rate
It ain't hard at all, cause I invented it
As the days go on, you hear them with it
Brother bustin' braincells, thinkin' of a rap
With the same old style, we had enough of that
We all need somethin' to step to
And don't forget to, cause I won't let you
Dance without hopin' that this come on next
And if it go off, the DJ can't flex
Cause here's the tempo, I'ma regulate the pace
Here's the step, go find some space
And what we gonna do is in unison, kick!
Shake your head, you're influenced with music
By now you're intoxicated, cause I prove I made it
The pep your step so soon you get rejuvenated
From side to side, you pause and clap
But if you came to rap (step back)

Eric B. & Rakim,"This is poetry in motion 
Try to catch on  stay close to the host 
And MC's try to make the road rough but I'm coastin 
Ladies hear the rhymes rub em on like lotion 

Hit spots soothin  can't stop movin 
Go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet I'm still coolin 
When I detain it's a brainstorm 
Never the same form  every brain I rained on is warm 

Takin a trip through Memory Lane to Melody 
See if you could tell if these thoughts to fell MC's 
Could do you justice, but you can't touch this 
Some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed 

I'm universal and much more merciful 
So versatile with the style it's reversible 
I get away even if I say a curse or two 
First, let me bust another verse for you 

Your arms too short to box with Ra so quit 
You don't want no kind of conflict 
Or you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped 
Pick up the pieces now ain't that peace yeah I'm hip 

Everything I said flows since my intro 
I plant a thought extend and then grow 
Holdin' my pen tightly it might be 
Controversy at first when I write the 

Chords of research don't just take it for granted 
When I'm gone my mind remains a planet 
If I keep buildin, and teach the children 
So when they read in between the lines it's filled in 
I break to meditate, not a peep, concentrate 
Till I'm deep awake, but not asleep 
At the same time risin and advertisin 

What is true, keep advised and you can stay wise 
And I'm untouchable 

Comin' over the bridge take a peak at the skyline 
'Cause that's how I shine not only when I rhyme 
My culture's makin me stronger, mentally 
Physically I'm powerful poetry now that could be 

Labelled as art placed in a museum 
Style'll make scenery, now you see 'em 
Exhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with 
Nothin illiterate it's facts I build with 

My mind's untouchable which means intangible 
Contents never dense it's understandable 
I study life so I can live it the right way 
No time to hear what another brother might say 

Why sell a capsule of crack I don't have to 
I rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to 
Put message on records that's graced with hard bass 
Smugglin' microphones, this ain't Scarface 

Whoever talked that talk, I want to hawk 
And don't try to Escape From New York 
Cross a 110th Street lookin for a problem 
It's Hell Up In Harlem, watch Ra solve em 

I hear the music clear as I get near 
The hundred and twenty fifth street Apollo Theater 
Take a step back when I rap I step up to you... 
I'm untouchable 

Put on my thinking cap pump the track 
Test your reflex relax but in contact 
You fold and lose control so hold your partner closer 
You're supposed to keep your composure 

But you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype 
It's like nitro opponents get petro 
Remember the trademark left by the are 
That's never soft or smooth it's comin off the hardest 

In effect, you could die-tect the imposter 
Takin my props, Rakim is still proper 
I'm a prophet, you can't stop it, when I drop it 
Everything I say, coincide with the topic 

Thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured 
Inside my brain it's all manufactured 
As we go deeper it's hard to find 
Don't even think about it, cause you can't read my mind 

It's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined 
In the mind with some kind of idea for 
The style I'm advertisin what is true 
Keep advised that you stay wise and the mind 

Is untouchable",Untouchables
Eric B. & Rakim,"Casualties of War! 



Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade 

Where's the enemy? Who do I invade? 

Bullets of Teflon  bulletproof vest rip 

Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips 

Cause I got a family that waits for my return 

To get back home is my main concern 

I'ma get back to New York in one piece 

but I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets 

Sky lights up like fireworks blind me 

Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me... 

President Bush said attack 

Flashback to Nam, I might not make it back 

Missile hits the area, screams wake me up 

from a war of dreams, heat up the M-16 

Basic training, trained for torture 

Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya 

Addicted to murder, send more bodybags 

They can't identify em, leave the nametags 

I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor 

CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X) 



Day divides the night and night divides the day 

It's all hard work and no play 

More than combat, it's far beyond that 

Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack 

Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego 

Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go 

But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall? 

Somebody give the President a call 

But I hear warfare scream through the air 

Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare 

A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme 

Something like Monopoly: a government scheme 

Go to the Army, be all you can be 

Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me 

So I start letting off ammunition in every direction 

Allah is my only protection 

But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same 

and this is Asia, from where I came 

I'm on the wrong side, so change the target 

Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant? 

Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America 

Now it's mass hysteria 

I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor 

CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X) 



The war is over, for now at least 

Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace 

It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about 

Whole generation, left in doubt 

Innocent families killed in the midst 

It'll be more dead people after this 

So I'm glad to be alive and walkin 

Half of my platoon came home in coffins 

Except the general, buried in the Storm 

in bits and pieces no need to look for em 

I played it slick and got away with it 

Rigged it up so they would think they did it 

Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet 

when THEY call, I'm going AWOL 

Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war 

when I don't know who or what I'm fighting for 

So I wait for terrorists to attack 

Every time a truck backfires I fire back 

I look for shelter when a plane is over me 

Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G 

Kamikaze, strapped with bombs 

No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam 

Did I hear gunshots, or thunder? 

No time to wonder, somebody's going under 

Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge 

Take control, cause I'm in charge 

When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor

Eric B. & Rakim,"Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
Let's trace the hint and check the file
Let's see who bent and detect the style
I flip the script so it can't get foul
At least not now it'll take a while
I changed the pace to complete the beat
I drop the base 'til mc's get weak
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep 
Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique

I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Party's, clubs and for cars and jeeps
The underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

They wanna know how many times 
I ripped and wrecked 
But the search is never found of the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces took the last to observe them
They couldn't absorb them
They didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience
Ears, for my opponents, it might take years
Pencil, pens, and swords 
Letters put together from a key to cause
I'm also a sculpture form with structure
Because of my culture I'm equipped to construct a
Technical style that'll be full of technology
Complete sights of new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek and peep the technique
Don't sweat the technique

I speak in discreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then completes
Compose with physique never weak or obsolete
They never grow old technique's become antique
Better then something brand new cause it's original
In a while the style, I have much more value
Classical to intelligent to be radical
Masterful never irrelevant mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs
For all the years you taught to sought the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

Eric B. & Rakim,"She asked could I keep the beat 
So here's the beat  every time it pounds  you get weak 
Comfy  embedded like a pillow  bouncing wit an echo 
My voice is moist  and plus mellow 
I got it going on  you're gonna want to come 
Skins is the drum, I said I'm the drummer  give the drummer some 
And we'll see if you can hang wit Ra 
Let's see if you can Shangri-La 
Easy... Like Tina Marie I play it slick 
Like Rick James, I'm the fire in your desires flames; 
I heat up your temperature, keep the tempo raw 
When you start to smoke, rest assured 
I start to think 'cause you're a singer like Anita 
High pitched like a tweeter, deep beats start to beat her 
Much harder than love taps, my rap's above that 
I get girls where I want wit a maze full of love traps 
But I don't want to fall in love 
I stand in love, good balanced wit a plan to shove 
A cappella as we start to speak 
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek then I complete the beat 

[Chorus:] 

Tempo's moving and I'm hoping it'll never fade away... 
The beat is grooving, words are soothing and please tell 
Me that you're here to stay 
In the morning and I'm hoping the morning come again 
Hold me close and give me another dose and 
Keep the beat don't ever let it end 

She said, ah, so far, you didn't miss a beat yet 
Pop in another cassette, then I'm in to wreck 
I'll give you a beat you never had before, 
I had to explore and came up wit more 
Deep trunk kicks wit a brick for a drum stick 
You know the song, don't hum along, come quick 
You lay like Sade, it feels like paradise 
At the top of the pyramid, we review new heights 
The scenery of Egypt, you and me as we get 
So deep in the groove, when you move, you get seasick 
You seen enough, close your eyes and relax 
Move wit the tracks and stay tuned for the sax 
The instrumental, enters your mental.. 
Tense but gentle and, sentimental, 
A cappella as we start to speak 
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek then I complete the beat 

 
She wanted the extended version 
So I kept splurging and add more words in 
Strong, the emotion, notions move and 
The poetry's smoking, potions soothing, 
There goes the moon, I'm far from done, 
Rise like the sun, here comes the sun 
And I won't stop 'till it sets and then 
Rewind the cassettes and I'm a play it again; 
But this time it's instrumental at a faster tempo 
All I want to hear is ""Yea Rakim, Go""! 
I work overtime on your body and mind 
Cause I'm incline to do both combined 
My job is never done but done well 
Horizontal or parallel 
A cappella as we start to speak 
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek then I complete the beat",Keep the Beat

If you like it accapella; soul clap will be sweet  

Almost complete. 

Feel the impact when it hit the street 

But uh  it sound thicker when I kick it wit a beat 

See I can let it speak for itself 

But every now and then  I need a little help 

Guess who  to the rescue ? Comp! 

Ripping up comp  I step and then stomp 

A spark scam'll skin the land like it's a Timberland 

Prepare the stage for Rakim to stand 

Then I pick a song, grab the mic, click it on 

Time to get it on, kick along 

See if you can move to the words I speak 

Pick up on a rhythm (kickin' wit da beat) 

My menta-llect gets warm, feed into your physical form 

You can't keep calm 

Get fit to the skit, try to hop on- 

Get up to the trick as I flip the script 

You're feeling rust like a thrust of an arrow, plus, 

You're looking through the eye of a barrel, Bus! 

Emergency! Take him to the operating room, 

Put him on the floor, let his heart feel the boom 

React to the wrath of a brand new song 

Then kick along 



Kick along (5x) 



A kick is a hip wit hop 

A pep wit step like the floor is hot 

I project a lot so you can use every kick you got 

But don't forget, don't kick when I stop 

I'm something like Simon says 

As I'm pumping hype rhymes in your heads 

The mic's a remote control and I'm pointing it at cha 

When I push buttons, you're gonna have ta 

Break straight to the floor 

'Cause I'm a make more 

Each one's composed in the shows 

And each one flows, how long, nobody knows 

And whoever try to take 'em, I'm a break 'em 

Drag it out of him, dehydrate 'em 

The beat makes the beat in your heart accelerate 

Your pulse is a drumroll, it's too late to wait 

A pen'll send adrendaline to ten 

If then begin to blend the smooth that's sent; 

That's to prevent you from getting asthma 

you try to keep up, because, the cut has ya 

Blood pressure to the point, never stops a drop 

Putting stain in the veins in the brain, ya blood clots! 

Too quick to pause it, you almost lost it 

So kick along to you're all exhausted 

And look what my data made! my power'll never fade 

I keep it energetic, or hype as Gatorade... 

Now kick it wit a beat 

c'mon, kick along 



Kick along(3x) 



They can't wait to kick steps to this 

So I make a skit just for kicks 

Syncopated, pausing though, 

Innovated 'cause the flow 

Melodic and melodramatic styles occur, 

Like a choreographer, my mind's a photographer 

Making music visible for the individual 

That gets visual 

What I manifest you express on the dance floor 

Pants get torn when the jam is on 

'Cause I kick rhymes until the rhymes kick back 

It's hard to kick that, where did'cha get that 

Here's the concept, part of you're concert 

Expect the expert to perfect and do work. 

Don't stop the song 'til I'm gone 

keep getting it on, kick it off with the horns

Rhymes'll punish 'em 'cause they don't undertsand 'em, 
I heat up his brain, then explain then I hand him 
A redhot microphone...that's how I planned 'em, 
Rhymes call information(?), unite midnught(?), 
Like a platoon putting bullet wounds in the mic, 
If ya curse me, it ain't no mercy, 
Give him a autopsy, killed by a verse of me, 
I took a kid and cut off his eyelid, 
Kill him slow so he could see what I did, 
And if he don't understand what I said, 
I'm pushing his eyeballs way to the back of his head 
So he can see what he's getting into, 
A part of the mind that he never been through, 
A journey is coming 'cause ya getting sent to 
A place harder to find but it's all in the mental, 
I ran a brainscan to locate his game plan, 
When I'm through with his brain he ain't the same, man! 
Did he lose his mind or lost in his mind, 
But this ain't the lost and found because ya can't find 
Your foundation; coasting, your mind is 
Drifting, in slow motion..frozen, 
Looks like another murder at the Mardi Gras, be	! 
Too late to send out a search party, 
Once ya out of ya head then ya can't get back, 
I give 'em a map, but he still get trapped, so 
Prepare the chamber, the torture's coming up, 
Trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's The Punisher

Kill 'em again! 

Dangerous rhymes (are) performed like surgery, 
Cuts so deep you'll be bleeding burgundy, 
My intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex, 
Your cerebellum is next! 
Your conscience becomes sub-conscious, 
Soon your response is nonsense
The last words are blurred, mumbled then slurred, 
Then your verbs are no longer heard, 
You get your lung fried so good you're tongue-tied, 
The couldn't swing or hang so he hung 'till he died, 
Reincarnate him, and kill him again, again and again, again and again
I leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him, 
I got a dead-MC'ing museum, 
When I create 'em, I cremate 'em and complicate 'em, 
You can't save 'em...there's no ultamatum, 
Mic's lay around full of ashes, with the victim's name in slashes, 
Got a long list and I'm a get every one of ya

Double oh seven is back... 

Double oh seven is back... 

[Rakim] 
I don't stress my day cause it's best to parlay 
I guess you could say I've been away 
I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant 
And fourteen hands comb New York for fans 
They make waves as they wiggle in my water bed 
Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread 
A mornin massage turnin into a real rough rubdown 
So I figured I'll lay around 
They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti 
It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me 
They know more than calisthenics as they worked up a sweat 
It wasn't even ten o'clock yet 
Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean 
They sweetly keep me squeaky clean 
I chill as they filled the jacuzzi 
I said, ""I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me 
Support my thoughts, cause I got a lot of writing to do"" 
They said, ""Cool,"" and just enjoyed the view 
It ain't hard cause it's miles from the sidewalk 
I'm overlooking every borough in New York 
The entire, Empire, State to concentrate 
For every rhyme I make 
So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune 
And just before they all cleared the room 
They said, ""We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure 
We wish you didn't have to leave no more"" 
But they want to go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door 
Double oh seven is back... 
Rest assured 

Double oh seven is back... 
Feel secure 
Double oh seven is back... 

I'm fillin up the page when I'm steppin on stage 
Got the people in a rage with they hands in the air 
Fellas sayin HO, everybody yellin GO 
Fly ladies in the house all screamin ""Aww yeah"" 
That's how they react when I attack the mic 
In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright 
Girls love to squeeze me real tight 
Double oh seven is back.. 
Ra has returned, to romance em, better than Johnny Handsome 
When I was young, women said, ""Damn son"" 
Ain't nuthin change but the year and I'm still here 
Come here dear and let me whisper in your ear 
Hug my words so I can taste your lips 
I set up hips like domino chips 
But I don't let em hit the floor 
And if you got sore, then feel secure 
Where's the pain, is it the spot you set us in 
Almost magic, better than medicine 
Take one of these and put your mind at ease 
I get more work than a lot of M.D.'s 
If I'm hawkin New York, or out on tour 
I express the raw dialect and explore 
But don't get fooled by metaphor 
Double oh seven is back 
Rest assured 

Feel secure 
Rest assured 
Rest assured 
Yo, feel secure",Rest Assured
Eric B. & Rakim,"No more time to pass time 'cause these are the last rhymes  
'Cause we're living in the last times... 
They want to go to war  more wars to come 
But most of us fight more wars than one 

Discrimination in the racial nation 
While they destroy our strong foundation 
Nature's balance is way off balance 
They tip the scale  now it's no more silence 

The hole in the ozone layer is outta control 
But they want to fight for more oil and gold 
Unemployment, I got laid off 
The streets is the last resorts to get paid off 

For more, more mint, no doe for rent 
I gotta shed blood to make a red cent 
Maybe I should ask the president 
Somebody give me the president 

But he don't want to hear it, it's out of the question 
'Cause in my section it's worse than recession 
So I go to a rich neighborhood and play Robin Hood 
Take from the bad and give to the good 

First I go to Bensonhurst, steal a Benz, snatch a purse 
Pick up my friends, that's when it gets worse 
'Cause I need government and they need government 
a lot of mint spent, now I gotta pay rent 

Who makes the most dead presidents in the projects 
You're gonna get robbed and wrecked 
I parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot 
Let's get him for all he got 

I approached him slow like I was a basehead 
Put the fo-fifth to his face and said 
You see those kids over there wit the hoods 
Walk to them real slow and give them the goods 

First the gun and the doe and crush the jumbos 
One false move and no one knows 
'Cause I got a silencer to hush the bust 
And I'm in a rush, so hush the fuss 

Plus the poison you fed will no longer spread 
You good as dead, I'm a fill your head wit lead 
That's when I pushed him into his building 
To murder him but I remember the children

chorus: 

We gotta teach the children everyday, keep a song 

Show them the light, teach them right from wrong 

Make some sense so they can carry on 

Teach the children 

We gotta teach the children so that they can sing along 

Understand the words in this song 

Can't be done when we're gone, so..."" 



Teach the children ,save the nation 

I see the destruction, the situation 

They're corrupt, and their time's up soon 

But they'll blow it up and prepare life on the moon 

Sounds like Total Recall 

But who gotta spaceship, you get it, we fall 

So hope for the best and expect the worst 

The end is near and it's you-N-I verse... 

The one's that interfere wit nature 

Labeled you limited and underrate ya, 

His plans over rule when he separates ya 

Now it's you-N-I verse, the one that hates ya 

So we gotta let them know, we're hip to the script 

Change the skit, or we're about to flip 

'Cause we want access to happiness 

Livin' the good life and much success 

Equal opportunity 

Self awareness and unity 

Education, the kids need a sculpture 

Teach them the abacus and their culture... 

And that'll help stop the robbing, raping and killing 

Poison neighborhoods are illing 

But they import more keys from across seas 

A drug disease hits the streets wit ease 

So keep on building.... 'cause we gotta keep building 

Till the answers are filled in 

And make sure you don't stop till then... 

And if you do, remember the children!",Teach the Children
Eric B. & Rakim,"What's going on? 

What's happening  it's been so long  what's going on 
And what's going wrong? The good old days are gone 
You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man 
You invented a scam even you don't understand 

You rig the enigma  can't figure it out 
You change the route  now you're in doubt 
You use to cut class  smoked grass  still passed  
Figured you was all that but that ain't last; 

The times is harder, the drugs is heavier 
You say whatever, the more, the merrier; 
Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes, 
Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes; 

No more good times, no more time, 
Too far to find, you're almost blind, 
You can't see what spot that the trap is in
(Hey bra!)What's happening! 

You had it mapped out, your plans get torn, 
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone 
You said you quit, stated your word is bond 
(Hey bro) what's going on? 

What's going on? 

My neighborhood don't look so good 
I'll find a way out.. yeah, I would if I could, 
But the government is doing a project 
so I live in the projects; 

Where we fight for elbow room to the doom, 
Try to live long but you die too soon, 
I might not be alive to see 25, 
Taught at ten to make money and strive; 

I sold tapes at school and made some ends 
Met a lot of skins and even made some friends, 
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run wit, 
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun wit; 

But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test, 
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress! 
And then shake hands like a man, 
'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand! 

But you had a one on one fight wit drugs, 
When we ain't cool no more, we buss slugs, 
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone 
(Hey bra!) what's going on? 

Yo, what's going on? 

The crime rate in New York State elevate, 
A city filled wit hate, more deaths accumulate, 
Drug wars daily, a lot of blood spilt, 
Kids on the playground shot down and kilt! 

Nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more
'Cause stray bullets explore! 
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely, 
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be 

Rubbed out in a quest for clout 
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out! 
Half of the projects is dead or locked up, 
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up. 

Human abortion create distortions
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when 
Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born!

I'm back baby
The year of the 9's
And I'ma have to make these motherfuckers a offer they can't refuse
y'know?

Ha, what's goin on?  Yo c'mon, you know it's on
I wrote a song, test my flow on the Autobahn
Make sure the force is right, I floss all night
Get off the mic it'll smoke like an exhaust pipe
Keep em in the lie-bury, studyin my theory
Ra theory get translated in Swahili
From the lands as far as Zanzibar
They understand the are, the man Allah
It's obvious why the copiers, they copy this
Soon as my data processes Y2K they floppy disk
Now who the hottest is?  How can it not be this?
Baby who the cockiest?  Papi is?  Gracias
Aiyyo, this be so, magnifico
Even my, typical, style difficult
Make a crowd go wild when I rip a show
Better stand back, this'll blow, you didn't know?

They show me love when I'm come through
Yo any club that I come to
I hit a microphone check one two
And they know what I want to do - flow forever

You ever witness rapport like this before?
It's cause y'all kiss the floor, say this my Lord
It's the chosen one, with the golden tongue
Flow for the old and young when I'm holdin one
In the front row sitty, we show no pity
Where kids get jiggy and girls are so pretty
The Wanderer, back from Casablanca
To stomp all, what next for Ra the Conqueror
So let's go, the best show will explode
No dress codes, they just pose in they best clothes
Girls get exposed when I show my rap expo
Will there be a next episode?  I guess so
Those that halved out, wanted to have clout
What they mad about?  Must be a cash route
MC's switch they style from they last bout
And I bet soon as they hear this they spaz out

[Chorus x 2]

[Rakim]
Wherever Rakim go, it's the God temple
It's simple, my M.O., no problemo
Been all over the map, even know where Hell is at
I did the welcome mat, and then welcome back
My flow is raw, they treat me like Mr. Know-it-All
They want me to show em all my brand new protocol
Excuse-a-moi, I make a move for Ra
You ain't soupin Ra, save the hoop-a-la
Let me find out you rhymed out designed out
Pullin dimes out then climb out, for time out
I'm at the free throw, playin ball, or cee-lo, I keep dough
Reloaded like Carlito, incognito
I be so, low key, women get nosy
I do a show they want to go see to get to know me
In the front row seat they cosy
Thinkin I'm givin them the bo-bo-bee until they O.D.

Spend G's like hundreds and hundreds like tens 
I get paid, Black, but laid back with mild manners

Out the lab with soul and melodies in your ear 
And just when it all seem clear I disappear

And I'm a rock a jam by popular demand 
You gone love this, it's marvelous, baby 
It gotta thug's twist-it start to get crazy 
It's off the meat rack- can't keep my peeps back 
Speak raps and I freak tracks for these cats 
I got a fetish for puttin' together words and letters 
It ain't all about the cheddars and y'all know where my head is 
Ghetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters 
And still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses 
What I don't do is talk about the same old thing 
When I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing 
I bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise 
'Cause the beat's bangin'- I'm born to blaze, baby boy

I spread a war, like never before 
Spit lead at yours like a ghetto braud raw at a 
She'll never pause 
With raw metaphors, I set it off 
But I just begun the best is yet to come 
Blessed with a majestic tongue since I was young 
But I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns 
Test the one, let Allah protect your son 
Cause something musical magician, the ageiathic author 
The microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor 
You can explore, every sentence is a tour 
The inventor is more than adventure 
You'll be blown away, and a zone ? 
It's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say 
One of my own displays like I'm known to blaze 
And I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray

I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas 
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of 
So I made some more to put the New World in Order 
with Mathematics, put your status above the average 
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics 
Cause new days is dawnin, new ways of peformin 
Brainstormin, I write and watch the night turn to mornin 
On and on and, I got the whole world respondin

People see me stop and ask me when the album droppin 
The wait is over, in-formation like a soldier 
like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older 
I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents 
My only challenge, is not to explode in violence 
I'm Asiatic, and blazin microphones a habit 
At least once durin the course of a day, it's automatic 
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharaoh 
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow 
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me 
You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi 
More thoughts than Bibles, recital - taught disciples

This is that lost ass track off-the-rack kind of a track 
You forced to rap, remember that? It's that 
You know where I'm at, there go the gat 
Pass me a bat, the kill-or-be-killed kind of attack 
Steamin' ___, speedin' navigatin' the map 
Negotiating with a chick, she got her head on your lap, ya hand on your gat 
Premeditated plan of attack, with two of your most deadliest mens in the back 
Comb the block, stop in the zone that's hot 
Get out like you own the spot, home or not 
It's that no mood to play, move out the my way 
Yo, I been whistlin' this tune from throughout the day 
Hey, yo, this is that ol' y'all niggas don't wanna battle 
Turn it up loud make the whole block rattle 
Boom boom- this one is gettin' blazin' hot 
Boom boom- make you bust another shot from the Glock

From the streets below to everything above 
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood 
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug

From the streets beneath my feet to the sun

And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs

Here we come now 
Turntable spin like a merry-go-round 
Never slow down, depending on how good your stereo sounds 
Set it, up in the hood where we go surround 
Tearin' through towns, turn 'em into burial grounds 
This is the track that made Theodore wanna scratch 
The track that caused the first kid to spin on his back 
And then we saw, kids spray-painting the wall 
While some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law 
It's no antidote it's what you can't provoke 
So just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke 
And take a real hit, soon as it bang you feel quick 
It's real thick, this is that ol' real shit 
This is the description of designs for you to listen to 
Reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular 
Keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee 
Have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40

Yeah kid, give up your riches 
Vicious, visions is not for motion pictures 
Unstoppable, rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas 
Or witcha missus, gettin tropical kisses 
Makin' faces, anticipatin' places her tongue hits 
Suck her neck or just peck, better to funk it 
The EP is in effect from dusk to sunset 
She want a rim shot all over her drum set 
Jump the bed rubbin' your head- it's rough sex 
50 ways to keep a love wet 
Down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset 
""Damn, baby, you ain't come yet?"" 
Hell, no- doomstick big as a elbow 
Gel soft, well blow, give him a minute, he'll grow 
And all you gotta do is play the track again

And fifty minutes for it to pass through my intestines 
So ask yourself a question?(What question?) 
Can the Canibus rhyme? 
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine?

Standin' out on the corner of wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband 
God dam eggplants, niggas getting' me vexed man 
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sav 
And I can't seem to get away from it 
I dreamed that I stabbed leviathan through the stomach, and ate from it 
In my past life I slayed hundreds, and in the life before that 
I played trumpets, to warn you that I was comin' 
There's one billion ways to die, and I already tried 
Nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine 
When I aim and fire my rhymes, like a hundred cannon balls flying 
Striking you one at a time, in a parallel line 
While the art of emceeing is steady dying 
Canibus and Rakim Allah is still in there prime!

Eric B. & Rakim,"Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade
Where's the enemy? who do I invade? 
Bullets of teflon, bulletproof vest rip
Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
Cause I got a family that waits for my return
To get back home is my main concern
I'ma get back to new york in one piece
But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
Sky lights up like fireworks blind me
Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me...
President bush said attack
Flashback to nam, I might not make it back
Missile hits the area, screams wake me up
From a war of dreams, heat up the m-16
Basic training, trained for torture
Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya
Addicted to murder, send more bodybags
They can't identify em, leave the nametags
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Casualties of war! (4x)

Day divides the night and night divides the day
It's all hard work and no play
More than combat, it's far beyond that
Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack
Area's mapped out, there'll be no, stratego
Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
But what are we here for? who's on the other side of the wall? 
Somebody give the president a call
But I hear warfare scream through the air
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare
A desert storm: let's see who reigns supreme
Something like monopoly: a government scheme
Go to the army, be all you can be
Another dead soldier? hell no, not me
So I start letting off ammunition in every direction
Allah is my only protection
But wait a minute, saddam hussein prays the same
And this is asia, from where I came
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target
Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant? 
Blame it on john hardy hawkins for bringing me to america
Now it's mass hysteria
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Casualties of war! (4x)

The war is over, for now at least
Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about
Whole generation, left in doubt
Innocent families killed in the midst
It'll be more dead people after this
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin
Half of my platoon came home in coffins
Except the general, buried in the storm
In bits and pieces no need to look for em
I played it slick and got away with it
Rigged it up so they would think they did it
Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet
When they call, I'm going awol
Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war
When I don't know who or what I'm fighting for
So I wait for terrorists to attack
Every time a truck backfires I fire back
I look for shelter when a plane is over me
Remember pearl harbor? new york could be over, g
Kamikaze, strapped with bombs
No peace in the east, they want revenge for saddam
Did I hear gunshots, or thunder? 
No time to wonder, somebody's going under
Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge
Take control, cause I'm in charge
When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor

I specialize in her, until she sees
Where I come from, and why I came
I tame the train til she manifest my name
Fill her with life until she burst with energy

Tryin to drain us, and leave us stripped dry
Put holes in our pocket, but you ain't that fly
I clipped your wings and bring you down to earth
And tell you what life is worth
It ain't rings and things that's materialistic

What's happening, it's been so long, what's going on
And what's going wrong? the good old days are gone
You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man
You invented a scam even you don't understand
You rig the enigma, can't figure it out
You change the route, now you're in doubt
You use to cut class, smoked grass, still passed,
Figured you was all that but that ain't last;
The times is harder, the drugs is heavier
You say whatever, the more, the merrier;
Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes,
Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes;
No more good times, no more time,
Too far to find, you're almost blind,
You can't see what spot that the trap is in...
(hey bra!)what's happening!
You had it mapped out, your plans get torn,
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone
You said you quit, stated your word is bond

My neighborhood don't look so good
I'll find a way out.. yeah, I would if I could,
But the government is doing a project...
So I live in the projects;
Where we fight for elbow room to the doom,
Try to live long but you die too soon,
I might not be alive to see 25,
Taught at ten to make money and strive;
I sold tapes at school and made some ends
Met alot of skins and even made some friends,
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run wit,
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun wit;
But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test,
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress!
And then shake hands like a man,
'cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand!
But you had a one on one fight wit drugs,
When we ain't cool no more, we buss slugs,
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone...
(hey bra!) what's going on? 

Yo, what's going on? 

The crime rate in new york state elevate,
A city filled wit hate, more deaths accumulate,
Drug wars daily, alot of blood spilt,
Kids on the playground shot down and kilt!
Nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more...
'cause stray bullets explore!
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely,
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be
Rubbed out in a quest for clout
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out!
Half of the projects is dead or locked up,
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up.
Human abortion create distortions...
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when
Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born....!

And I will try my best to be
To you no burden, weight, or beast
I hope it's clear and that you understand

You can feel it swell and rise slowly reaching out to find you
Open the door ain't nobody yours
So there ain't no reason to run from all you're losing

She was lying in the sand
Her heart held in her hand

To save a thing that's meaning to die
Do you try or walk on by

Among the throngs of old cliches
A gentle bird of grace and beauty
Came down to sing a sweet refrain

Won't you fly away with me?
Won't you fly away with me?

She circled over through the evening
As we traveled sorrow bound
And offered up her wings for using
But we could not lift off the ground

Won't you fly away with me?
Won't you fly away with me?

'Cause nothing here ever changes
It's the same old thing everyday
Don't you know, little birdy?
You're the only one worth your wait

Some people search every corner
To find the place where they belong
Many fall back out of order
Many more go down alone

So, won't you fly away with me?
Don't you fly away from me

'Cause all the leaves on the street
Are blowing 'round and the sky is gray
And if you leave, I believe
We'd all just wither and fade away

'Cause nothing ever changes
It's the same old thing everyday
Don't you know, little birdy?
You're the only one worth your wait

Eric Bachmann,"Floating in the cold water the ghosts of sorrow haunt the deep
Reaching down to drag the ruins and roam the lone deserted streets
Of an old abandoned temple buried in the narrow strait
Off the coast of Tarifa, Spain

Gypsies scatter through the desert across the Atlas Mountain Range
Hoaring remnants from the Devil from the Empires iron reign
While cluttered down the mouths of rivers widowed lovers bathe and clean
Silken scarves embroidered for their brand new Queen

And every time she rises up the ocean sinks
Her memory drags a drape of a thousand angry stings

And like the moon doesn't mind if the sun doesn't shine
The sea doesn't care if you're lonesome tonight
Like the love that she gives condescendingly tries
In its way to comfort you

Set adrift into her swarm-man o war
Caught up in her dangling sting-off the shore
Of a foreign brown sand beach as blue as bottles cover you

Many messengers and rebels have come and gone without a trace
And many more will come tomorrow and many more will be erased
Cause out beyond the docks of Rota upon the bottom of the sea
Along the miles of copper cable from the Gulf of Cadiz

They tap the lines to hear the sounds that start the songs the rebels sing
And drag a net to seine the bottom for the purse the bastards bring

And like a lion don't mind if a lamb takes her time
A beast doesn't care if you surrender tonight
Cause a beast knows she'll get what she wants in good time
What she wants all in good time

Seems like somebody s'til got chains on me

Well we got brothers killing brothers
Leaving young mothers to raise a family
We gotta stay together to make it better

[Chorus out]",Chains
Eric Benét ,"Ooh what you do to me (yeah yeah)
Quietly your silhouette approaches me
A vision far too lovely to define (hey yeah)
Tenderly you take complete control of me
The feminine seduction of body, soul and mind (yeah)

Touch me and I feel your femininity
Girl you're the lady women want to be
Softly you move when you're making love to me
Love me every night with femininity

A child of innocence is how you look at me
But it's the woman's touch that makes it feel so right (so right)
Your lips consume my deepest sensitivity
It feels so good it makes me want to cry (makes me cry)

Oh, oh, oh
Femininity
Oh, Femininity

Let me feel myself inside you once again
I love the way you say it's just for me
A lady in the purest sense of elegance
But when the lights go down girl you're making love, strong, wild and free

I like the way you take control of me
You have a little certain quality
Not many girls would ever dare to be
The lady that you are femininity",Femininity
Eric Benét ,"When I'm far away
Could I ever be untrue?

Could I fade away
Find somebody new?

I'll be there for you
Oh baby I'll be waiting around for you
I'll be there for you oh baby I
I'll be there for you

Could a summer breeze
Compare when you're in view?

Could anything or anybody
Thrill me like you do

You'll never be down
That's what it's all about
Can't take me for granted smile
Count my days I'm gone
Together me and you by phone
I promised I'll be gone for a while

When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now

Got to get them straight
How could I ever be late
To the only woman taking up my time
How could I ever allow
I guess I wondered how
I could forget about a pocket of fun

When you know
That you'll never ever do
Number one's gonna be number one

I'll be good
I wish I could
Get the message over to you now

Eric Benét ,"This feels so wrong, I'm so confused
You give me love, but you can't be true
You say you need your space and time
With or without you I'll lose my mind

Oh yes I know if meant to be
In the future we'll be hand in hand
But girl right now you're killing me
'Cause I know you're making love to another man

[Chorus:]
Do you really want to be just friends
Don't you s'til love me
It's so hard for me to understand
You say you love me

You call me for some time to spend
Just long as I'm out your door by 10:00pm
Platonic love will have to suffice
Can't bear the thought of you out of my life

I've tried to end this misery
But I'm always picking up that phone
Swallow my pride, I beg and plead
But you always sing the same ole song, ""We can be friends""

Eric Benét ,"Girl it's true
I can't deny
I've been around a couple of times
So you're afraid
This love in me
Tomorrow we'll no longer be
My heart beats stronger
At the end of each day
Can you feel the rhythm between the two of us
I'd be a fool to turn away
Baby all I'm trying to say is

[Chorus:]
You're so much more than just a girlfriend
You're more than just a temporary love of mine
You're so much more than just a girlfriend
So I'll ask you forever be mine

'Cause when I'm making love to you
I can tell it's not pretend
Many things to me are you
Not just another lady friend
See every brother has a place in his heart
Only one lady can find her way to it
Only one girl
To see your smile is all I need
To know that you're my destiny

[Chorus:]

So I'll stay for always 'til the end of time
Much more than loves before
Don't want to let you go
Right here is where I'll stay
Don't you ever go away

[Chorus:]",More Than Just a Girlfriend
Eric Benét ,"What if I made some time to listen to you
What if you made some time to hear me too
What if we took the time to realize
Givin' some love is givin' compromise
What if I could show you that my love is true
Without all these changes we be going through
What if we learned to play it by the rules

[Chorus:]
What if we was cool...cool
Wasn't acting like fools...fools
What if we was cool...cool
Wouldn't that be cool

What if we tried something not tried before
What if we let love open up the door
What if we set some goals, but not too high
What if we both agreed to really try
What if we knew that we could disagree
But s'til made love the first priority
Show me love like you're suppose to do

Chorus
Do you hear me baby
'Cause our love is fading
Can I get the message through to you
I'm someone to love

What if we had equality for all men
What if we forgot all our forefather sins
What if you forgot the color of my skin
What if you could wear the skin I'm in

What if we knew that we could disagree
But still make love the first priority
Show me love like you're suppose to do

'Cause our love is fading
Can I get a message through to you

I can see what was suppose to be
Now it's all so clear
Love from you was so real, so true, genuine
Stronger than time

[Chorus:]
Wipe your tears away
Kiss you every morning
Hear every word you had to say
Are all the things I should have done
While you were here
And now the foolish boy has grown
Into this man I'm sorry you've never known
I'm not afraid to love
'Cause every beat of my heart
Echoes all those memories from way back when
And the man I should have been

[Chorus:]

Faded dreams of you and me
And of our little family
Gone forever
My god in heaven
Before the gift of clarity
We pay the price of misery
Why please tell me why

But in her eyes I see you more each day
How can I repay
All your love unreturned
From so long, long ago
Now I know

I'll wipe her tears away
Kiss her every morning
Hear every word she has to say

Would do if you were here

Say I love you each and every day
Do all the things that you
Would do if you were here

Eric Benét ,"Here in my mind
Replaying every line
Remembering all of the love we made
You told me only yesterday
Nothing could take your love away

Here in this room so many traces of you
So many nights lying by your side
Sleeping with secrets deep inside
Secrets your eyes could not deny

Come as you are
Lay with me
Beautiful lies once more tell me
With all the love in my heart
I'll set you free
Now that your eyes have said good-bye

I found joy so pure
My heart secure
With the love the two of us would share
And though it all seems so unfair
No one's to blame when love's not there
My whole life has changed
Feels like I'll surely go insane
'Cause my world revolved 'round
a love that never was
Before I say good-bye to love
Just hold me until the morning comes

Come as you are stay with me
Kiss me once more before you leave
With all the pain in my heart
I'll set you free
Now that your eyes have said good-bye

Well I know it's not easy
Finding words to let me know
But the pain of make believing
is much more than just letting go

Come as you are
Lay with me
Beautiful lies once more tell me
With all the love in my heart
I'll set you free
Now that your eyes have said good-bye

Now I got ladies talking to me
But they ain't got shit to say
It's like I've come this far just to miss simpler days
I need to feel her tonight
Deeper love with honesty
I've seen a million girls
But there's just one kind for me

A ghetto girlI like her 'cause she keeps it real
A ghetto girlshe lets me know just how she feels
There's only one girl for me

She won't never leave me guessing
Always let me know the deal
You know that ghetto love is always on the real
She got inner city struggles
And her blood runs deep in me
So when we make love we feel mad history
Well I'm not trying to put nobody down

But I can feel so vivid still the love I felt for her

Soon she'll have to say good-bye
Somewhere there's a heartbeat of the love of my own
Everyday my heart beats with a prayer to find her

Same games it's up and down
Can't wait till I've finally found
A love of my own
Take time to play the field
Take a chance, spin the wheel
Till I find something real
A love of my own

Flash back to the memory,
because the picture's so clear
The love high is so divine, there's nothing better
Heaven is so far away, but she'll bring it right here
And I believe that she can see my
face in her fantasy

No one here beside me she had to go
So I'll start my search again

And I stare at your photo

Candlelight, dinner and wine
You're the rib that's in my spine
But you would not make no time

So your girlfriend came around
All those times that you left town
Made me feel just like a king
When she sat down on my crown

And it shoots like a 380

It felt like we were in grade school
But all those days are through

All those thoughts of going to the chapel
It's like someone just burned my castle
Paint the picture like Picasso
But the image fades
Now for some it might sound deep
But I just received a beep
So I called back anxiously
She put her lover on the line

If you're wondering when you're calling
Why I ain't calling you back
She said I'm loving a new man (she said to me)
If you're wondering when you're calling
Why I ain't calling you back
She said I'm lovin' a new man

And I never knew such a love could be inside of one
And I never knew what my life was for

I never knew til I looked in your eyes (oh baby)
I was incomplete til the day you walked into my life (um, hm)
And I never knew that my heart could feel so precious and pure
One love so real, real

Can I just see you every morning when (every morning, babe)
I open my eyes
Can I just feel your heart beating beside me every night (every day)
Can we just feel this way together til the end of all time
(Can I just spend my life) Can I just spend my life with you (um, hm)

Now baby the days and the weeks and the years will roll by
But nothing will change the love inside of you and I

And baby I'll never find any words that could explain
Just how much my heart, my life, my soul you've changed

Can you run to these open arms when no one else understands
Can we tell God and the whole world I'm your woman and you're my man
Can you just feel how much I love you with one touch of my hand
Can I just spend my life with you

No touch has ever felt so wonderful (you are incredible)

Not a deeper love I've ever known (never let you go)

I swear this love is true (now and forever to you, to you, oh, oh)

Can I just see you every morning when I open my eyes
Can I just feel your heart beating beside me every night
Can we just feel this way together til the end of all time

Can you run to these open arms when no one else understands
Can we tell God and the whole world

Now did I hear you say again,

All I had was love to bring, 
But you was on some ol' material thing
Looks like you're still trying to drive them mad, 
But it's not easy when you're credits bad
I didn't know that I could feel so blue, 
It took some time but girl I'm over you
Would've gladly gave my life for you, 
You should have thought the whole thing through
All those nights with your girlfriends, 
Was just a front for you and him

Y'all was supposed to leave for Honolulu, 
Leaving yo' ass was 'bout the best he could do
Dry your tears now baby it's O.K., 
I'll introduce you to my fiancee
Now tell me baby say again, you been thinking of me?

[Chorus]

Do you think of me in waves that pull you under
From my memory is there nowhere you can hide
Do you close your eyes, see my face and wonder
How could a love so strong be nothing but a lies

[Chorus]",When You Think of Me
Eric Benét ,"Oh
Hey hey
Hey
La la la
He, friend for all my life
I would not deny
Like brothers in my mind. She, treasure of his heart
There upon his arm
Eyes of midnight stars
I've been tempted by forbidden love before
But why must she be everythin
That I've been praying for
Now this burning in my heart will I ignore
When I know that she'll be knocking at my door

[Chorus]
Hey
Why you messing with my feelings
Why you follow me
I can read the signs you're giving
Why you follow me
Turn away from your desire
Why you follow me

Don't be playing with this fire
Why you follow me
Now she's dancing in the night
Her body is the moonlight
Too much for me to fight
Now I'm lost within her arms

Careless with my heart
I'm weakened by her charms
He has looked me in my eyes a million times
But now I turn away for I'm afraid
Of what he'll find
She's the precious love
for whom his heart beats for
But now she's always knocking at my door

[Chorus]",Why You Follow Me
Eric Benét ,"I've been away too long awhile
I lost my rhythm, I forgot my style
Too complicated for this simple man
But now I understand
Like a circle peg in a square hole
I tried to push it but it wouldn't go
It didn't kill me so my strength increased
And now I finally see

I found a love that was gone deep inside of me
I found a man who was lost and I set him free
I thought that the pain was never gonna end
But now I can be myself again

I had the best the world could offer for sho'
But peace of mind is much more precious than gold
I was in place where truth was hard to find
But it's all revealed in time
Stick out my chest and hold my head up high
Forgot how it felt to feel so good inside
A fool would gain the world just to lose himself
Now I'm gonna be true to no one else

I gotta light in my eyes for the world to see
Thank God the music's back inside of me
It was a long hard road to be a better man
But now I can be myself again
I feel the roll of thunder in my bones
I hold my head up high everywhere that I go
And the gift of life I truly understand
'Cause I can be myself again

No there ain't no wound that love can't heal for sho'
And if you lose yourself the Lord will guide you home
This I know
Well I found a joy and serenity
Won't let nobody tell me something's wrong with me
Gotta big love inside and I'm 'mo set it free
And be myself again

I found a love that was gone deep inside of me
I found a man who was lost and I set him free
I thought that the pain was never gonna end
But now I can be myself again
I feel the roll of thunder in my bones
I hold my head up high everywhere that I go

And I can be myself again
I said I can be myself again
I know I can be myself again
I can be myself again",Be Myself Again
Eric Benét ,"Maybe we need just a little more time
Time that can heal what's been on your mind
You can find what we lost before it all slips away
We need time to mend from the mistakes I've made
God only knows what a heart can survive
So many tears from all the pain in our lives
And where else could we go after all we've been through
I still believe my life is right here with you

So just hold on
And it'll wont take long
I hope that you can love me
When the pain is gone
I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart
Don't want us to fall through the cracks of your broken heart

I know its taking a while but every lesson, i've learned
And if your heart speaks tonight, I'll hear every word
If you want to be free I'll never stand in your way
But with all that I am, I'm asking you to stay

Hold on
And it'll wont take long
I hope that you can love me
When the pain is gone
I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart
Don't want us to fall through the cracks of your broken heart

There's a light that can burn
It exists in the heart
You can feel it when you know love is true
If you could try to be strong
And keep the light burning long
It took a lifetime but i found it in you

Hold on
And it'll wont take long
I hope that you can love me
When the pain is gone

Don't want us to fall through the cracks of your broken heart",Cracks of My Broken Heart
Eric Benét ,"Standing here in disarray comes serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide, gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun

Surrounded by everything I want, but nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdities, losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need to find that road
Right around that curve, a lesson learned...
Now that I have the eyes to see

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane....a hurricane
It's sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

With poise and toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treasure is
'Cause they only blocked my view

Spiraling down but so oblivious, got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone?

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane....a hurricane
It's sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

Sometimes I'd cry, but tears wouldn't fall
And sometimes I'd try to break those walls and feel your love
But I came alive inside when I finally found my way

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane....a hurricane
Sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane...",Hurricane

Strugglin' with the woes of life
Just broken down as the rain kept steady pourin'
We questioned and we philosophized
But the only truth that we surmised
Is rain will fall so the rose will keep on growing

By the hands and words her husband used
Till the day would come when she could take no more
With two little girls she was left to feed

I know that life has a funny way of bringing out the best 
By bringing on the pain

I didn't know how to give my love at all.
The next time I settled for what felt so close.
But without romance, you're never gonna fall.
After everything I've learned;
Now it's finally my turn.
This is the last time I'll fall, in love.

The first time we walked under that starry sky,
There was a moment when everything was clear.
I didn't need to ask or even wonder why,
Because each question is answered when your near.
And I'm wise enough to know when a miracle unfolds,
This is the last time I'll fall in love.

Now don't hold back, just let me know.
Could I be moving much too fast or way too slow.
'Cause all of my life, I've waited for this day.
To find that once in a lifetime, this is it, I'll never be the same.

You'll never know what it's taken me to say these words.
And now that I've said them, they could never be enough.

Now the heat of love feels like it's starting to cool
I hear the bells, but they don't ring the way they used to
It's like breaking up is our next obvious move
But let's not move too soon, oh, no

See, the problem going 'round too often these days
People throwing in the towel once they pass the honeymoon phase
A stronger love awaits if we endure this pain
Or else we've been these years, cried these tears in vain (I'm saying)

[Chorus]
Don't let go (That's all I'm saying)
Don't let go (Ooh, girl let's stop playing)
Don't let go (Think of all the love we've been making)
Don't let go (Don't let it go)

[Verse 2]
I've worked your patience, girl and you've been working my nerves
We scream at each other, but we're not hearing one word
We've made mistakes that neither one of us deserves
Leaving much desired where I was concerned

I saw an old man and his wife early today
They were holding hands, his eyes locked in her gaze
Think of all the times they came so close to parting ways
In my mind, I could hear him say, ""Stay, babe.""

Don't you let go
When another woman jumps in my face
I will not let go
When the honeymoon starts fading away
I won't let go
If we're gonna make it I want to hear you say
I swear I won't let go.

Its amazing and I'm loving that you're
Still wanting me, you're still hungry
You keep rising like you're never gonna reach the top
I'm not tryin' to make you stop
Because you're still wanting me, still hungry

Now the first time was amazing like I said.
Like nothing I've seen, done or read
Colors and music played in my head
I wasn't prepared

Now the next time happen when I finally caught my breath
I saw the sweat drip off your chest.
Girl you inspire my very best
And I gave nothing less

And it seems
With every conversation in between
I get a little more attracted
When you open up your mind girl I find
Your perception of the world coincides with mine.

And I tried to let the fever in me subside
But every time I see that little look in your eye
I come back to life
And I rise, I rise, I rise, oh

From the bedroom to the kitchen, up against the wall
Still I hear your body call because
You're still wanting me, and you're still hungry

From 100 miles an hour back to slow motion
I'm the waves up on your ocean
Cause your still wanting me, and you're still hungry

Did you know that you smile when you're asleep?
Is it there all the time
Or only when you're with me?
When the morning sun shines on your face
Let me be the first breath you take.

[Chorus: Repeats]",The Hunger
Eric Benét ,"I believe in the power inside of my heart
God is the source from whom we're never apart
No challenge too great and no cause too small
This infinite love is inside of us all

[Verse 1]
My buddy, Greg lost his leg serving time in the desert
Sitting drinking, thinking of things he couldn't do no more
Took a while for Greg to smile, but I heard he's doing better
He just won a marathon, second year in a row

Oh, there's a storm that you're gone have to ride in your life
Hope is the beacon that saves when you're lost in your life
Just hold on and you'll go with the tide

[Chorus]
Love, patience, and time
And it won't take long, till it's gonna be alright
Love, patience, and time
That power is strong in your heart and mine

[Verse 2:]
I knew a girl, a pretty girl, but her daddy never loved her
She wondered why every guy left her out in the cold
What Daddy did she must forgive, before her heart grows colder
And all the love she's dreaming of, maybe then she will know
Yeah, we've got stories and people to blame for our lives
No, don't get lost in that circle
Don't you know that's a lie, the only way is to leave the past behind

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge]
There's so much more inside you and me
That the world needs to still believe
Nothing's too great for this God and me
Keep in mind love and life
Everything is gonna be alright

[Verse 3:]
Grab a gun, everyone, said the leader of many
We've got to kill to change the will of the other side
Some people swear that blood and fear will bring the world together
I believe that all we need love, patience, and time.

[Chorus]",Love Patience & Time
Eric Benét ,"Last night I dreamed my life was over and done
The angels threw me high above
They called it Heaven, but I know it was a lie
For when I looked, you weren't inside

[Chorus 1]
If I had only one more tomorrow
I'd spend that day with you
I'd feel no more pain or sorrow there with you

[Verse 2]
Last night my dream revealed the day could soon come
Without your kiss, your touch, your love
The first tears of Heaven cried would be mine
Till you were there right by my side

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
If I had only one more tomorrow
Imagine if you could
I'd spend my final hours, yes I would

Sometimes life makes us feel so secure
Like our days will last forever
Time will come when I'll be no more
Just think of me and remember

Eric Benét ,"Can I tell you, shall I count the ways?
Can I find the words that could explain?
How my heart, my life, my soul, you changed forever

You ease my pain with such gentle hand
And when I'm with you I'm a better man
And I'll never ever understand the way

'Cause you sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
And when I look into your eyes I hear a song that never dies
'Cause you sing to me

There's so much evil in the world today
Everybody's trying to make their way
Looking for a piece of love to make it better

But we can make it through and rise above
With your letter serenade of love
And I know that we'll be strong enough to go on and on and on

'Cause you sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
Sweet enough to make me cry 'cause it keeps our love alive
Oh you sing to me, oh won't you sing baby?

And even through the fire
I know our love will find a way
And you're the reason why girl
I'm singing stronger everyday

You sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
'Cause when I look into your eyes I hear a song that never dies
'Cause you sing to me, oh sing baby

You sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
Sweet enough to make me cry 'cause it keeps our love alive
When you sing to me

You sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
'Cause when I look into your eyes I hear a song that never dies
'Cause you sing to me

You sing to me, sing to me
Please baby sing to me
Sing to me, sing to me

Eric Benét ,"I'm going back to the day we parted
And all the ways you were broken hearted
Take a trip everyday in my mind

I see your face I recall it few word
Its playing back like a broken record
I remember every tear in your eye

(If I do what I know)
I'd walk back in time
(I will write every wrong)
Oh, I would change every line
(and you'll be here right now)
Just like yesterday
(But you'd feel no more doubts)
When you hear me say

You're the only one I want (you're the only one, yeah)
You're the only one I need in my life (in my life, baby)
You're the only one I love (I love, love, love)
You're the only one I need in my life

I see the world through a haze of memories
And then the girls don't mean a damn thing to me
It's kinda sad how they just don't compare
(Time will tell, let's wait and see)
(If our love we had was meant to be)
Cause I know we got a future out there

(Cause you're still my girl)
I don't care what they say
(Let's go back to our world)
Baby don't you throw this love away
(Cause I still believe)
In the magic of us

Now love ain't easy sometimes
But if you find it we'll stay together

Eric Benét ,"What's the use of trying?
It never seems to work
The love just doesn't love you
Is the lesson you've learned.
You've mended broken pieces,
At least dozen times,
To take another chance now,
You see no reason why.

[Chorus]
But there's always a reason for falling in love,
And it's always the darkest, before your light comes
Like the winter believes in the promise of a sun,
I guess there's always a reason for falling in love.

I'm praying your existence, and something that will pass,
Like when you said our first kiss, will surely be our last.
Girl, I understand you,
More than you believe,
Like you my heart was broken,
But you helped me to see

[Chorus]

Is a lifetime of tears we can both leave behind?
Cause in so many ways we've been broken inside.
All the questions you ask, we'll find answers together in time.
All we need is to believe that

And all is perfect in my lonely world again.
As we lay we make a plan for life together,

And our children seem to grow each year much faster,
We're alone now in this emptiness and love still grows,
But only visions of a life that should have been.

Wherever we are just hold me

So I never wanna live without you baby (I'll never live without you babe)
Never gonna live to doubt you (never live to doubt your love)

Never wanna live without the biggest part of my life
Wanna build my world around you baby (wanna build my world)

Summer lovin, I remember falling once upon my history
Sun was shinin, you were in a hurry but nowhere that ya had to be
Some conversation for a while until we felt the magic grow (ooohh)
Thats when my summer came alive but seasons come and seasons go (ooohh)
Tender kisses underneath the moonlight softly on your brown skin
Makin wishes, plans to spend our whole life knowing that this time would end
And like the temperature outside our feelings and emotions rose
I dreamed id take you as my bride but soon the autumn winds would blow (ooowoo)

My summer love (oooohooohoooo)
I'm searchin for you (ooohooohoo)
Our time was only for a season 
My heart remains true (mmm yeah)

I remember walkin on the boardwalk beaming from just holdin hands
We were runnin in between the raindrops, innocence that couldn't last
I close my eyes when I'm alone and travel back to way back then (yes I do)
And like no other lover known, you make me feel alive again

My summer love (ooohooohooo)
I'm searchin for you (ooohoohoo)
Our time was only for a season
My heart remains true 
My summer love (ooohooohoo)
I'm lost without you (ooohoohoo)
So many years have past between us
I'm still your love fool

Take me away from this life
To places where you end up mine
Can we go back to the best time of our lives

Eric Bogle,"Now when I was a young man, I carried me pack
And I lived the free life of the rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback
Well, I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in 1915, my country said ""son
It's time you stopped rambling, there's work to be done""
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun
And they marched me away to the war

And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As the ship pulled away from the quay
And amidst all the cheers, the flag-waving and tears
We sailed off for Gallipoli

And how well I remember that terrible day
How our blood stained the sand and the water
And of how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
Johnny Turk, he was waiting, he'd primed himself well
He showered us with bullets and he rained us with shell
And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia

But the band played Waltzing Matilda
When we stopped to bury our slain
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs
Then we started all over again

And those that were left, well we tried to survive
In that mad world of blood, death and fire
And for ten weary weeks, I kept myself alive
Though around me the corpses piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head
And when I woke up in me hospital bed
And saw what it had done, well I wished I was dead
Never knew there was worse things than dyin'

For I'll go no more waltzing Matilda
All around the green bush far and free
To hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs
No more waltzing Matilda for me

So they gathered the crippled, the wounded, the maimed
And they shipped us back home to Australia
The legless, the armless, the blind, the insane
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me
To grieve, to mourn, and to pity

As they carried us down the gangway
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared
Then they turned all their faces away

And so now every April, I sit on me porch
And I watch the parades pass before me
And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march
Reviving old dreams of past glories
And the old men march slowly, old bones stiff and sore
They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war
And the young people ask, ""what are they marching for?""
And I ask myself the same question

But the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call
But as year follows year, more old men disappear
Someday no one will march there at all

Eric Bogle,"""NOW I'M EASY""
- Eric Bogle

For nearly sixty years, I've been a Cockie
Of droughts and fires and floods I've lived through plenty
This country's dust and mud have seen my tears and blood
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

I married a fine girl when I was twenty
But she died in giving birth when she was thirty
No flying doctor then, just a gentle old black 'gin
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

She left me with two sons and a daughter
On a bone-dry farm whose soil cried out for water
So my care was rough and ready, but they grew up fine and steady
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

My daughter married young, and went her own way
My sons lie buried by the Burma Railway
So on this land I've made me home, I've carried on alone
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

City folks these days despise the Cockie
Say with subsidies and dole, we've had it easy
But there's no drought or starving stock on a sewered suburban block
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

For nearly sixty years, I've been a Cockie
Of droughts and fires and floods, I've lived through plenty
This country's dust and mud, have seen my tears and blood
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
And now I'm easy

Cockie: Australian small-scale family farmer

",Now I'm Easy
Eric Bogle,"Now when I was a young man, I carried me pack
And I lived the free life of the rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback
Well, I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in 1915, my country said ""son
It's time you stopped rambling, there's work to be done""
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun
And they marched me away to the war

And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As the ship pulled away from the quay
And amidst all the cheers, the flag-waving and tears
We sailed off for Gallipoli

And how well I remember that terrible day
How our blood stained the sand and the water
And of how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
Johnny Turk, he was waiting, he'd primed himself well
He showered us with bullets and he rained us with shell
And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia

But the band played Waltzing Matilda
When we stopped to bury our slain
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs

Eric Bogle,"""SOMETHING OF VALUE""
-Eric Bogle

I can see the Southern Cross tonight
While here below, bathed in it's light
The Dreamtime land safe, snug and tight is sleeping
Wrapped in complacency and contentedness
No discordant sounds disturb our rest
While the gentle souls we've dispossesed are weeping

We took it all by the gun and the sword
By the right of our race and in the name of our God
Though as outcasts ourselves, transported, condemned
None knew better than we the injustice of men

We took it all in our hunger and need
Enslaved by our past and consumed by our greed
And left them to beg for the scraps at our door
While we called them drunkards and wasters and whores
They've been drowning, drowning in their tears
For the last two hundread years

From England's New Jerusalem
To the Dreamtime land the tall ships came
With human cattle in convict chains to bind them
In the grim fight just to stay alive
Dreams must struggle to survive
Few could see the glitt'ring prize before them

We had it all in the palm of our hand
A new hope, a new dream, a new life, a new land
One last chance to break from the chains of the past
To build something of value, build something to last

This ancient land was a vast empty page
Waiting for the great writers of a brand new age
The future was ours to protect or profane
A paradise lost, a paradise gained
Now tell me, is paradise here,
After two hundred years?

So now, beneath the Southern Cross
It's time to tally up the cost
Of what we've gained and what we've lost forever
Though much has gone we can't replace
Those of us who love this place
Together now, must turn and face the future

So here's to us all, we're frail humankind
Who wander through life mostly helpless and blind
To our courage and cowardice, our humor and pain
Our hundred steps forward, ninety-nine back again

Yes here's to us all, the wise and the fools
The indifferent, the caring, the kind and the cruel
As we march to the beat of an uncertain drum
Stumbling towards what we may yet become
Towards the brave new frontiers,
Of the next two hundred years

Children are born with trust in their eyes
It's the first thing that we betray
Children are born believing in magic
It's the first thing we take away
Fill them with doubt instead of magic
And fear instead of trust
And after awhile, they're just like us

On this earth there is a city
In a rich green pleasant country
Where they kill their children
The children of the streets
Free enterprise extermination
Why waste rehabilitation?
A bullet is forever
It's so final quick and cheap

And the despots all wear policemen's badges
Kill to supplement their wages
Earn their bloody bounty
With the gun and the club and knife
While profit-conscious businessmen
Upright solid citizens
Pay them a cew cruzeiros
For every murdered street kids life

(But they're children!)
They're garbage on the streets
(Oh the children!)
They're beggars, whores and thieves
(Oh pity the children!)
Cry pity if you will,
There's none on the streets
Of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil

To bless this piece of paradise
High on a hill stands Jesus Christ
Gazing down with sightless eyes
At the daily blasphemy
A mocking marble coontradiction
Arms spread wide in benediction
Suffer the little children,
Suffer them to come to me

And the despots cry ""amen, amen""
While they bow their knees to Bethlehem
They spit in the face of humankind
Turn our dreams to worthless dust
And the future, as it's always done,
Stares down the barrel of a gun
Which once more begs the question,
When will the despots come for us?

(But they're children!)
Have you seen their eyes?
(Oh the children!)
Hard and wary and street-wise
(Oh pity the children!)
There are no children here
Only old eyes full of hunger
And hate and hopeless fear

(But they're children!)
Abandoned and forsaken
(Oh the children!)
Useless human flotsam
(Oh pity the children!)
And pity us as well
For in our children's' eyes
We see mirrors of ourselves

",Mirrors

There's really nothing more to say

Just close the door and walk away

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you
No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

The summer made it seem so right

He's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
There's plastic shamrocks everywhere, there's Guinness and green beer
And a sign in gaelic above the bar which says ""God Bless All Here""

His guitar sounds like a wardrobe, and it's out of tune at that
His singin' voice it ranges from a sharp to a flat
He's just desecrated ""The Holy Ground"", ripped apart ""Black Velvet Band""
Sang some nights drunk and now he's sunk ""The Irish Rover"" with all hands

'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
The publican's a proddy Scot by the name of McIntyre
Who does not allow collections for the men behind the wire

He's done awful things to ""Molly Malone"" and ""The Farrows of Tralee""
He's murdered ""Carach Fergus"" and poor old ""Mother Machree""
He's just thrashed his way through ""Galway Bay"" and ""The Wild Irish Rose""
And if he starts singing ""Danny Boy"", I'm gonna punch him in the nose!

He's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
There's Aer Lingus posters everywhere showing pretty Irish scenes
All peaceful and idyllic, and very bloody green!

""When Irish Eyes are Smiling"" and ""The Mountains of Mourne""
In a central Celtic chiché, the man has left no stone unturned
'Til he embarks upon the harp that once through terraced halls
Accompanying himself on the Bodhrán, which takes a lot of courage

'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
Now he's just sung in his mother tongue, ""The Ancient Irish Curse""
And cleared the pub completely by the forty-second verse!

'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
He's started singin' ""Danny Boy"", so it's time that I was gone
And just one thought comes to my mind, as I stagger through the door
Where are you when we need you, Christy Moore?
Where are you when we need you, Christy Moore?

Eric Bogle,"""Welcome Home""
-Eric Bogle

Now when the boys came home, Annie cried and Annie cheered
She'd been on her own for a long and lonely year
Living for his letters from far away Vietnam
And dreading the official telegram

So she was waiting at the station when his train came rolling in
She ached with anticipation of holding him again
And suddenly he was standing there in his crumpled uniform
In a heartbeat she was in his arms

Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
Did you wonder, over there,
When you were tired, when you were scared,
If your country really cared, welcome home

When a nation goes to war, everyone's a casualty
Some are maimed and scarred, most have wounds you cannot see
So in place of the man that she had known,
Annie found instead, a sick and troubled stranger in her bed

But she was stubborn, she was lovin', so she stayed all through the years
The hard times and the drinking, the nightmares and the tears
For where hate is muddy quicksand, love is tempered steel
Annie waited for his wounds to heal

Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
We're just so glad that you're alive
And only you will wonder why
You lived when others died, welcome home

So on a sunny Sydney morning, I heard old war drums beat
And watched the boys come marching, down the city street*
To claim their place in the nation's heart
That their blood and pain had earned
A nation that rejoiced in their return

And if the day helped to heal some wounds is a matter of debate
For some it had come none too soon, for others far too late
But I found myself hoping, as the boys went marching past
That for them the war was over, at last

Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
What you went through in Vietnam, we can't begin to understand
But to each and every man, welcome home

Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
May the years bring you release, as the memories decrease
May you find some kind of peace, welcome home
May you find some kind of peace, welcome home

Eric Bogle,"I'm pleased to meet you, my name's Dan
And I'm an honest working man
A tarnished badge, they tell me
But it's one I wear with pride
A fair day's work for a fair day's pay
I've always lived my life that way
But now I can't help thinking
I've been taken for a ride

Those hard years on the factory floor
Toilin' in the ceaseless roar
That made me old before my time
Wrecked my hearing and my health
And when I total up the cost
What I've gained to what I've lost
I ask myself now Dan
What's the total of your wealth?
Just how much is your life worth?

I live in a house I'll never own
Could never get a housing loan
Bank managers and suchlike
Don't rate the likes of me
Feeding three kids on a fitter's wage
I've always found it hard to save
And being an honest working man
Don't count as equity

All those years of toil and sweat
Climbing in and out of debt
I often look back on them
And ask myself for what?
A rented house on a grimy street
An endless fight to make ends meet
When you add it all together
It don't seem like a lot
But it's all that I've got

But a man's life can't be judged alone
By what he has or what he owns
It's what he loves and cares for
That gives it quality
And what gives meaning to my life
Are my three kids and my wife
We've always stuck together
Always being a famil

Now my kids are rotting on the dole
Holding out the beggar's bowl
I see the anger in their eyes
It cuts me to the heart
And shall I simply stand aside
While my kids are slowly crucified?
Watch all I've worked and cared for
As it slowly falls apart
Well by Christ, I won't do that

I'm pleased to meet you, my name's Dan
And I'm an honest working man
A tarnished badge, they tell me
But it's one I wear with pride
A fair day's work for a fair day's pay
I've always lived my life that way
But now I can't help thinking
I've been taken for a ride

And though I ain't got much to spare
What I have I'm going to share
To give my kids and other kids
Some purpose, pride, and place
And you leeches, grown fat on my sweat
I promise you I won't forget
When I asked you if you'd share the load
You laughed right in my face
Yes, you laughed right in my face

I'm pleased to meet you, my name's Dan
And I'm an honest working man",Dan

(Album: The Colour of Dreams)

Hey Ibrahim, tell me what do you think of Australia?
Do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder?
As the sky catches fire, and the trees and the mountains change colour
But I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better

So Ibrahim, can you tell me, why did you come here?
What dream were you chasing and what did you hope to find here?
Did you flee from your own native land because your life was in danger?
Or were the reasons much more mundane, just poverty and hunger?

Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour

You see Ibrahim, there's something I've been meaning to tell you
Being hungry and poor bestows no special status upon you
We won't send you back, if you can prove they'd imprison or kill you
But if you're just going back home to starve, I'm afraid we can't help you

You see Ibrahim, you've become a bit of a problem
This world's full of refugees fleeing poverty, war and oppression
So to take in queue-jumpers like you, well it's out of the question
It would give the world's hungry and poor the wrong impression

Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour

I'm afraid Ibrahim, it's time to be totally candid
You had Buckley's chance* right from the moment you landed
Already to many a threat and a danger you were branded
And all because you follow the prophet Mohammed

You didn't count Ibrahim, on political opportunism
Our leaders knew that to many Australians, the very word ""Muslim""
Meant Al-Quaeda, Hammas, the Taliban, and terrorism
And that's why you and your family are locked up in prison.

Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour

So Ibrahim, tell me what do you think of Australia?
Do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder?
As the sky catches fire, and the trees and the mountains change colour
But I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better
Yes I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better

He tends the sick
Gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man
But he feels it most for the children
(unclean)

Tears glisten on his cheek
Did man ever deserve this death?
And not all will die, just the poor 
For the rich are inside the castle walls
And he knows he could be with them
And they laugh at this fool of a man 
Through the stone fortress windows
And the bell tolls on
(unclean)

And many deaths and many days later
Many tears have been cry cried but in vain 
For tears can never erase the pain of death
Only time has that talent
His hands are now blistered but this man walks on
The only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all
And the bell tolls on inside the castle wall
(bring out your dead)

The dead are now buried and the plague is at its end
Life for the people flowers again
They breathe fresh air like they did once before
And there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls
The bell has stopped

And only silence is heard
And the peasants outside wonder what happened within
In their bones they feel something is wrong
The bell has been silent much too long
For many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live
No one came and no one went
Fear can do many strange things

And even though water ran low
Their mouths burnt and belly's caked dry
Not one person put a foot outside
No one had that much courage
For they feared the peasants and their world outside
So they played it safe and didn't move
But one by one they perished and died",The Black Plague

Eric Burdon,"And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

As a child I dreamed of her, on the far banks of the river
I knew she could not be reached, for my mind was forever wondering
Far above his head, as he tried his best to teach me
The river was muddy and black, black as the coal she carried
Impossible to cross, many men had tried
The old sailor told me, another life is lost

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

Black was the colour of my childish dreams, impressions that would last
Black coal, coal black pit yacka's face, escaping the coal dust blast
Blind pony stumblin' to the light of day, to retire in the green fields forever
And I'll build me a bridge of steel, to beat the black river forever
I'll beat that black river forever, I'll beat that muddy river forever

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

Geordie: That's true, I havna been too happy but what brought us down here was three years on the docks and I just come down here for work and for money and get a bit few, few more quid in me pocket.

That's the sound of little feet
Running away from home
Little feet are always running away from home
To find bigger feet
And they usually end up getting kicked in the head

I joined the navy at the age of seventeen
There were lots of places I had not been
I had a dream in my head about a little Japanese girl
And it wasn't till I sailed halfway 'round the world
You know, you know
I miss good lookin' women in my home town
You know I miss warm cookin' mama, that you lay down

I found myself
On the 'frisco Bay
Getting high off the wind
A different chick every day
It wasn't till I found
Myself down Mexico way
With tears in my eyes
I was hurt to ?
You know, Lord I said...
I miss good lookin' women in my home town
You know I miss the home cookin' mama, that you lay down

So here I am
A million miles away from home
But I really do believe someday my time will come
Then I'll return the prodigal son
Spend the rest of my days loving every single last one
Yes, I miss good lookin' women in my home town
Yeah, you know I miss good lookin' women, that you lay down
You know I miss the good cookin' mama, that you used to lay down

Eric Burdon,"It's ten o'Clock in the morning
Can't get out of my bed
And I can't get you out of my head
I reach over and touch someone
But it isn't you who is there
Never did like love affairs

Said goodbye to my kid
Said goodbye to my wife
Packed up my bags, put them in my car
And said goodbye to this life
Everybody said I was crazy
How could lever leave you this way
I've been thinking a lot about you girl, today 

I will be with you again
I will be with you again
I will be with you again

Everybody is staring at me
Everybody looks so concerned
I wish they could listen to me
There's a lesson here to be learned
I haven't felt this good for a long time
So won't you please leave me be
Let me swim in the sea of tranquility

I will be with you again
I will be with you again
I will be with you again

Set me free

I wish I could talk through your heart
I wish you could hear what I say
Even though we're miles apart
You're with me every step of the way

I will be with you again

I will be with you one of these days 'Cause
I can't fee I nothin' but love
Thats all I feel
I can feet you, can you feel me?
'Cause your love has set me free",I Will Be With You Again
Eric Burdon,"Tension in the city
Danger in the air
I can hear the footsteps of people running scared
Somebody is watching me
I can feel it in my bones
And now the night is callin' me
Callin' me back home

Run for your life
Run to survive
The streets are alive
So you'd better run for your life

Another broken window
Reflects another fight
Another confrontation is being planned tonight
Look ! I don't wanna be no hero
I just wanna stay alive
Can't we talk this over
'Cause I don't want to fight

Run for your life
Run to survive
The streets are alive
So you'd better run for your life

Keep on runnin, keep on runnin'
'Cause they keep on comin' at you
Hatches, ratches, sticks and stones
They don't ca re if you're young or old
Replicants, handguns, shotguns, and rubber bullets
Then they hit you with the TV-reports of the
Downtrodden
And the oppressed
Meanwhile, you're obsessed
But the fact Is it's you everybody is tat king about

Got to keep on running
Cause the people keep on comin'
And they're comin' after you and me
Got to keep on moving
'Cause the shadows keep on moving
And they're movin' in on you and me
I'm looking for direction and I'm looking for
Protection
And I want to escape the knife
So you'd better run for your life

Eric Burdon,"'There are winds of changes blowing
Gathering leaves up in its path
And the people who are the leaves 
Will remain in our hearts
With love, 'till eternity 
 
King Elmore was born,
So was Duke Ellington
Jelly Roll made love
Bessie Smith was created in heaven above
Robert Johnson sang the blues
Shick Webb did those things that only he could do
Charlie Christian started a new thing
And, oh my, how Billie Holiday could sing
Alan Freed rock and rolled, 
Joe Turner's voice was very low
B.B. King wailed
Charlie Parker cried
Louis Jordan smiled
Ray Charles moaned, 
Chuck Berry rock and rolled
Fats Domino made me feel good
Elvis Presley did things that no one thought he could 
 
Then came the Beatles, Rolling Stones
Whole new thing was going on.
Frank Zappa zapped
Mamas and Papas knew where it was at
They all listened to Ravi Shankar.
Now that we got Jimi Hendrix
We know where we are (and Louis Jordan smiled)
And the winds of change go on blowing, blowing,
Gathering more and more leaves in its path, 
As time goes past
 
Winds of change keep on blowing, 
Winds of change keep on blowing,
Bob Dylan sang about the winds of change

Eric Burdon,"Well, I came back to the city
And it wasn't very pretty,
It was dying

There were some who had more than they could eat
And other with no shoes up on their feet,
They were crying

I saw a brother sell his brother
While the cops held another,
They were laughing

I saw two dogs in the street,
A black one and a white one,
They were fighting
If it isn't very pretty
Why do they stay in the city
And watch it dying?

Why don't I go back to the country
And sit beneath a plum tree with my sweet little girl,
And listen to her singin'?

It's because I'm caught in a trap
Lord, and you know where that's at
It sure ain't the country
Oh, Lord knows, it ain't the country
It's because its the way I see it every night and day
I hope to change it

Eric Burdon,"Read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the

And God I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Eric Burdon,"White houses in neat little rows
Contrasting against the sky
Tumbled down black shacks over the tracks
Children so hungry they could cry

The chrome, the steel, the metal dream
Leaving the teepee to rot
The escapist young mind, left behind
Saving dimes for community pot

You better get straight
Better, better get straight
I feel you better get straight right now
Better get straight, babe

They're crying out for love all the time
But they fail to see the neighbors eyes
The TV is on, 6 o clock news
And channels in full colored lies

The company meets, the president speaks
He's young but his bones creak
Young girl dresses for the high school dance
And the guy next door is dying for a beat

Get straight, you better
Yes, you better get straight, babe
Did you hear what I said?
I said to you, that you, you better get straight

They put a bible in a drawer of the motel room
And it's crying out to be read
But it stays right there, collecting dust
No one understands what's being said

Lovers make love in country boxes
What will tomorrow bring?
They've been told that it's wrong
But they don't give a damn
Soon another life it will bring

You better get straight, babe
Yeah, you better get straight, baby

Until he's been to hell and back
One thing you've got to understand
You can't kill the boogieman

They're placing bets on John but don't listen
I tell everybody as long as you're around
The blues will always be living
Can't kill the boogieman
Can't kill the boogieman
Can't kill the boogieman No

The power of a serpent in his finger
Relax release and let your mind drift away
You've got to be saved

You know what they're talking about John
Your birthday I get to play
I tell everybody as long as you're around

Eric Burdon,"As I went out walking
One fine summer morning
The birds in the bushes
Did whistle and sing
The lads and the lassies
In couples were courting
Going back to the factory
Their work to begin

I spied one among them
She was fairer than most
Her cheeks like the red rose
That blooms in the spring
Her hair like the lily
Thet grows in yon valley
She was only a hard working
Factory Girl

I steps up aside her more closely to feel her
She says my young man
Don't stare me so
She said I've got gold in my pocket
And silver as well
No more will I answer
That factory call

Now the years have all passed
From the days of our youth
Our home is now teeming
With children at play
Life goes on in the village
You can still hear the whistle

And he was already dead inside his dream

Are locked up inside you like pounding fear

I give you my heart, but you wanted my head
And there's nothing, nothing we don't deserve
And contrary to desire, like the reverse of me and you

And leaves us nothing, nothing left to pursue

Now there's a knucklehead, I had it painted red
Standing alone in the yard
We won't be riding together no more girl

Eric Carmen,"Sometimes it's hard to know
What your heart is feelin'
And harder still to put it into words
Love is simple you can't define it
It's not the words but the thought
Behind it that counts

My girl
She's everything a lover could possibly be
My girl
Makes love the way I always dreamed
It would be

Deep down inside I know
What I should be saying
But every time I try, it comes out wrong
Well our love is a love forever
And when we're all alone together
She shows me

My girl
She's everything a lover could possibly be
My girl
Makes love the way I always dreamed
It would be

I'd need a lifetime
To show her all the love I have to give
And hold her in my heart
For as long as I live
(we'll stick together
Like the moon and the night-time
Happy forever I could spend my lifetime)
So in love with

My girl
She's everything a lover could possibly be
My girl
Makes love the way I always dreamed
It would be",My Girl
Eric Carmen,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say

Eric Carmen,"Twenty years with my brain in a book
Tryin' to find out who I am
Endless nights and Olympian dreams
Of a race I never ran
Someone's callin' my name
It's the crowd in the stands
Don't know how I became
What I suddenly am
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
I've been searchin' so long
But the answer is finally at hand
I'm a marathon man
Wind is gone and my head's in a haze
But I must keep up the pace
Got to think about strategy here
If I hope to win the race
Someone's callin' my name
It's the crowd in the stands
Concentrate on the pain
Put my soul in command
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
I've been searchin' so long
But the answer is finally at hand
I'm a marathon man
Wasting my youth
Chasing dreams, testing truth
Taking turns being deceived
And deceivin'
Bound with a rope
Made of heroes and hope
Till I found nothin' left

Eric Carmen,"Lovers come and lovers go
But it's never twice the same
Happiness is hard to show
When you're numb to all the pain
And I've been floatin' round
Like an old newspaper
Blowin' down some windy street
Feelin' so alone and incomplete
(Chorus)
But there's nowhere to hide
Where the night can't find me.
Where the light of the sun can't blind me
Like the light in a woman's eyes
There's nowhere to hide
>From the dream that drives me
Like a fire burning deep inside me
Oh I know she'll be here tonight.
Can the future be foretold
In a faded photograph
Can a dream be bought or sold
Well I guess I have to laugh
Sippin' on a scotch and soda
A shadow in the corner booth
So philosophic and drunk on grown-up truth.
Half-forgotten fragments
Of a high school dance
In the dead white hours of winter
When we loved so hard
That we thought it would never end
Trying to remember
How it used to feel
When a kiss was something special
And I wonder now
Will it ever be again

Eric Carmen,"She was just an average blue-eyed
Golden high school dream
An illusion nothing real could ever touch
Funny love seemed so much more intense
At seventeen
When I knew she'd never love me
Half as much

I recall the desperate vow I made
I must find a way somehow to win her heart
I've got to make her mine

Gonna run away
Till I prove that I'm a man
Gonna run away
Be the best I know I can
Got to run away
Got to find my space and time
And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine

Trades were made for promises
Of a timeless memory
And I knew but still refused to comprehend
The fantasy more glamorous
Then she could ever be
Was the course of least resistance
In the end

I recall the desperate vow I made
I must find a way somehow to win her heart
I've got to make her mine

Gonna run away
Till I prove that I'm a man
Gonna run away
Be the best I know I can
Got to run away
Got to find my space and time
And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine

Long ago an innocence
Lived deep within my soul
In a yesterday where love
And dreams remain
But disillusion clouds my eyes
And the winter takes it's toll
For the spring has gone
And will not come again

I recall the desperate vow I made
I must find a way somehow to win her heart
I've got to make her mine

Gonna run away
Till I prove that I'm a man
Gonna run away
Be the best I know I can
Got to run away
Got to find my space and time
And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine

And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine",Run Away

And in the bank of my love

Don't you put me to the test

Every red-blooded boy

With one great voice
They want to jump
They want to turn up the noise

And of stompin' their feet

Like Kansas wheat
She can move
Like a New York street
And she can kiss
She can kiss so sweet

We got red, hot schemes

I was wondering how my friends have changed
I was thinking bought a certain girl
I was hoping to find there
I walked in and she caught my eye
Though she was standing with another guy
All the years seemed to fade away
Could it be she still remembered

She remembered
It was so long ago
Could we ever feel that way again
She remembered
Making love 'neath the stars
Oh, the world was so much younger then
When we kissed and my heart stood still
I said I loved her and I always will
'Cause dreams are forever
And some things you never forget

She introduced me to the guy she was with
Then I asked her if she'd like to dance
We hit the floor as the band began
Our favorite old slow song
I pulled her close and to my surprise
I heard her whisper as she closed her eyes,
""God it's just like it used to be
I wasn't sure if you'd remember""

I remember
It was so long ago
Could we ever feel that way again

But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure",All by Myself

But perfection is consuming
And it seems we're only human after all
And we've both been takin' the fall

Maybe we're colder
So we disregard solutions
While we cling to our illusions once again
And we keep rememberin' when
Seasons are changin'
Reasons are changin'
But the story isn't ending
So we find ourselves pretending one more day
While the years keep slippin' away

[Chorus]",Boats Against the Current
Eric Carmen,"I can still recall
When we said that our love was forever
All those plans we made
For tomorrow that looked so bright
And I understand
All the reasons you gave me for leavin'
But that doesn't help
When I'm sleepin' alone each night

So if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do

I could find someone
More than willing to be your replacement
But there's no one else
Who can move me the way you do
So for now, goodbye
But if ever you find you still want me
You just call my name
'Cause I'll always be here for you

So if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do

Nothing you could ever do
Would change the things I know
Deep in my heart
So I got to make you understand before I go
Sooner or later
I don't know when
I'm gonna get you back
In my arms again

And if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do

And if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do

And if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do",Change of Heart
Eric Carmen,"Hey, Deanie
Won't you come out tonight?
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love
 
Hey, Deanie
Won't you come out tonight?
The summer's waitin'
The moon is shinin' so bright
Hey, Deanie, you're the one
I'm dreamin' of
 
I was a fool for your love
From the moment I saw you
Like a vision in the darkness
Of a thousand lonesome, lonely nights
Like my heart threw away the key
I'm as blind as a man could be
Oh, darlin'
Till you help me see the light
 
Hey, Deanie
Won't you come out tonight?
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love
 
Hey, Deanie
Won't you come out tonight?
The summer's waitin'
The moon is shinin' so bright
Hey, Deanie, you're the one
I'm dreamin' of
 
I stand accused
I'm in league with the forces of darkness
An incurable believer
In the magic of the midnight sky
And the love that I found today
Oh, I can't let it slip away
Oh, darlin', can't you read between the lines?
 
Hey, Deanie
Won't you come out tonight?
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love
 
Hey, Deanie
Won't you come out tonight?
The summer's waitin'
The moon is shinin' so bright
Hey, Deanie, you're the one
I'm dreamin' of
 
Deanie, love is all there is
I don't want to lose it
Don't want to let the evenin' go
If it's here within our reach
I think we should use it
Now while we're young enough
To still let it show
 
Hey, Deanie
Won't you come out tonight?
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love
 
Hey, Deanie

You're the one I'm dreamin' of

You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
I'm a fool for your love
Won't you come out?
Come out tonight",Hey Deanie
Eric Carmen,"I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin' that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine and tonight

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise

I feel the magic between you and I

I want to hold you so hear me out
I want to show you what love's all about

With these hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be

One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
