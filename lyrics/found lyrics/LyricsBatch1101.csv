Fast car, fast car
I wanna meet your fast car
Take me on a comet ride,
Shoot me past the fast car
I wish I owned that last car
You could be the end to
Everything my hearts asking for.

Take me away
(So, so, far away)
I don't wanna feel no sorrow
Take me away
(So, so, far away)
I might not see tomorrow.

(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
You tell me you can cure my addiction (addiction)
And you tear my feet off the ground
Every time I would forget my affliction (affliction)
But I don't want to come down

It's just the high that your givin' me (givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me (givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground.

Take me up in your rocket ship
Take me so so far away. (away)
Let me forget all the good shit
Take me so, so far away (away)

I need a face that's not mine that fits me
Just get me to forget misery
Yes indeed we just be
In misery yes indeed
We just be up high

When I'm with you
When I'm with you

[Chorus]

It's just the high that your givin' me (givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me (givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground.

You remind me of my Mercedes Benz
For you I spend all my years
You might wanna meet my friends
And I might wanna have your kids
I name 'em
Shaniqua
Bonita
Rashawn
And baby you can take me far away
See the moon and the stars
Now can't nobody do it like you do (what?)
I admit you got to go (what?)
Me and you, just us two
Spread my love like a swine flu
Ay, you got me high
Wanna touch the sky
You know you love me right?
Lets sing this lullaby
Yeah you could be my fast car
Maybe be my jaguar
Baby what you isn't are
Make me see the moon and stars
I wanna touch the moon
Get some of this poom, poom
Ride it like zoom, zoom
Make him drop this fruit of the loom
He want my peach fair
Victoria underwear
I love em, oh so swell
And yep he love my fruit cocktail
I keep it real baby
I love em crazy baby
I'm a name brand bitch
She just don't need it baby
You better stay with me
Sexy is what I need
I'm a F-A-S-T C-A-R M- ISS -E

[Chorus]

It's just the high that your givin' me (givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me (givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground.

(High that your givin' me)
(High that your givin' me)

[Chorus]
People going to let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people 
They're just people
People going to let you down
Don't expect for them to hold you down
They're just people
They're just people

Listen
Money crimes and mood swings
Situations where
Certain people will do things
Like
Hop on bandwagon
Get on the food chain
Soon as you get yo swag
That's when yo crew change
But we all equal
And people are just people
Leave it in God's hands
Cause the devil is lethal
You get what you earn
Also you live and you learn
To expect nothing in return
Do what you do from the heart
And then move on
Cause in the eyes of the ungrateful
You can do wrong
That's when the negative energy
Gets to strong
The sunshine leaves
In comes the true storm
Sometimes make you wanna do harm
But you fall back cause you too calm
To get all rowdy and evil
Cause you realize at the end of the day
They just people

[Chorus]

The bad ones discourage
The good ones motivate
The weak shall perish
The haters going show they hate
As long as you know what you dealing with
You can close the gate
Never let them in yo world
Till you know they straight
Huh cause then again they just people
Life's just a one stop deal
There's no sequel
Fake ones are so transparent
And so see through
Love ones can be so humble
When they need you
Some got they hands out even after you feed em
But they ain't ever around when you need em
That's when yo thoughts get evil
But then you realize they just people

[Chorus]

Ay yo I got a lot more living to do
Before I leave here
Cause I'm blessed and I'm thankful
And I'm happy to be here
In good health with good wealth
You could always use help
But all you really got is yo good self
Still what I go through
It hurts when people that know you
Let you down and don't hold you
But yo mistakes will teach you
Cause then you realize
They just people

Oh people 
Oh people
Oh
Oh
Oh people
Oh people
Oh
Oh
Don't you worry about a thing
They just people

Queen Latifah,"(The world oh, oh, oh the world x2)

I smoked pot up up again help
The pain to go away,
But it wouldn't go away,
Just subsided through the haze

Just drifted off into deeper thought
So I broke my mind and searched my heart
Finally whats blindin' me was just as clear as day.
I figured out whats stressin' me, depressin' me
Mummy that man was lancing me
No..

Was only 5 years old I couldn't seem to tell a soul
I didn't know how to let you and daddy know
And I can't go on, like this
That's the kinda thing that make ya slash your wrists
But now that I realise this
What happened to me I gotta fight this


[Chorus]
The devils are probably lyin' (runnin' round and lyin')
Tryin' to move out
Is he gonna take my crown?
Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours
Every second of every minute of every hour
I see your face

Help me with what happens in the world.


Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare.

(The world)

The world'll put you right on top
Then snatch the bottom from under you
And just watch and laugh as you drop

Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare.

(The world)

Whooooah..
The world'll put you right on top
Then snatch the bottom from under you
And just watch and laugh as you drop


Runnin' around the school as you tried committin' suicide
He asked what would make a 14 year old boy wanna take his life?
It'd be the fact, that he got a dad, who uses him, as a punchin' bag
Beats him till he's blue and black and wont stop will he makes him cry.

You kept it to your self and made excuses for the bruises,
Took painkiller to kill the pain from a daddy who's abusive,
He was telling you, you were useless
Never heard the words ""I love you""
Made you feel like you were worthless
He's tryin' to save the trouble and

He can't go on, like this
That's the type thing that made you slash you wrists
Somebody shoulda told you that you're priceless
Put your faith in god and we can fight this.

(chorus)
The devils are probably lyin' (runnin' round and lyin')

Where we leave our babies in the back seat of cars (cars)
Found my pass is blind (blind)
Desperate minds and emotional teenagers
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Well loves so right
You so never wanna test it
Who's your momma who your daddy?
You, can't even tell.
You're shinin' on chattin'
See news at eleven.
Were all walking through this place with
Vain visions of heaven

Queen Pen,"fI'm taking you back 
I'm taking you back 
Here's another one 

Uh yeah 
I remember being on that nigga's chair  hard 
Back in the day in the projects 
Chasing after him  a lil' young chick 
Seeing him made me go back in my lab 
And write this lil' shit like this 
Check it out 

Here's how it goes 
Used to see you when I went to the store 
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window 
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with 
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash 

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes 
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive 
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs 
With hopes to get close to you 

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep 
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets 
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet 
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet 

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew 
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you 
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do 
To give all my love to you, my God 

Can't feel myself 
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy 
There's not a minute, hour, day or night 

I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list 
'cause I'm always thinking of you 
(Take it to the bridge) 

All my love 
('Cause all my love's to you, my girl) 
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough 
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one) 
I just don't want to stop 
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much 
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge) 

Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew 
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew 
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning, 
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit 

Talked about that sex like I was used to it 
Lying about how many you used to kiss 
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real 
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels 

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that 
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched 
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt 
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work 

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad 
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young 
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you 
My God 

Can't feel myself 
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy 
There's not a minute, hour, day or night 

I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list 
'Cause I'm always thinking of you 
(Take it to the bridge) 

All my love 
('Cause all my love's to you, my girl) 
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough 
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one) 
I just don't want to stop 
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much 

The breakdown, now bounce to this 
Yeah, dedicated to the first love (right) 
Uh, you know who you are, from the hood 
It's all good (yeah) yeah 

We goin' bounce ta dis 
We make moves with this 
'Cause all my love's to you 
Now bounce",All My Love

Pull you out your closet, sex on weekends

Beefin 'bout that yellow chicken, the green benz

(chorus)
(verse 2)
Me'shell: so queen tell me, where did you meet her,

Queen Pen: On the sunday, mac, she was walking out ???
I was just chillin, mindin my own business
Sittin on the corner, waitin for my sister
When she slid by, maybe 4 or 5 times
Wanted me to notice the rhythm of her thighs
Oh boy, uh, girls are just so funny to me
I can see how niggas get into these beefs
She knew she had a man when she came up in the piece
She said she was a regular and how about me,
If she gave me her digits would i call her after three
The way she fliked her hips made you move to have to see
How these chinese jamaican tried to draw it by me
It never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Ain't nobody gotta know just how much you want me
(chorus)
(verse 3)
Now how i've ran, you've only a few
But you can back track and ask them how i do it how it is
Who the flyest chick, with the phattest whip
And run her all night, like a burger with a chip
And if it's all good then i feature it again
Like a fix remix, (if you need a fix)
See you gots to be real like my ex beverly
You don't have your man just stressin out on me
Coz he can't control how you throw your pussy
I'm a baller and i been for a ???
And if i choose to jerk her off then it's all on me
See you claimed that was your girl, well that's not how it seems
Uh, it never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Coz i like to get down so if you's wants ta i will
I love to love ya' baby

Oh Jack you're swingin' 
Make you shake your rump 

No dick or fee tellin' me this is what you want 
Baselines and snares that will make you funk 
Intimidated by his 14 year old 
At 97 he's a different kind of funk 

We push together like a perfect hand and tongue 
You pressed your luck and now your back to should be sunk 
Be coming, free the future, with yo' face punked 
Forgot about the past now what you want 
Platinum tracks to put you on the map 

'Cause we gotta keep it in the fam' 
You had yo' chance to be down wit da man 
So busy playa hatin', perpetuating, articulating 
Balla's down four, you can't take me 

What the deal ma 
Funkey Mama plays the track so you could feel, huh? 
I'll make a D, I'm all about the dolla' bills y'all 
Rock the diamond Lex while I sit behind my desk 
And sign the checks 

If you like hits baby 
Got 'em going crazy on Blackstreet 
You know it's plaque time when me and the track meet 
Save all yo whack beats, QP and TR so precise with mics 
We should be surgeons in E.R.

Baby girl be my diamond 'cause she rocks shows 
See my one's ain't no way that you can stop those 
Little man got your breath together 
With Queen Pen, now it's hot to death 

So take a look back 
What I did, what I'm doing, where I take this 
It's kinda simple 'cause it's nothing just to make hits 
Peep the facts, keep 'em stacked 
When the streets are Black 
Ladies scream he's the Mack 

'Cause I kick (what) 
Shit that make the fly chick you with my chick 
And plush funds just ridiculous 
'Cause I'm rich 
We are TR, you see, QP, that's we, Blackstreet, gone 

You can't take it 
(And now, here's the magnificent Funkey Mama) 

Now Teddy jam for me one time 
Enforce that then I'd make my hips bump and grind 
We'll just happen 
All this shit in this 'cause of platinum hits 
Little man be the shit, Funkey Mama represent 
It ain't never been no different 

And we got witnesses 
You account for all of this shit 
Just we, and get your block knocked off 
You can keep your I-pinion till you get there 

'Cause it don't matter 
We don't follow chit chatter 
We make hits 
And calls, my situations get thick 
Ask St. Nick, about the repertoire 
For those in the past, they know who they are 

If the shoe fits, trust 
We gon' wear it 
Can we be's the baddest clique up on this planet 
We paid the cost to be boss guys 
'Cause scare money don't win money, now drop it

Queen Pen,"Uh, it's all for you, my melody boo
This lovin' is all for you, break it down, how you feel about this

[Verse 1]
Reminiscing to back in our beginning
Sweet politicking in the heart of the village
We slid digits on low, exchanged a couple of 'hellos'
As you slid out the door
I remember clearly makin' moves up the steps we made eye contact
It was his gleam that brought me back, legit
How we met on some real ghetto star shit
Mad chicks on my melody's dick
See he got this kinda grace about himself
Dealin' with fast life all flooded up with wealth
So for him, cuties just be comin' like a dime a dozen
Smooth talkin' brothers always get easy fuckin'
But I ain't mad, at all of his cutie head lovin'
And all his playin hard to get was worth tryin' to get my loving
He's got personality for days
The kinda melody others bad talkin' many ways
The kinda beat that always stays paid, my special kinda boo who always 
Appreciates gettin' laid
My melody

Just the way. I want to be loved
Yeah

[Verse 2]
True, we been together from the very beginning
Since blocks be turned into states, baguettes be turned into cakes
So he be knowin' how I'm down by law
Plus his knowledge himself be havin' his mentality bore
He gets first bids when I'm blowin' in from tour
His sex is respected behind closed doors
Listen, he the bomb, I can't tell you different
It's a fact how he mystify me like Kaiser Sosack
Uh, it feels good to know how others wish they could be loved
In the clubs bitches screwin' up their mugs because
They envious to how my boo is true to this
Gold diggin' bitches always be disputing shit
That don't even concern them, I'm learnin'
The next chick that try to make your melody a B-track
But true, he be bigger than that
My boo be realizin' that his wifey'll always have his back, uh
Check out my melody

Cause you love me baby
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Communication be never a mess
Coz he be keepin' street conflict away from this relationship
He's got a mind of his own
He's a leader, not scared to be a dreamer, my black man digger
And I be down till the day that I die, loyalty bonafied
So how ask why I, dedicated all my love to his cause
Financially lock him down, hide his monies from the law cause
No matter what my melody be's a good man
No matter how he ran on the actions of his plan and
I be down till the day that I die
Loyalty bonafied, my melody and I

Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah, It's so nice lyin' here in you arms
Your personality has that charm
Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Oh I could stay here for the rest of my life
I want to be your lover, want to maybe you wife
Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah, yeah, you love me baby",My Melody
Queen Pen,"Yeah, it's ninety-seven going into ninety-eight,
And I've been doin' this for mad years, payin' dues.

Stronger, true.

Richard Stites.
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.

Growin' up, didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you.
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you.
Want to play you close and jump in the pool wit' you.
I don't know what to do, but this much is true,
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career,
And turn right around when you hot a gear.
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear;
That the man upstairs, he control this here
And it's funny how, soon as the money piles,
Everybody want to play with that brother now,
Run me down, but when the doe gets low, only a few friends roll, you know.
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife,
Said ""Lynisse, please do something with your life.""
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

And I remember when, I used to feen for calls,
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls.
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work,
Told her when I made it big, she never gonna work.
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street,
Hustlin', s***, they would live to the light,
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow.
To all my soldiers, I hold you down.
From standin' in the rain, to the rovers now.
I'm screamin your name, to warn you that the rollers is around,
To on-stage throwin' it down.
No matter where you at, represent your hood.
No matter where I'm at, I'm representing my hood.
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day,
Nobody in the block gave their life away.
We all tryin' to take it easily,
And everybody want to make it seems is free.
Today it's all good and it seemes so strange,
Since you look up in the hood now things done changed.
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks,
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks.
And b****es on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in,
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'.
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes.
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows.
Girls flow through with designer clothes.
It's day now, but you know how night time goes.
And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

...you know it's true!",It's True

We holding 20 plus we can follow if you choose
See ain't nothing changed, since the days of the Q
Except uh, elimination that wanna chew up my crew
Yes you, but you true I got to browse on through
You can catch me at the bar being shady to my old crew
How I do?  Make moves like I shoot
Catch me on the rebound, make at the tunnel

Peepin' shorties in my biz and seeing many

Plus that dress you wearin'
Got my whole team starin',

Lickin' the lips for real like you really want it
Is you dealing with the cat that's blunted?
Stay forever real shorty Ra', is you down
To go home wit' the champ a whole round?  You see
I had my eyes on you from way across the room
You looked so good from over here, I can smell your perfume
I assume, if I got ta come and  get ya
Ya'd think I was only out to hit ya, 
See, you's an intelligent chick
With that Nestle type of smile, 
Held my temptations back for awhile
Tell my brother Tah Lee, I'll be back, yeah
That's Pretty Lou and Spigg Nice, so watch my jacket
Make her touch to my lips, put the drink in my hand
'Till the center my legs expand

Better forget her for me and you

From New York City to Chicago too

Ya feelin' me?, damn sure
I had the answers for ya dancers
Since way back, puttin' it down like that

I came in the door, 20 or more
Watch the dancefloor, cause we like it raw
Dom got my head spinnin' like a set of rims
Nutta Butta like a pair of Timbs
What the deal shorty?, wanna rock with me
Take ya back, do the wop wit' me
Spend the cash like Monopoly

Rock chicks I'm dyin from boredom, please

So I can shine like six-four sittin on deez, huh
The less be y'all, the more for me
I put it down like bad kids, stop the madness, shit
I roast y'all bitches with ad libs
The garbage shit stops, when the hottest shit drops
And y'all can't front on how the shit knocks
Even haters, gotta love the STA-TUS, or the STAT-US

Hey you, want to debut number one like we do?
You gots to roll with my crew

Put it all together let it all gleam nice
Gotta pay a mean price you go against my click
And here's one thing y'all should never forget, that

Chorus

I run circles around you, verb'll straight serve you
Day to night we keep it tight like a girdle
Nine to five y'all should make it your job to
keep Queen Pen close to your ears like a bob
We make this, world revolve with this music of ours
From S-950's to music guitars
You know the program, let no man, interrupt your flow
And if that's your man, you better let him know
I'm like, Damien Oman, six-six-six
The way I be flowin is sick-sick-sick
Ice rope glowin, focus on the wrist, it takes
more than that to get close to dis
Straight hits on me with my nigga T.R. and

It's all in the timin and how the shit clicks

Queen Pen,"I'm taking you back
I'm taking you back
Here's another one

Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list
'cause I'm always thinking of you 
(Take it to the bridge)

All my love
(Cause all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't want to stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)

Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning, 
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit

Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you 
My God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list
'cause I'm always thinking of you

(Cause all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough

I just don't want to stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

The breakdown, now bounce to this
Yeah, dedicated to the first love (right)
Uh, you know who you are, from the hood
It's all good (yeah) yeah
We gon' bounce ta dis
We make moves with this

Queen Pen,"You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

[Chorus: x4]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spins the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Chorus: x4]

Cause that's my peeps and we row G
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be taking you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks never been my flavor
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncey
I be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30

I shouldn't loved him
I shouldn't wanted him
I shouldn't trust him
No I shouldn't fucked him
Now here I am carryin his seed
That makes two for him and a fourth for me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm wreckin my brain, tryna to figure out
How we can come to this, how we even came about
We never took the time to measure the proper amounts
Or beef we would cause of sneakin around
If my brother even knew shit he'd proably flip out
And up until tonight we never had doubts
remember the first time that you slept over my house?
We made love to Donnell Jones, damn we so foul
But now its been a year from that day today
We still meet in the cut I can't live this way
Can't be no more us, fuck you feelin lame
What about me feelin loved, is sex all that its worth?
When it comes to us, I know that you love me
Its deeper then a nut, I know that you care for me
Its deeper then a nut

[Chorus: 3x]

[Verse 2]
You keep blamin it on him clamin him as a friend
Talkin about you and that nigga is tight like brothers
Fuck him, and I can put that on my life
So what he my baby daddy he don't do his child right
Tryna to explain I got tears in my eyes
This lump in my throat tryna hold back my cries
You talkin about me and ya booze ain't wise
Me and you has a cup Queen it just ain't right
You said it could never be yo niggas B.D. a wife
Tell me how would it look to the rest of my crew
You fuckin wit me Queen that's just bad news
I'm breakin rules but we just can't stop
I said we in too deep I'm not killin ya seed
I say we in too deep nigga I'm keepin my seed

[Chorus: 3x]

[Verse 3]
It really broke my heart to see you pushin that whip
When you couldn't even cop a new coat for yo kid
It really broke my heart when you cocked backed on me
When I was six months pregnant still beatin on me
It really fucked me up how you put me in debt
Fuckin up QPs dollars and sense
To think I catch your doughs and your whiz in my crib
Jeporadize a lively hood on me and my kids
And which one of those seeds belong to you
God would've been better of makin a cat or a baboon instead of you
Nigga I mean you ain't worth shit
A man that don't take care of his kids ain't worth lint
Now here I am I'm in love wit yo friend
And the only thing standin in the way is you bitch!
I cursed the day I ever even accepted your dick
Your daughters father don't know you
Tell her yo father is yo friend,  bitch

Save your slick talk for Saturday night's at plex

That I stay pregnant forever, and live off of my publishing cheques?
All this bad chat got me kind of vexed
why'all been talkin about me ever since I fucked that nigga from Next
It's all over, I'm shuttin why'all down
By the end of the first quarter, why'all gone be sayin, ""Damn she foul""

Queens of the Stone Age,"I'm gonna suture up my future
I ain't jaded, I just hate it
See, I've been down too long
It's kinda hard to explain
Burned and buried all I carried
All my evils through a needle
As it pulled through the eye 
What was and will are all gone

Don't sweat it
Thread to forget it
To feel like you're already gone
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Take a picture, bury it all away
Bury it all away

Tried to fake it, I just can't take it
I don't care if it hurts
Just so long as it's real
I won't waste it, turned to face it

Tried explaining, done explaining
Got caught in the plaid
All this talking at once

To the things that tear it apart

Queens of the Stone Age,"Everyone it seems
Has somewhere to go
And the faster the world spins
The shorter the lights will glow
And I’m swimming in the night
Chasing down the moon
The deeper in the water
The more I long for you

Most of what you see my dear is purely for show
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just a fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
One thing that is clear it’s all down hill from here

My love in your hand cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone, crumble in the light

Most of what you see my dear
Is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of want to show
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Not everything that goes around, comes back around you know

It’s all down hill from here",...Like Clockwork

When the sun is gone so are
Well, so are you

Queens of the Stone Age,"Calling all comas,
Prisoner on the loose
Description:
A spitting image of me
Except for a heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prison of sleep
Deepened now
A rabbit hole never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone
Feelings, raw and exposed when I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
But dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in
As I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing,
No longer exist
One day I hope
I'm someone you'd met

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper I sleep
Further down
A rabbit hole never to be found

It's only falling in love
Because you hit the ground

Dancing on wire both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing,
No longer exist

I'm someone you'd met

Queens of the Stone Age,"I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby to erase you
Face down in the boulevard yet I couldn't face you

There ain't no use in cryin'
It doesn't change anything, so baby what good does it do?
Your friends they'll sympathize, maybe I don't need them to

Imagine I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, 'Boy if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new'
'Do you know who you really are? Are you sure it's really you'?
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Imagine I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

So ominously blue

Queensrÿche,"From the night comes a roar of thunder
Beholding light on the spell you're under
And the signs of death descend your way
Fighting back from the devil's hunger
Freeing souls from their chosen number
And the sword of right will guide your way

And thus you'll find that only demons fill your mind until you wake
But only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from today

Burning dreams cause your mind to wonder
Iron crosses are the calling numbers
And the fight for the answer still remains old

But the night will reflect the hunger
And the blackness will pull you under
Still the sword of right will guide your way

And in the night you'll hear the voices calling down and they will stay

You scream but no one listens
Again you cry - give me sanctuary

Is raised in solemn grace
His eyes once wide with learning wonder
Now leave stains upon his face

Once busy hands are idle now

All alone now
Except for the memories
Of what we had and what we knew
Every time I try to leave it behind me
I see something that reminds me of you
Every night the dreams return to haunt me
Your rosary wrapped around your throat
I lie awake and sweat, afraid to fall asleep
I see your face looking back at me, looking back at me

And I raise my head and stare
Into the eyes of a stranger
I've always known that the mirror never lies
People always turn away
From the eyes of a stranger
Afraid to know what
Lies behind the stare

Is this all that's left
Of my life before me
Straight jacket memories, sedative highs
No happy ending like they've always promised
There's got to be something left for me
And I raise my head and stare
Into the eyes of a stranger
I've always known that the mirror never lies
People always turn away
From the eyes of a stranger
Afraid to know what
Lies behind the stare (Lies behind my stare)

How many times must I live this tragedy
How many more lies will they tell me
All I want is the same as everyone
Why am I here, and for how long

Queensrÿche,"I awoke on impact
Under surveillance from the camera eye
Searching high and low
The criminal mind found at the scene of the crime
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it
She said she loved me
I guess I never knew
But do we ever, ever really know?
She said she'd meet me on the other side
But I knew right then, I'd never find her

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No more nightmares, I've seen them all
From the day I was born
They've haunted my every move
Every open hand's there to push and shove
No time for love it doesn't matter
She made a difference
I guess she had a way
Of making every night seem bright as day
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I need to forget her face, I see it still
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No chance for contact
There's no raison d'etre
My only hope is one day I'll forget
The pain of knowing what can never be
With or without love it's all the same to me

Ten P.M., I feel the rain coming down
My face feels the wet, my mind the storm
Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour
Moving silent, through the streets, they're mine, they're mine

Midnight, she sings praises in the Hall
To saintly faces hallowed be their names she can't recall
Sister Mary, virgin Mary, silent with her sin
(""What are you doing out in the rain?"")
She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks
(""I've been waiting for you, come in"")

Mary, Mary just a whore for the underground
(They made you pay in guilt for your salvation)
Thought you had them fooled? Now they've sent me for you
You know too much for your own good
Don't offer me faith, I've got all I need here
(My faith is growing, growing tight against the seam)
What we need is trust, to keep us both alive
Help us make it through the night

I've no more want of any faith
Binds my arm and feed my mind
The only peace I've ever known
I'll close my eyes and you shoot

No Mary, listen, you've got to pull your strength 
(From my lips, I pray I feed you well)
Your precious cross is gone, it made me wait so long
For what you gave to everyone
The priest is cold and dead on his knees he fed
(From my barrel of death, he turned)
The Holy water red, as he died he said ""thank you""
I just watched him bleed

I feel the flow, the blessed stain
Sweating hands like fire, and flames
Burn my thighs, spread in sacrificial right
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight

Mary, my lady of pain
Always alone
Blind you search for the truth
I see myself in you, parallel lives
Winding at light-speed through time

No time to rest yet
We've got to stop his game
(Before madness has the final laugh)
Too much bloodshed
We're being used and fed
Like rats in experiments
There's no final outcome here
Only pain and fear
(It's followed us both all our lives)
There's one thing left to see
Will it be him or me?
There's one more candle left to light

Don't turn your back on my disgrace
The blood of Christ can't heal my wounds, so deep
The sins of man are all I taste
Can't spit the memory from my mind
I can't cry anymore

Guess I'll leave the light on for you
It's just another rainy night without you

Listen, there's a foghorn blowing from the coast tonight
Remember making love in the rain?
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
Raindrops taste like tears, without the pain
I'm not much without you, can't leave if I wanted to
Maybe that's why you stay around

But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called

I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you
Waiting by the phone alone
It's just another rainy night, without you
Guess I'll leave a light on for you

But my dream is still alive
I'm going to be the best I can

I want to be a busy man
I want to see a change in the future
I'm gonna make the best of what I have
I want to write for a magazine

You were the wonder of the crumbling neighborhood

Showed me that my will survived
The tragedy that came into my life
Giving me hope and the new start that I have

And I won't let go
Gotta make the grae no, I won't let go
To be the best man, the best man that I can

Step by step I dream the plan
From my chair to walking man
This constant dream is on my mind
Chase the light I see ahead
Luminate the path I tread
I live to be the best I can

Now I'm moving forward and I'm never looking back
Straight ahead, focused on the big attack
On a roll and I'm never slowing down
I won't be torn between
The man in the chair and the man that's in my dream
I'm going to melt the two men into one

Paranoid, I melt into myself.
They say I'm to reach inside and find
the broken part of my machinery.

on the path to my darkest day.
Searching for the answers,
all I see is damage through the haze.
Picking up the pieces of my life
with no direction for re-assembly.
The one that lays beside me
is sharing scars of my broken yesterdays.
Will tomorrow find me hypnotized? Crying?
Mother Mary in control,
domineering stranglehold
sowing destructive seeds
for the scavengers to feed.
Driving the nail into my head,
memory flows like a river.
With the one that lays beside me
I'm healing scars from my childhood memories.

Old man is strapped to the seat of his chair, wearing a gown.

Because it's not what I expected.

Somewhere along the way
Friends I once held close fled the fast lane.
I didn't notice, I just had to make it.
Head down, nose in the grindstone;
The kiss of life placed on my brow
Kept sliddin' to the ground
And now it's buried six feet under.

What's the use in even holding on?
Here's to love, hate, and promises.

Almost called it today.
Turned to face ""The Void""
Numb with the suffering
And the question,
""Why am I?""
So many times I've tried and failed to
Gather my courage, reach again for that nail.
Life's been like
Dragging feet through sand,
And never finding,

I recognize the changes.
I feel like I did before the
Magic wore thin and the ""baptism
Of stains"" began.

They used to say I was
Nowhere, man,
Heading down
Was my destiny.
But yesterday, I swear,
That was someone else not me.

Afraid to reach out for eternity,
One step, when I look down,
I see someone else not me.

Looking back and I see

Was going down,

Stronger, proud.
And today I know there's
So much more I can be.

From where I stand at the crossroads edge,
There's a path leading out to sea.
And from somewhere
Deep in my mind,

Queensrÿche,"Taken to a place underground,
A cavern, ten thousand steps down
The only light was fire fly glow,
Reflecting in the blue crystal show
Feeling in the darkness surrounding me,
Roots of giant Sequoia trees
Anchor the canopy of life that's above
The answer to the mystery of life is

Traveled through the jungles of the Yucatan
And drank the potion from the magic man
Held the starlight inches from my face,
Pushed the door open, # 7.
I walked the path way to heaven
Saw the same face of God.

[Chorus]
Seems every where I go
I see the same face, I feel the same flow.
With every one I meet and every hand I shake,
I'm every man, trying my best to get to know
Because everything's at stake

[Verse]
We're the same tribe.
Passing through Morocco for the faithful is a trip
Hallucinating visions drives my desert ship
For a thousand miles we could not fail,
Can't enjoy if you can't inhale
Clearly a lifetimes need of some experience and
For the record, peace

[Chorus]
Seems every where I go
I see the same face, I feel the same flow
With every one I meet and every hand I shake,
I see myself in every man, trying my best to get to know
Because everything's at stake

We're the same tribe",Tribe
Queensrÿche,"""I've had enough and I want out!""
""You can't walk away now"" 

I looked back once
And all I saw was his face
Smiling, the needle crying
Walking out of his room
With mirrors, afraid I heard him scream
You'll never get away

Cold and shaking
I crawled down alleys to try
And scrape away the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall

(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name

Wet and raving
The needle keeps calling me back
To bloody my hands forever
Carved my cure with the blade
That left me in scars
Now every time I'm weak
Words scream from my arm

(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name
(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name",The Needle Lies [Live]
Queensrÿche,"You think you're smart, inventive
Because you've figured out my game?
Pride is a handy substitute
When you've got only yourself to blame

All my dreams I've realized while you were indisposed
While you've spent eighteen years watching TV
I've watched my fortune grow

Here I am I'm finally on the outside and
You're nowhere near where I've been
I've got you where I want you at last
You've got no idea who I am

We circle around each other waiting for reaction
We circle around each other waiting for reaction
Wanting satisfaction for the past
I want nothing from the past

Always been so easy you're like a puppet on my string
Throwing down hollow threats, unsure of what to think
Why should I care? You wouldn't dare
You're nothing but worthless I swear

From where I stand I've got you where I want you
You'll never take me! Never take me down
I've seen all I need to put you in the ground
Revenge is normal, a typical reaction

I've seen your cynical reaction
If you're standing outside of in
Always on the outside of in

Here we are at last facing oblivion
And this is where finally it ends
You don't belong here
Holding fast to each of our sins

With hope by my side, I'll survive to see the dawn
Believe me or not you owe me, I owe you nothing
I gave your life a purpose
I owe you nothing but your death
Without me you wouldn't have learned a thing

",The Chase
Queensrÿche,"Every time I leave
You say you won't be there.
And you're always there.
Every time I cry your name at night,
you pull close and say it's alright.
I look in your eyes, just like the rain.
Washing me, rain wash over me.
Touching your face, I feel the heat
of your heartbeat echo in my head like a scream.
What you do to me!
Waited so long I can't wait another day without you.

Jet City Woman.
It's a long way, home to my
Jet City Woman.
I see her face everywhere, can't get her out of my mind.

Whenever I'm alone I'm thinking,
there's a part missing from my life.
Wonder where I'd be without your love
holding me together now I'm
watching the time tick, tick away.
Face grows longer every day.
Fortunes are lost on the women I've seen
but without you I can't breathe!
You're the air to me!
Waited so long, I'm all alone thinking about you.

Jet City Woman.
Got to find my way home to her.
Jet City Woman.
I see her face everywhere I look!
Jet City Woman.
Just a thousand miles and I'll be there
Jet City Woman, to make the clouds go away.
Time for some blue sky!

Waited so long now the plane's delayed
and hour, reminds me of all our days apart.
Hold on, just a little longer.

Jet City Woman.
Wonder where I'd be, you're the air to me.

No more nights alone I'm almost home now.

Queensrÿche,"You've got a cardboard house
Live there all the time
Keep your memories tied with string
The face that many once adored
Twenty years gone maybe more
Somewhere you lost the dream
Mama watched your every move,
But now you're all alone, oh yeah

She's been gone for awhile
Daddy left some time ago, 
Fading years pass too slow
He's the only one, could make you smile
Oh, you're still crying

Big city bound
Gonna make your mark
Read your name in the lights
All the ads and people say,
Beauty lets you get you way
Tried your best to prove them right

But living on the streets ain't bad, 
Sad people make you glad
Pardon me, could you spare some change
Oh, you're still crying

Street corner girl
Watch the crowd go by
Fill your tin can with life
Summer days tend to slip away
Like your men you couldn't make them stay
Hard to choose, whiskey or a wife
Sometimes you wonder where's the end
Where you goin' where you been?
Happiness seems so hard to win
Most never care to find

Queensrÿche,"Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over, or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize it and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity

(Record it in the present tense)
(Put it into a permanent form)
(If you persist in your efforts)
(You can achieve dream control)
(Dream control)
(How's that then, better?)
(Hug me)

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help to see it through
I will protect you in the night

Queensrÿche,"Almost cut my hair
It happened just the other day
It's gettin' kind of long
I could've said it was in my way

But I didn't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
And I feel like I owe it to someone

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I'm not feeling up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car

Well, I'm not giving in an inch to fear
'Cause I've promised myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone

When I finally get myself together
I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather

And I'm goin' to find a space inside to laugh
Separate the wheat from the chaff
I feel like I owe it to someone, yeah",Almost Cut My Hair
Queensrÿche,"In the howling wind comes a stinging rain

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome

You raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses
See the flames higher and higher

This guy comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colors of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slapping them down
One hundred, two hundred
And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
You take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside is America
Outside is America

Across the field you see the sky ripped open
See the rain through a gaping wound
Pounding on the women and children
Who run
Into the arms

Queensrÿche,"There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

I think it's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

What a field-day for the heat?
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

At last, all too well I can see
Where we all soon will be

If you strip away
The myth from the man
You will see where we all soon will be

Jesus, You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good You've done
Will soon be swept away
You begun to matter more
Than the things You say

Listen, Jesus I don't like what I see
All I ask is that You listen to me
And remember, I've been Your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt You when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called You a man
And believe me, my admiration for You hasn't died
But every word You say today, is twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt You if they think You've lied

Nazareth's your famous Son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like His father carving wood
He'd have made good, tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm no one alarm

Listen Jesus, do You care for Your race?
Don't You see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied, have You forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd for we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far, if we go too far

Listen, Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour

Surrender your ego, be free, be free to yourself

If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears, release your mask

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake

There's only so much more that he can take

He doesn't think to wonder why

Cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch

Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now looming in his headlights

Is for you to tell me that you miss me.
Will you wait for me?
Remember me, please.

Just wait one minute. Give me a chance
And I'll make you see just what you really
Mean to me.
It took a living hell to
Show me. All I want is to be with you.
You know that what I say is true.


I promise when I get back home
I'll be the man you used to know.
And I won't spend another day
Without you, girl.
I need your strength.

Please stay and

Queensrÿche,"I’ve known life but I lay here empty
My eyes are closed but I find no rest
I clutch the phone I just love her

My clothes are soaked, can’t catch my breath
Voices that hang on for a little longer
I feel the weight of the world

But then… then again every story ends

Queensrÿche,"I awoke on impact
Under surveillance from the camera eye
Searching high and low
The criminal mind found at the scene of the crime
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it
She said she loved me
I guess I never knew
But do we ever, ever really know?
She said she'd meet me on the other side
But I knew right then, I'd never find her

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No more nightmares, I've seen them all
From the day I was born
They've haunted my every move
Every open hand's there to push and shove
No time for love it doesn't matter
She made a difference
I guess she had a way
Of making every night seem bright as day
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I need to forget her face, I see it still
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No chance for contact
There's no raison d'etre
My only hope is one day I'll forget
The pain of knowing what can never be
With or without love it's all the same to me

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real

No longer a victim of change

Wonder what’s around us?
Do we take for granted

Promises don’t mean a thing
Like a hunt without the kill

Do we ever take the time
To see what comes and what goes by?
Do we ever stop to see
Just who we'll leave behind?

Who are you leaving behind?

Divided unity of man
Disconnected circuitry

No remorse
They have no sense of apathy
Critical mass on its way
Who is searching for the truth?

Desensitize the innocent
Quick to medicate the youth

As the wise man waits
The widow prays
Searching remnants of yesterday

And the shadows cry
When darkness fades
We try to understand
Under moonlit skies

A charade in broken frames
Gather pieces from the past
Shape the species over time
Moralities collapse

Suppress the meek and mild

Stuck in the middle of the truth
Crawl through the walls of this passage you’ll find
The state of your mind

Patterns shifting, slowly moving
This consecrated ground that I stand

Piercing screams in my head

Of rain on the rooftop
Velvet draped across the floor…mmmm

Was a time when we measured
But never up to our fathers
The sorrow cuts
And as I stare at the blade
You've reached the dark we fear

Locked
Stitches in time
Nothing can break apart our seams

You were humble and kind
Pondering times
As I sit in a shrine
Never meant to be

Rebuilding a passion that never saw a highway
How many more miles would you bare my friend?
Like a jab to the throat
Surrealism silenced the voice
But what is left to say?

And all I can think is thank you for your time
As I reflect with pain

Locked

Nothing can break apart our seams

You were humble and kind
Pondering times

Like a gift to a stranger brings a smile to the face
You’re my solitude, my serenity, with an angel’s face

Hearing the sounds of a cry (ssh)
Peacefully sleep to a lullaby (oh)

A silent movie scene, a capsule in time
The days when we were young, all we had was time
We’ll ride this train all the way to the heavens
Just you and me hand in hand

My mother’s voice calling out to me
From the other side patiently

Slip inside my dream, carry me away
Time goes by
No matter what you say or do I still love you
Times goes by
But with you now the days get longer

Reflections of time, they’re yours and mine
The things that used to be still remain so fine
Is the face of a child your calm embrace?
You’re my shining star of the darkest night, a saving grace

Seeing the signs of the times
Forever is now there’s no rewind

I heard you singing
What were you singing when the people got right?
Were you singing Stand and Deliver?
Or was it Down by the River?
Were you singing a fine old tune like Gone to Glory?
Laying it down with grace and power
Long about the midnight hour

I heard the people all singing
Like they'd never sung before
All over the country
Who could help but stand beside you?

Hello, hello - is there anybody here?
My knuckles are sore from rapping all day
I said: Give me one more chance
I'd do it for you if I had your way
If I had your way

What do I know? What do I see?
Don't know nothing but the name of the game
It's high-card draw with everything wild
You bet your life like anyone's child
What else would you want to do?

I heard the people all singing
Like they never sung before
Singing in key and strumming
Everything they heard from you
Hello, hello, hello, hello ... goodbye

Looking back across the years
Other matters disappear
In the murmur I can hear
Familiar voices loud and clear
Hello, hello, hello, hello ... goodbye

I heard you singing
Like one last song in the middle of the night
Were you singing in tongues of fire
Or was it knots of anger?

Were you singing a fine old tune like
Love Me, Love Me, Love Me Only?
Were you caught btween the curtains
Thinking this was too uncertain?

Remember ... the people were singing
Like they never sung before
All over the country
Did you love the way they loved you?

Ain't no knocker on the last big door
Just push on the panel and walk on in
Hello, hello, is there anybody here
But a two-bit high and a busted mirror?
Hello, hello - is anybody here?
My tongue is so sore from rapping all day

Sunshine in the dead on night
I know that can't be right
Could it be? I don't know
But it never done that thing before
So close to my own back door
It got me wondering what to do
And the only thing was to come and tell you
Because - I heard you singing - I heard you
",I Heard You Singing

One was dark, one was fair, followed by the hawk, mothered by the mare.

I've been down so many timnes that I don't mind it.
Seen the light so many times that I don't like it
Can you feel the darkness chase away the sunshine?
The sun won't shine on me, I'll be okay, and I feel fine.

I feel fine.",I Was Humming a New Song to Myself
Quiet Company,"Love me when I'm complex, tolerate me when I'm not
Love will be the shotgun that we'll fire to scare them off

I know that we ain't got much, but darling, it's enough
I pray that our friends will up and disappear all the time.

Heal my hear if it's broken, lift me up when it weighs me down
Love will levitate me, serve, and save me, and pull me out

From the snares of a pointless life
To the arms of a loving wife
I pray that our lives
Are gonna settle down
All the time

There's a light in your eyes that says
I don't need anything but your smile and some rest
And it's the way that your hand fits in mine
Like two puzzle pieces so perfectly designed
And if you hold on to me like I hold on to you
I know we're gonna be alright",Love Is a Shotgun
Quiet Company,"Watching my days go by
I'm sitting here without you
I think that I
May be aging all too rapidly
You might not recognize me soon

How I'd love to be in your arms
Relaxed under the trees
Of the rocket park
The skies are blue
And Texas surrounds you so gracefully

How many times did I look at you?
And wish that you were mine?
I need you now to hold my hand
And whisper softly and tell me
I'm your man",So Gracefully
Quiet Company,"I'm gonna buy a house for everyone I love
And we'll all reside above the empty streets
And I'm gonna dig a grave for everyone I hate
When their lives get in my way

Won't you please give me something to calm my weary mind
Because I did not have the time to work it out

There are angels in my bedroom, they've been sleeping on my fan
They say, ""Sweet Taylor, lift your eyes up and understand
That the world, it keeps on moving at an uncompromising pace
So keep the spring under your step and keep the sunlight on your face.""

You've got to raise your voice sometimes to get things done
I'm not the monster here.
You've got to break some legs sometimes to get things done.
I'm not the monster here.

You've got to make time to break bones!
You're never gonna calm me down!

And if you want to put me away, you're gonna need a miracle.",Tie Your Monster Down
Quiet Company,"I've been asleep for days
And your love compelled my heart to wake
Now life is so full and sweet
You're my doll, and you make my life complete

So we'll do everything right
And tuck the kids in at night
We'll be happy 'til we die.

All that we need we'll have
All the luxuries, the treasures, all the pleasures and the fads
We'll surely fit into the plan
With a cheap gold ring, and a cheap gold band

And the money is safe in the bank
With the cars in the driveway, the bills are all paid
The kids off to colleges (they grow up so fast)
But love always lasts

On my death bed
You're beside me
Like it should be at the end of my journey
Heaven oustretched
Its perfect arms to me
Earth beneath me and time behind me
Heaven outstretched
Its perfect arms to me
Hell below me
And angels singing ""Hallelujah""

'Oh, come back to me...'",We Change Lives
Quiet Company,"I wanted to say
That I had a dead man
On my back yesterday
But I cut him loose

Because there's so much at stake
When you try to live life half awake
I made my mistakes
I cut him loose

And I'm trying to hold on to hope.

I happened upon
A girl with a love
Too big for her heart
So she rented it out
To the boys who needed her quick

Then when she was old she thought
That she felt death in her soul
Her heart had grown cold
From all the nights that it spent alone

Trying to hold on to hope

That this wouldn't be
Quite what she needs
She felt so alive
Under the sheets
But I won't condemn you
You know I won't judge you
I won't condemn you, love.

We're gonna make some good of this.",Well Behaved Women Rarely Make History

Innocent fantasies
Never ended from room to room

Dressed up for sharades
Every guest has a part to play
And the rules are understood

That it's me and it's you

At the Twilight Hotel
Check your soul at the door
They've got memories to sell
And so much more

Fast talkin' it promises
Never really reaching the lines

Seems to bizarre
Such a twisted reality
This place full of manic minds

It's like a dreamland
With time standing still
So make your big plans
They've got all the frills

At the Twilight Hotel

He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

I'm waiting for the right time
To see if she will know the things 
She doesn't say to me

And I feel the way I feel
Because I need you all the time
And I know the things you know
But that's just not enough to make it mine
And I won't do anything that it might
Compromise this time
So I'll just sit and hold my breath
Only that's not enough to make you mine

Get up it's time to die
Just guess and don't ask why
Be late and just don't try
Someday we will fly
Higher than the satellites
Into a spacial paradise
Where up is up and down is down
And no one is around
(I don't want to see you crying)
(Let's leave)
(The dramatics behind)

And I feel the way I feel
Because I need you all the time
And I know the things you know
But that's just not enough to make it mine

These words would come back to me
I never wanted my choices to
Be happy like this

Just let me go in 
Without your love
And let me begin
To find in us
A love that could find another way
In you somehow

I talked to her a thousand times before
This time she fell to pieces
I, I won't insist upon telling the truth
I've always thought guys like me wouldn't 
Be happy like this

You could be brought back to the class
I thought I knew

I talked to her a thousand times before
This time she fell to pieces
I wanted her to act like she did before
But this time she fell to pieces

But it's all in time 
(I talked to her a thousand times before)
And it's all this time

So I hope with my life
She doesn't find out the truth

Here's all the things that I remember
I've wanted to tell you the truth

Never knowing the other was around
Read from the same damn books

I've lost my mind

Separada do marido está morando sozinha
Além dela ser bonita é um poço de bondade
Vendo meu carro na chuva ofereceu sua garagem

Ela disse, ninguém usa desde que ele me deixou
Dentro da minha garagem teias de aranha juntou
Põe teu carro aqui dentro, se não vai enferrujar
A garagem é usada mas teu carro vai gostar

Ponho o carro, tiro o carro, à hora que eu quiser
Que garagem apertadinha, que doçura de mulher
Tiro cedo e ponho à noite, e às vezes à tardinha
Estava até mudando o óleo na garagem da vizinha

Ponho o carro, tiro o carro, à hora que eu quiser
Que garagem apertadinha, que doçura de mulher
Tiro cedo e ponho à noite, e às vezes à tardinha
Estava até mudando o óleo na garagem da vizinha

Só que o meu possante carro, tem um bonito atrelado
Que eu uso pra vender cocos e ganhar mais um trocado
A garagem é pequena, o que é que eu faço agora?
O meu carro fica dentro, os cocos ficam de fora
A minha vizinha é boa, da garagem vou cuidar
Na porta mato cresceu, dei um jeito de cortar
A bondade da vizinha, é coisa de outro mundo
Quando não uso a da frente, uso a garagem do fundo

Ponho o carro, tiro o carro, à hora que eu quiser
Que garagem apertadinha, que doçura de mulher
Tiro cedo e ponho à noite, e às vezes à tardinha
Estava até mudando o óleo na garagem da vizinha

Stayed beneath my feet before.

Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.

A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.
Oo love me.

Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby.

Don't let this feeling end, 
Let it go on and on and on now baby.
 
Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes, 
I care not for myself but for those 
Who've never felt the joy we've felt.
Whenever you are near,
I Hear A Symphony each time you speak to me 
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love.
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me 
Whispering how much you care,
A thousand violins fill the air now.
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end,
Keep standing close to me,

Oh, oh, oh

Well, the first time I saw you
Was the first time I lost you
And the first time I kissed you
Was the first time I missed you

There were times when we tried to
Get by with some love too
But the things that we went through
Were so cold, don't let me remind you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you'll take my love
And just walk away

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Are the games that we're playing
Simply our way of entertaining

Since the start you don't seem to
Realize what I've been through
Since the start I have tried to
Make you see that I need you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you'll take my love
And just walk away

And at times when we drift to
Our knees but forgot to
Leave behind all the past fun
Sometimes I find it hard to comfort
Wonder why we're not one

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Is it love that we're missing

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Tell me is it love that we're missing

I tried so hard to make it work
But it seems to me, only got hurt

Is it love that we're missing

Quincy Jones,"Loving you came easily
Yet it made me blind to all there was to see
Now my heart is filled with pain

You understand I never will
How did it come to be that you don't love me still?
Now it's getting to be plain

If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
If you cared about more than yourself
I bet ya wouldn't go
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
If you cared about more than yourself
You wouldn't walk out the door

Though some days the blues was our parade,
Still we marched through all the tears we made
Now I find that it wasn't no game of charades that you played

I did my best to bring you joy
How can you just leave me like a broken toy?
Where's the man that once was you?

If I could be within your mind
I would never think to treat you this unkind
The pain you caused will come to you",Betcha' Wouldn't Hurt Me
Quincy Jones,"Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins she loves let them play
Dedicate her fav'right song and hold
Her closer all night long
Lover her today
Find one hundred ways

Don't forget there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more
Why don't you say
Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways

Bein' cool won't help you keep a love warm
You'll just blow your chance
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance

Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If there's one more star she wants
Go all the way

In your arms tonight
She'll reflect that she owes you
The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay
Find one hundred ways

In your arms tonight
She'll reflect that she owes you
The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay
Find one hundred ways

Ya gotta believe it whoa
Love her today
Find one hundred ways",One Hundred Ways

Now the rain's a-fallin', hear the train a-callin, ""Whooee!""

And take my word, that mockingbird’ll sing the saddest kind of song, he knows things are wrong, and he's so right

Octobers drifting into Mays
You set your sail when the tide comes in
And you cast your fate to the wind

You shift your course along the breeze
Won't sail up wind on memories
The empty sky is your best friend
And you just cast your fate to the wind

That time has such a way of changing a man throughout the years
And now you're rearranging your life through all your tears
Alone, alone

There never was, there couldn't be
A place in time for men to be
Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day
And let their wildest dreams blow away

Ice-T, let me kick my credentials
A young player, bred in South Central
L.A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
Rap on my record, man, Kimiko, send Ice the beat""

The Dude took me on a magic journey
To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

Back up and give the brother room 
To let poetry bloom to whom

As I reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about a twist
Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so
Jesse Jackson, Miss America a black one
No more livin for just a small fraction

To nourish, so to conclude

An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

That they named it after Bird
Where the rythym swooped and swirled

Baby, show me
Let me share the mystery, oh

Come on, come on, come on, come on

I've got the secret key to you
Let's make music, harmonizing ecstasy
Come on, come on, come on, come on

Quincy Jones,"Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And baby you never will

When love was only in the mind
I realize
Ain't no second chance
You got to hold on to romance
Don't let it slide

There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share

Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh-so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to living without you

Spendin' every dime
To keep you talkin' on the line
That's how it was

And all those walks together
Out in any kind of weather
Just because

There's a brand new way of looking at your life
When you know that love is standing by your side

Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh-so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to living without you

The night can be cold
There's a chill to every evening when you're all alone
Don't talk anymore
'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm

Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh-so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me

Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on
Come and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just met me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes

In the clear blue sky
How I worry bout you
Just can't live my life without you

Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love
So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again so baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you and get a release from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet

See I never wanted nothing
That belonged to someone else

I want you all for myself

I want to be your lover 
Wish I could tell you so
But I'll keep it close to my heart
Until she lets you go

I want something that I cannot have
Something beautiful
Something just out of my grasp
I want something that I cannot have
I want you babe
I want you so bad

I see you everyday but you'd never know
The way I feel inside
I have no right to tell you so
This is a love that I've got to hide
But I can't help wonder
If you ever know
Would you feel the same way baby that I do

I want to be your lover 
Wish I could tell you so
But I'll keep it close to my heart
Until she lets you go

I want something that I cannot have
Something beautiful
Something just out of my grasp

Another heart has been lost
Their cards have been dealt
Yeah the dice have been tossed 
I've gotta find a way
To make you mine someday

I want to be your lover
Wish I could tell you so
But I'll keep it close to my heart
Until you let her go

Something beautiful
Something just out of my grasp
I want something that I cannot have
I want you babe 
I want you so bad

And leave my heart with some happiness

If this is the last time that I'm ever gonna hold you
Let me hold you tight 'til the morning light
If this is the last time, ooh, we?ll ever be together
Then kiss me and baby, give me something to remember you by

Put your heart next to mine
Tonight, give me a chance to feel heaven just one more time
And ooh, if your leavin?, well honey, I?ll set you free
Just leave my arms with one sweet memory

Quincy Jones,"From too much talk to silent touches
Sweet touches
We turned our hearts to love
Then tried it, first time romance
There in the quiet, love learns to dance

We loved, we slept, we left the lights on
The night's gone and morning
Finds us caught in life's most sensible trance
Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance

Old songs, a new life
And hearts that understand like ours
And old dreams find young wings
In silence, in silence

From too much talk to loving touches
Love touches
When pure emotion takes the moment
We take the chance
Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance

Love wants to dance",Love Dance
Quincy Jones,"Hasn't always been a sunny day
Now and then there's been a little rain
But together we remain
Nothing to lose, everything to gain
And I can't imagine what a day would be
If there never was a you and me
Just know I'll be here always
Through the years I have come to know
Rain makes a flower grow
And if it must rain let it pour
'Cause I'll be your strength and much more,

I am yours
It doesn't matter what tomorrow brings
I'm yours
If we were rich and we lost everything
I'm yours
We'll be a love for all the world to see
I'm yours
I know that you are mine
Just know that I am yours

Like the sun on the morning dew
Everyday I feel renewed
Still room in my heart to fall more in love with you
If ever there was a bond between two
Even closer than the stars and the moon
I don't ever have to say a word
My heart can talk to you
You give me pleasure and
Nothing's better than
Showing you love in return
You are the one I adore,

That's why I am yours
It doesn't matter what tomorrow brings
I'm yours
If we were rich and we lost everything

We'll be a love for all the world to see

I know that you are mine
Just know that I am yours

I'll be yours until the end of time
Then we'll start over in another life
Nothing means more to me
Forever I will be

Your lightning and thunder
Sets my poor heart ablaze
You see girl
You thrill me, half kill me
That's what you do

Ai no corrida, that's where I am
You send me there
You dream is my command
Ai no corrida, I find myself
No other thought
Just you and nothing else
You and nothing else

I hold you, I touch you
In a maze can't find my way
I think you, I drink you
I'm being served you on a tray
You see girl
That's what I go through every day
Is this the way it should feel?

Pinch me, I'm dreaming
But if it is, don't let me know
I'm drowning, don't save me
It's just the way I'd like to go
You see girl
You thrill me, half kill me
That's what you do

Ai no corrida, that's where I am
You send me there
You dream is my command
Ai no corrida, I find myself
No other thought
Just you and nothing else
You and nothing else

Ai no corrida, that's where I am
You send me there
You dream is my command
Ai no corrida, I find myself
No other thought
Just you and nothing else",Ai No Corrida [Single Version]
Quincy Jones,"What would i give to hold you once again
What would i give to make this loneliness end
If i could bring you back
Back to where this love once lived
What would i give?
Everything

What would i do for one more precious moment with you
What would it take to make your heart hear the truth
To ease our pain i caused
Make up for the time i lost with you
What would i do?
Anything

Are you doing all right?
Have you found a life apart from me?
As it bring(s) you happiness
I don't want to know about it
'cause night after night i try to fight the emptiness
In this quiet room
Life goes on without you

Where would i go
If only you would ask me to
No road is too long if it would lead me back to you
Somehow i found a way
If you called to say that you need me there
Where would i go?
Anywhere

Are you doing all right?
Have you found a life apart from me?
For now i must confess
That i don't want to talk about it
'cause night after night i try to fight the emptiness
In this silent room
There's no peace without you

What would i give to hear you say you love me again
What would it take to make this loneliness end
If i could bring you back
Back to where this love once lived
What would i give?

What would i do?
Anything

What would i give? oh...

On a day when problems get me down
It's nice to think about the love we found
All I need is you and I'll get by
And though the years may make me old and grey
Darlin' you'll still take my breath away
'cause time can't change the warmth 
Inside your smile

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful

Baby since you went away,
Things they haven't gone my way
My dog just died and my car did too,
I just got fired and the rent is due.
You broke my heart so now I have to kill you,
I'll go downtown, and buy a gun, and that's what I'll do
You broke my heart so now I have to kill you,
I'll go downtown, and buy a gun, and that's what I'll do
You put my stuff out on the lawn
My records melted in the sun
You broke my heart and you broke my nose.
You killed my cat and you burnt my clothes
So I'll go downtown and I'll buy me a gun
Walk around and have some fun
Smokin' crack and crackin' jokes
Shootin' junk and shootin' folks
You lost my money at the track
Found out you gave me the clap
Your daddy's gonna litigate
'cause you're sixteen and I'm twenty-eight
You broke my heart so now I have to kill you,
I'll go downtown, and buy a gun, and that's what I'll do
You broke my heart so now I have to kill you,
I'll go downtown, and buy a gun, and that's what I'll do
You drank my beer and did my drugs,
Infested my whole house with bugs
You gave my leather to another guy
I've got a gun and now you're gonna die
You broke my heart so now I have to kill you,
I'll go downtown, and buy a gun, and that's what I'll do

If you don't the woman you can easily lose
Oh, I had a love, a true love and I lost it
No one seems to understand about the pain that it cost me

I believe that I should know
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to make her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
Think it over

Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard
Oh, I had a love, it was a true love and I lost it
Now I'm suffering all this pain that the true love cost me

A woman's got to have it
I believe
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to let her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground

You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

Quinn Lemley,"I've posed for pictures with Iv'ry Soap,
I've petted stray dogs, and shied clear of dope
(I've petted stray dogs, and I never mope)*
My smile is brilliant, my glance is tender
But I'm noted most for my unspoiled gender


I've been made Miss Reingold, though I never touch beer,
(I've been named Miss Perseverance year after year,)*
And I'm the person to whom they say, ""Your sweet, My Dear.""
The only etchings I've seen have been behind glass,
And the closest I've been to a bar, is at ballet class.

Prim and proper, the girl who's never been cased,
I'm tired of being pure and not chased.
Like something that seeks it's level
I wanna go to the devil.

Refrain
I wanna be evil, I wanna spit tacks
I wanna be evil, and cheat at jacks 
I wanna be wicked, I wanna tell lies
I wanna be mean, and throw mud pies

I want to wake up in the morning
with that dark brown taste
I want to see some dissipation in my face 
I wanna be evil, I wanna be mad
But more that that I wanna be bad

I wanna be evil, and trump an ace, 
Just to see my partner's face.
I wanna be nasty, I wanna be cruel
I wanna be daring, I wanna shoot pool 

And in the theatre 
I want to change my seat
Just so I can step on 
Everybody's feet 

I wanna be evil, I wanna hurt flies 
I wanna sing songs like the guy who cries
I wanna be horrid, I wanna drink booze
(I want to be horrid, I want to make news)*
And whatever I've got I'm eager to lose

I wanna be evil, little evil me
Just as mean and evil as I can be

Quinn Lemley,"It's not 'cause I wouldn't
It's not 'cause I shouldn't
And you know that it's not 'cause I couldn't

Quinn Lemley,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Quinn Lemley,"I've got an island in the Pacific
And everything about it is terrific
I've got the sun to tan me, palms to fan me, and...
An occasional man

I love my island, it's very lazy
If I should ever leave it I'd be crazy
I've got papayas, peaches, sandy beaches, and...
An occasional man

When I go swimming, I am always dressed in style
'Cause I go swimming wearing just a great, big, smile

And in the cool of evening, it's a treasure
And when the hour grows later, what is greater than...

C'est si bon,

When they thrill to romance,
It means that itt's so good.

Because it's oh, so good.

Every kiss, dear,
Leads to only one thought,

For the rest of my days,
I will whisper this phrase,

Quinn Lemley,"Just heard of the Shorty George
Got word of the Shorty George
Seems that it's a kind of jig  
Named for someone about so big

He rambles around the town
Preambles around the town
Then stops on a crowded street 
'n beats his feet till his feet is beat

Watch him go! - and he can - 
Like a real- nach'-l man
High Stepper is Shorty George
Black pepper is Shorty George

He dances to pay the rent
And to see that you're solid sent
Mister can you spare a penny?
Lady can you spare a dime? 

He makes, I don't know how many
'Cause he's dancin' all the time. 
Popa's dressed up mighty sporty
Momma's snooz-in' in the shade

But while mommas's catchin' ""forty""
Shorty sees the rent is paid
Get hip to the Shorty George
Hop, skip to the ""Shorty George""

Directions are short and sweet
Beat your feet till your feet is beat
So catch-on to ""Shorty George"" 
And latch onto ""Shorty George""

""Shorty George"" is the dance to do.",The Shorty George [From You Were Never Lovelier]

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Take away my high hats
Take away my favorite tie
Take away my white spats
I'll still get by
But my walking stick
You simply must let that be
I mean you can't take that away from me

Without my walking stick, I'd go insane
Can't look my best, I'd feel undressed without my cane

Must have my walking stick 'cause it may rain
And when it pours, can't be outdoors without my cane

It would just be something I could never explain

Quintetto Vocale Italiano,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"

We can be Heroes, just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever

And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day

cenizas de portadas
con discos de Bovb Dylan
Quique Gonzalez - Ayer queme mi casa
By Walkerock

Ayer quemé mi casa
mi caja de cerillas
Si te preguntan di que no sabías nada
Hoy no me detendrán
Ayer quemé mi casa
Aún tengo en la retina
el humao de las llamas
mis páginas escritas
Ayer por la mañana
bajé a por gasolina
Despues quemé mi casa
por no quemar mi vida
Hoy no me detendrán
Puedo tratar de acariciar la luna
Puedo viajar lo lejos que soñé
Puedo volar sobre las nubes sucias
después de ver mi casa arder

""La escribí despues de que entraran los ladrones en mi casa de salitre, me robaron bastantes discos, una guitarra etc... habla de soltar lastre, de huir hacia delante, de la posibilidad de desprenderse de las cosas que ya no nos pertenecen.""",Ayer Quemé Mi Casa
Quique González,"Hay una calle que lleva tu nombre
En la ciudad del viento
Después de tanto tiempo
Me harté de esperarte y se cayó el letrero

Fin de temporada
Para todos los amantes de lo ajeno
Todos los teléfonos que esperan tu llamada
Están ardiendo

Soy veraneante accidental
En la ciudad del viento
Subo la montaña que se oculta
Tras el vuelo de tu falda

Tengo en la memoria la estructura
De los labios incorrectos
Y otra de las formas que aparecen
En los mapas que dibujas
Cuando te desnudas

En todos los lugares te encuentro
En todos los lugares
Me siento un habitante más
En la ciudad del viento

Hay una calle que lleva tu nombre
Pero no me acuerdo
Después de aquel invierno
Traté de encontrarte en los cafés del puerto

Fin de temporada
Para los cantantes y los camareros
Doblan las campanas y las caravanas
Salieron del pueblo

En todos los lugares te encuentro
En todos los lugares
Me siento un habitante más
En la ciudad del viento

Quique González,"Algo tendrían que contar las estaciones
Algo dirán las terminales de aeropuerto
Los bares donde nacieron
Cinco de nuestras canciones
Las noches en que tu chica te decía nunca más

Quedó algo de nosotros en esos lugares
En el lavabo de señoras y en el puerto
En la butaca del cine, en una boca de metro
Y en todas esas esquinas que solíamos doblar

Es una historia que se escribe en los portales
La breve intensidad de las primeras luces
Y los conserjes de noche cuidan de los hostales
Y todas las camareras que quisieron escuchar

Algo tendrían que contar los escalones
Con pantalones arrastrados por el suelo
Algo el asiento trasero que me ofrecía tu coche
Y el humo del cenicero que acabó por rebosar

Es una historia que se escribe en los portales
La breve intensidad de las primeras luces
Y los conserjes de noche cuidan de los hostales
Y todas las camareras que quisieron escuchar

Tú siempre estabas dispuesta
Es Domingo por la tarde
La suerte es una ramera de primera calidad
Y los conserjes de noche cuidan de los hostales
Y todas las camareras que quisieron escuchar

Es una historia que se escribe en las postales
Con la necesidad de madrugar los Lunes

Tú siempre estabas dispuesta
Es Domingo por la tarde

I've burned my fingers bad before I've seen myself through worse I'm sure
But just the same I'm really not ok

Oh how I wish that I could sleep
I try but won't just sink that deep
My fingers won't stop aching so tired yet awaken
Or should I let it all loose and just weep

I've been pacing up and down my floors I have lost all sense of time
I sometimes halt and ask myself if I'm about to loose my mind

And you find you just don't have a clue
And when things turn out to be not what they seemed

I was coming down in pieces you bet I was coming down
What goes up believe me surely must hit hard the ground
I was coming down in pieces yet I was sound enough to say
I'm the only one to blame, yeah, so get out of my damn f*ckin' way

I can't believe all the years that have passed since

But as the ways of fate would have it well in the end we sure did meet
I am a man so high on this feeling I feel like dancing in the streets

I'd hoped you somehow would have always known
Though I know I would let it show
I can't believe this is really happening
Please someone punch me and ask me what day we have today
What day we're having today

I'm sure that I would not reply coz I would not if I was dreaming

And then that gentle smile when your eyes meet mine

Oh, how I wished for all these years, how I've longed
How out of place all words will seem at times
It's like we don't need to talk at all

And there's one thing I've learned

You just got to live to see the sun go down on everyone
You just got to live to see that gentle smile and feel alive
You just got to live to see the moon arise and the stars in the sky
You just got to live to take the pain sometimes and to leave it all behind

The world still turns...
You just got to live...",You Just Got to Live
Quorthon,"Honestly I don't believe I've ever been this weary
My thinking is really tearing my whole inside outside and in
I wish I had the nerve to do just something firm about it
I'm sure I could live without it but now it seems that we begin

To toss an eye exchange a smile from miles apart it seems
And yet it's hard to tell what's really happing from dreams
Is it just that we've both thinking is this stuff for real
And what if in the midst of this all what if some would see

If this real it seems to me to be good ol' infatuation
What if I am wrong and mix the facts with my imagination
Knee deep in this mess no wonder I don't sleep too good at night
Yes still I've never felt more all right

Hey, were you looking my way or was I standing in the way
I'm like a moth hot for the flame I just can't help it

I've been thinking should you accept an invitation
Can't help this fascination and yet if you were here I'd freexe
I count the days 'til I'll see you again and wish you'll be there
And yet if you would come near again I'd get those jelly knees

So we toss an eye exchange a smile but we never move too close
And yet make sure to make it short we want no one to know
Can I help that I am wondering is this for real
Are you thinking much the same as I then you must feel like me
Until the two of us have come to terms with how to act from now on
We are gonna have to walk in quite wide circles 'round each other
Can not wait until the day when you and I decide
What to do 'til then I guess I'll be allright

Hey, were you...",Cherrybutt & Firefly

We run head long between the raindrops
And like the rats we jump the ship that sinks

Why does it always had to be someone something else in the way
Why do somebody always seem to be always on their way

I turn away from what I see I've found so much more inside me

Baby through the walls would stand
There was enough of cracks to let the rain come in
Maybe that's why I never held your hand
Because it all began where it all begins

You know it was a hard thing to do to forget when I always would see you
It's funny how we always seem to end up hurting someone when our day is through

You're speeding too fast for me now
You're leaving you were always lost somehow
It's like we always seemed to bet on different horses
Arriving as the other one would leave

I mean she fly on the outside but,
It's what's on the inside that counts, right?
Let's get it!

That girl don't walk like the rest of them, 
She don't step out of line because she's reppin' Him, 
Hair and her nails done right, 
But she had better look when you look at her life
she's unimpressed by things
Not desperatae for a man cuz she bows to a King
Past dudes coming at her on the Ave.
But she's transformed, got dope character to match
She walks it out with such class, 
And doesn't put her hope in what she knows won't last, 
So you won't catch her bent in the club

Can't remember the club
And she aint trying the club
And she aint trying to be a diva

But a Godly women is gorgeous

I see you work,

Glasses, bags in moderation
She aint a slave to the fashions
But she's still a model of the ligtht, 
Following what's right
Not a slave to her passions
Home girl, so thorough
Her steps male it obvious, 
She's not of this world.
She dont chase temporary pleasure
the moment looks good, 
But eternity is better.

She has no problem being anonymous, 
Knowing that God is glorifierd through her accomplishments
She stays shining, not hot in it.
Non-stop!
Cuz she knows who she riding with
Shorty from the block but she liberaeted
Ex-diva
Now she's on that brand new life
So she's proud as sheep

They say, I'm built a little different, 
My shine a little brighter
The way my smile glistens,
Means I made it through the fire
And I appreciate all the dudes that paved the way, 
Cause iron sharpens iron, 
Now I'm sharper on my game
They say behind a good man
Stands a great woman
But I wouldn't be great
If my man wasn''t human
He's taught me hoy to pray, 
Bea a pillar in my home
Yo, my baby girl is coming
So I gotta let then know, 
It's more than being pretty

It's about a humble heart

Ain't no one ever made it back from where I'm from

Had to get a nine to five but that's when I was the brokest

Started doing talent shows hoping that somebody noticed

Finally finally finally I get to put the past behind me-hind me

No have to struggle anymore

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone

Cuff her booty while we dance and she don't mind
And pickin' her up is obsolete
Because I see her at the club valeting her Jeep

She can turn a man into a mouse in a minute
Snappin' her fingers up and down and make you cool with it
Walkin' away, hummin' her favorite song
Ain't nothin' but the rip going on

We will be together for all times

But she pages me to go bowlin'
But not quite the kind of balls that you're thinkin'

And so I sniggle as I reach into the pocket of my shorts
Showin' straight cash as I watch 'em clear the court

And the one I lost
When it comes down to her
Thinkin' about what my mother's done for me
The love she's given me
Makes it easy to do  a song like this
So this one's for you ma
I love you

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me
Boy hurry to Sunday school

Filled with the long of glory
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh Sadie
Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie
Place no one above you sweet Sadie
Well well well (living in the past)

Sometimes it seems so funny
No money can turn your life around
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papas' old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry

Sometimes she'd be so happy
Being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Oh Sadie maiden
She's loving my song in a special way
Well, well, well
Sweet Sadie
Living in the past

Oh she's never sinning
In love she's always winning yeah
My my my my my
I love you mama

I just can't forget
How you gave me love, oh no
If there's a Heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love
It's a mean world without you
And I surely miss you much mother

And now that you're gone
I'm gonna carry on
'Cause your're cryin' lady, woah Sadie

These summers, goes and I won't call them, hoes

'Cause in the 90's you gotta respect the ladies
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie
That's how you get your true mock on but
Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song

Hey don't I know you from somewhere?
Can we go somewhere to be alone?
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks make their heads bob
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny

Summer bunnies drive me crazy (you know you drive me crazy)

So beep, beep, beep it's time for me to make a move
I'm on my way to his picnic
Ay, Joa we got time to go and start this shit, yeah
But I wanna be early, fool
So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in just like the old school
Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery
The sun's blazin', the day is feelin' good to me
I can just smell the funky beats
You know the flavor in between the sheets

I saw my boy Big Al, said Just keep it straight
He said, I know I got a novelty to validate
So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb?
He said, no my brother, you got to get your own, summer bunny

This party is packed tops, word to the mother
I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother
And wine coolers is what I'm packin'
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jackin'
Jackin' fools for their bunnies
'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y they wanna get with me
And the PAs in the house (so what up?)
So check, check, check it out
My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on
Some soul food, cool Aid and you know it's on
Then after that I hate to eat and run but I'm outty

Smokin' blunts on the veranda with Amanda
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said
Poppa doin' this, Poppa doin' that
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my Jeep might get wetted
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran
Y'all stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs
Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets
You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals
I made you, why would I play you?
Think about it while the streets you roam
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home

You to have the best of things

Are you ready for me?
Before I start, I just wanna get a few things off my chest.
(Take ya time brother)
You see, being in the business that I am in, looks like everything I do,
Everywhere I go, and everything I see,
Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glass-yes- Can I talk about it?
(Talk on,talk on)
While you're looking I suggest you take a good look'
And I hope you find just what it is you're looking for 
(Amen)

Just like that song says- ain't nobody's business what I do
Now can I move on?
(Move on, move on, move on brother Kelly)
I remember when I was trying to be somebody, but I just didn't know nobody
(I didn't know nobody)
But now
(Now)
I said now
(Now)
Can I say it again?
(Gon' and say it again)
Now, every since God has blessed me, it seems that things are going a little 
Bit different(yes it is)

Folks ain't it funny how things can say sometimes,why,even the Statue of 
Liberty want some bump and grind
Can I getta witness off up in them jeeps (Amen)
I don't see nothing wrong with a little truth
Now-now, wait a minute, go that way
Ya see the good book says that the truth is the light,please, I think it's time 
To turn on your lights and see the truth
Can, Can I talk on?
You don't know where I've been, you don't know where I'm going, You don't know 
What I do.

Can I get a witness?
So before you go trying to pass judgment on me, pass judgment on yourself, 
Worry bout yourself, and what yourself is doing, and where yourself is going, 
And who yourself has been with 
That way, you

Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

Partied in every club nothing but VIP
I never take for granted these luxuries I have
Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask

Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf

But by the look upon your face you had already discerned
You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay
But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away

Okay you, you're saying you came in and
And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that

And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit
Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn)

On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife

So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf
Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be dropped off

Comes back on around and back on around
And back on around again, yes it does

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
In a state of shock that's what it left me
Take it from a man who knows
That three ain't company
No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself

Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house

Chillin' at the house on the hill
You gotta say my my my like Johnny Gill
Hey, rich girl, poor girl get the same respect
You can all drink for free and call Earl collect
At the moment of truth with burden of proof
We stack so you can spread love like I chose
The lyrical genius with the R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof we sets on fire
But as long as the party is jumpin, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody who was somebody was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year
Yeah, ay yo, come on

Baguettes on the wrist, it's just for shine
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind
Baby it's all good so dance tonight

Girl there's a party goin' on
My temperature's warm
So let me freak you through the floor
While the bass is bumpin'
All night if your body can handle

All we want is a party
A reason to celebrate
Now that we got the money, oh yeah
We dance the night away
Nothing but the hands up

R. Kelly,"How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands

There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you
(If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you
(If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you
(If I could turn back the hands)

(If I could turn back)
That would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands)

I'm going down, yes I am
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands)

(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
Love you love you love you

I do all this for you
You contemplating on me
Or is it him
Or is it me
Or is it him
He told you he'd be there for you
And he wasn't
I told you I'd be there for you
And I was
And still is the real is
Who takes care of biz
Took you from apartments
And got you home like The Wiz
I'm not the kind of guy
To give you everything
But if you're real then
You can get some ice in your rings
You and me straight to the crib
Off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us
It really don't matter
Who's first in the shower
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour
And when it comes down to the dollar
You can have it
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit
Friends come around don't be ready to change
Treat me like a stepchild when I'm up on my game
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name

Ooh baby, I want you here with me
And give you everything
That your heart desires
Lady can you feel me
Do you wanna be with me for always
Baby can't you see
What you do to me
when he do the things that he has done to you baby

[Chorus]
You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
Cause I can do those things if I'm wit you, baby

Now who took you in when that nigga put you out
And who picked you up when that nigga put you down
Restraining orders keep that fool from around
Had to set you up in a spot downtown
See I was the one who was there for you
But I'm not the one that's gonna play the two
Channel bags in the trunk what you gon' do
You could treat the future like a menu
As long as I'm the only one to bend you
And when you wanna take a flight I'm the one to send you
Never be the one that's out to hurt you
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you

But first we must dance

Private cotillion style
One lady's fantasy
Trip to Milan tonight
Exclusive shopping spree

Mansions await, your scent
That smells just like treasure
Dining with me in suites
That overlooks the shore

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Dancin' with a rich man
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance?
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Dancin' with a rich man
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

Kissing the feet of you
While listening to bonsais
And your angelic grace
Wearing Victoria

Passionate love with you
Hearing you, ""Oh, oui oui""
Some antique jewelry from
Kenshire’s gallery

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Dancin' with a rich man
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance?
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Dancin' with a rich man
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

And when you'll elevate
Like visions of grandeur
Mademoiselle and me
Behind the villa doors

Sunsets on yellow sand
That’s where we rendezvous
Chapels of Valentine
Is just to name a few

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Dancin' with a rich man
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Dancin' with a rich man
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Dancin' with a rich man
As we move, then we touch, then we dip

Yo, for those who live the way that I live
We came a long way
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL
It's Nas and R. Kell

I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels
But all she wanted was some love and affection
But all I did all the time was neglect
The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey
I used to talk about how I was gonna get us out of the hood
But as long as we're together as a family, then it's all good

[Chorus]
Because any man can make a baby
But it takes a real man to be a father
Talking 'bout a family, the kid, you and me
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
You see love is wrong and love is right
But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking 'bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality

Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk
And your truth sound absurd so my pride just let you walk
When all the time knowing that I didn't mean
To hollar out and call you bitch and tell you leave
I admit it, I was wrong but now it's over come on home
I can't take it here is where you belong
Even out the window looking for the mailman
I hope he's got a letter says, I'm missing you, in the mail
And then I saw you with another, made it hard for me to breathe
But when I played the game for gives
I should've played the game for keeps

Now I wore the shoes that you talked about in your song
But it's been a change I've got a new pair on, yes

Ghetto prone federal Jay-Z shake the dice let 'em go
Better know I tear down every show better known cheddar prone
Like the chrome big Rolls say it y'all all I need is four bars
I'm hotter than a lot of men switch up cars like Rodman's hair color
And hit your broad I'm borderline too much for the mortal mind
Every time you order me wine finder's mortify now pop that cork then pour the wine
Represent New York to Chitown like what floss mine like of course mine what
Never cross my family can we all get along hell no I'm tryin' to tell y'all
Here it is that rule that biz got your baby daddy but Jay-Z true that is
Better school that kid on whose shoes that is or who I be nigga V-I-P jigga

Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan

Despacito",What I Feel/Issues
R. Kelly,"I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying ""damn"" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it)

Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell, the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah (ooh, yeah)
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too, too many times
Now I can't come around 

'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's just like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it)

Oh yeah, oh yeah, la la da da
La
La da da da da
La da da da da
La
Oh yeah, la da da da da
La
Oh, ah, listen, if you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays

When a woman's fed up
Mama taught me along time ago 
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
Then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it)

Yeah
You can cry a river
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her
Hey woman, if you're listening
Said I miss you baby, whoa, whoa, oh yeah",When a Woman's Fed Up
R. Kelly,"I'm sick and tired of the games you played
Every move I make your ass got something to say
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Everybody is trying to figure me out

What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life
I can't go one day without y'all in my face
y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say
Cops chase me when I'm standing still

You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills
And you cut me down 'cause I keep it real
Sometimes I want to fly far away from here
To another place it ain't worth these tears

Sometimes at night when I close my eyes
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust

See I work so hard just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out

If yo had your way it'd be lock and key
Everywhere I go trouble follows me
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind

Forgive me father for I have sinned
When was your last confession

His true fears he left without a care
And that was more than I could bare
When you need my help I never tell you no
When I need your love you got somewhere to go
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick
I get mad as hell but that's ok
Kick off these shoes 'cause I'm here to stay
I gotta let you know got no time to play
So feel me and all that you hear me say
What I'm building up you can't tear it down
'cause it's built on solid Rockland ground
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky
Nothing in my view, hey I can fly
y'all just hate, I can't take no more
And if you feel me raise your hand and show

This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south
Southside tell me can you feel me
Feel me, feel me",What I Feel

R. Kelly,"Chilling in my four point six at the light 
Bout to be VIP for the night 
Shorty in the drop top V made a right 
Pull up to her bumper baby, beeped twice 
Jumped out the whip like I was the police 
Didn't have a gun, but my wrist said freeze 
Got Friday on a DVD 
She's a baller and I'm a baller 
What?

To all my hot girls 
Livin' fiesta 
To all my hot boys 
Livin' fiesta 
To all my Chi town niggas

And all my uptown niggas 
Fiesta 
To all my players and my hustlers 
Fiesta 
And if you sittin' on them blades 
Fiesta 
To all my honeys in the club 
Fiesta 
And if you rollin' with a thug 
Fiesta 

We be off in the club sippin lot 
Red eye deep in the club puffin' Lye 
Strippers in the back of the club showing live 
Soon as I get a buzz I'm showing out 
House on top of the hill 
Counting what? 
Whose gonna buy the bar? 
Got enough 
Take the haters out in the back, rough 'em up 
I'm a baller now where's my ballers? 
What? 

[Chorus]

We pop Cris on a daily base 
Plus we got honeys all up in the place 
Bout to wild out in a major way 
So put your hands up if you made your pay 
Add a little juice to the Tangaray 
But let the ice show till the diamond fades 
Rockland sittin' on Capitol Hill 
Trackmaster make capital deals 

[Gotti] 
Now look at Gotti iced out with the blingy-bling 
And a big body sittin' on them gleamy things 
Now Rockland niggas know the means of cream 
Kelly, R&B Thug and it sings to king 
Got PJ niggas in caprime green

Hot chicks down to do anything 
Cop them mo chicks 
Cop mo bricks, pop mo Cris 
Hey Kelly drop mo hits

What you know about them cats 
That be spendin' the dough 
Every day drink Henney and a bottle of Mo' 
Ride whips, hittin' chicks 
Blowin' twenties on drough 
To the club thirty deep 
Plenty of ice to show 
Mami say she never rolled in a six before

Never seen a young cat this rich before

R. Kelly,"From beyond this bed of mine I see
Ceiling fans with you on top of me
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun
And all you secret fantasies thy will be done (done)
And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn

If we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because
Of the greatest

The greatest you
The greatest me
We have found the greatest chemistry
The greatest touch 
The greatest kiss
What came to be is the greatest wish
The greatest show
The greatest song
The greatest words
The greatest all night long 
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
This is the best sex I've ever had

I know twelve ways to make your love come down
And the secret places on you will be found
Like a voyage when the storm begins to roar 
There's no telling what this night could have in store (in store)
Cause inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn

And if we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because
Of the greatest

R. Kelly,"[Chorus]
I decided to stay home tonight
I decided I'ma treat you right
I decided to be there for you
Decided to be on my P's and Q's
I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'ma take you out weekends
Decided to give you a reason to trust
These are decisions that I make for love

Enough is enough no more running around
(Searchin' for what's right here at home)
Because my luck is 'bout to turn around
(And I just can't keep doin' you wrong)
Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always
(Tired of this ego trip)
'Cause soon you'll be searchin' for another man
And I just can't have that happen to me

[Chorus]


Now I've had about all that I can stand no more
(I'm turnin' in my playa's card)
See I'm retirin' from the secret life I chose
(Cause I just can't keep breakin' your heart)
It was silly of me to be the way that I was
(First was blind, but now I see)
Baby, soon you'll be sayin' I'm fallin' out of love
And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When tha morning comes, you see the sun will shine on you and me
Was on my way to losin' you, until' I found reality
So cast away your doubts and fears, cause from now on I'll be right here
For always
Forever more, I decided

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Girl I'm going to dump my friends
Yes I will
Truly I will
We are going to be together on the weekend
Whoa, whoa
See these are the decisions I made for love
For the two of us

Now I was supposed to be a man about it
Should of never left your side

That push me to say things I don't wanna say
You know what I'm saying?
You know I love you
You know I care about you
This time, you just brought it on yourself
Yo, check it out

Now I shoulda been more man
About the way things went down
Especially since we been dealin'
For like seven years now
I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down
No conversation, no good sex in a while
But still you search and find a way
To love me somehow
Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow

Running around here talking about
How I'm a big player now
Hidden in corners, blinging out our share
Kelly makin' hits now
Thinking about this industry
And how I put it out
You were there for me
When I used dish rags for ties
There's times that I didn't hear you
I was talkin' too loud
When I didn't come home
I was hanging with the crowd
Whenever we fight I try to win every round
Can you find a way to forgive me now

(I don't mean it) Cuz I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you

[Priest]What do you need from me?
[R.] I broke up with my girl and I'm feelin' kinda lonely
[Priest]I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly
You been so demanding
You need to read my word, son
And get some understanding

[Priest]Stop making excuses
Recognize the love she gives
And try not to abuse it

That will make her mine

(I don't mean it) Believe me I pay the price
(I don't mean it) When I was down and out
(I don't mean it) You reached out your hand

R. Kelly,"I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America!

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Standing here throwing them songs at me
Somebody pray for me

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me

R. Kelly,"I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin'

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa

Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh

We're almost at the peak
Cause I'm feeling tingly

Now flew your body like, what (what, what)
It's like diamonds with the cut (cut, cut)
The hottest out of your friends
The way you take it from me
Girl you put it on me like draws
Moaning when you talk
I'm about to tear your shit out

After the party it's the hotel lobby and
After the Belve' then it's probably Cris'
And after the original it's probably this (fiesta)
Yes ma, Bed-Stuy, fiesta
Remix with the homie from the Midwest side
Game recognize game, hoes do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I suppose you knew
So thugs, pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsche's
Boxes with glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' 'til six in the mornin'

In the back of the club with ma-ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma-ma
Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'm a be drinkin' 'til the early liz-ight (that's right)
Nigga high like a muh'fuckin ki-zite
Take three honies just to make me feel ri-zight
My, my, my, my
It's what they all say when they see the frozen ice
They say my, my, my, my
Anytime they see them big things only cause I

While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' ""Kelly have you seen her?""
Yeah she wit me on the low
Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'

Switchin' lanes in my Six, in the 'burbs
I met a broad named Tasha, in the 'burbs
Took the hood then I moved it, to the 'burbs
Now no more sheriffs or polices, in the 'burbs (that's right)
And we about to tear this club up
Don't worry 'bout expenses cause I got that sho' 'nough
Ready to BOO like I'm fresh outta jizzail
I need some WOO from all the honey's on the DL
I said my, my, my, my (yeah)
It's what them thugs yellin' when the strippers on fizzles
They say my, my, my, my (yeah)
Got Kisha yellin' from that up and down sizzle

While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' ""Kelly have you seen her?""
Yeah she wit me on the low
Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'

I put the big body up, come through in a Rover
Not only Kelly and Gotti, it's Boo and Hova
Pop Cris if you like, my ice glist' in the light
I'm wit Roc-Land right, so I'm rich for life
I'm like Heaven, everybody wanna get to me
How you make it to the gates and forget the key?
I'm the one God chose so you blessed through me
Gotti Floyd getchu higher than that ecstasy

Hey yo I come through stunnin',
Plus I'm gettin' blunted in the new six-hundred with the big rims on it
We rock rocks that'll light ya shoulders
Gotta lotta hot cars but the drops is colder (ah)
You see V-I-P me, Kelly, Gotti, and Hov'
Drinkin' Cris' like its H-2-O
All we do is spend cheese cause we love the dough
Mami roll more trees before it's time to go

If you got cash money then you feel this shit
And if you rollin' on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you'se a motherfuckin' thug then you feel this shit
If you smokin' on some 'dro then you feel this shit
And if you off that ecstasy you got's to feel this shit
If you sippin' on some Cris' you got's to feel this shit
And if you throwin' up and shit, you got's to feel this shit

R. Kelly,"I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ghetto America

Rollin' through the hood, just stopped by to say, what's up
And let you know your baby boy ain't doin' so tough
Even though you passed, goin' on four long years
Still wakin' up late at night cryin' tears

Just thinkin' about those days you used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember, we'd brag on how rich we would be
To get out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody is sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to kick it on the front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
With you
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now, I'm just missing you

How I wish, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know, I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

And if I make it out, this thug life
See you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Ever since this money come, it's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, boy, you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness

Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin' this real shit off like a gun
I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a Bentley and a house

That's why fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass players get a real player hatin 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof until my shit is goin' down

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody is sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
And how I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends
With you
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me

And if I make it out this thug life
See you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head been tellin' me to come to church
Say, the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreamin' of windows, black-tinted like a hearse
But wakin' up to life sometimes seems worse

And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world, I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to street perform on Friday
With you
And how I'd go to church on Easter Sunday
With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

R. Kelly,"I'm just bein' real, you know
I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth

(Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't want to let me live

When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah

I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the kid with his paper a pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memory
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine

(Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you want to see me fail
(Fo' real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(Fo' real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held

They turn they backs on you, who was there believin'
Who said your troubles were only for a season
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out

Heaven, I need a hug

So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me and lift me up (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Man, I tell you it's enough to make you want to give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another
And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what want to see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight
Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired
Have dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive

(Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me

And as for robbin', here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
Media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out

I knew something was funny when she stopped paging
House, cars, shopping malls
Man I tell you it's a battle call
Like a raging bull I'm about to charge you

It's time to put an end to your late night creeps
Now any last words before my pistol speaks

Mr. Biggs, now no disrespect but man I'm tired
Cause all these years it's my back you been riding
We been in and out of fights on these videos
Now it's about time you felt the real rodeo
See I dated Lila 98 of September 
You took her from me, yeah right you don't remember
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera
How clever you were when you slipped her your number
Ooh, I know that makes y'all want to know
Ooh, who's really on the down low
You wonder why we're always at it, there it is
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs cause I'm about to get
Wild Wild West sick and tired of your mess
You put me to the test and now I'm sticking out my chest
So any last words before I draw these cannons
Cause when the smoke clears I'll be the last man standing at the

When I'm rolling through your city
Show me love
And ladies when you see a boy
Give me love
And though I'm not conceited (right)
Its just my space sometimes I need it (right)

That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja lets break bread together
Pray together

Help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together
Lets cry together

Then together we'll make it better

Now, what gave you the silly idea that I'm about to leave
Girl who you been listening to? They must be crazy
Look back and see our past and all the shit that we been through
I'll be damned if I'm gon let this bullcrap take me away from you 
Cause I vow to give my all and girl I'm a man of my words
And on that word, I'll stand tall
Being without you sounds absurd
So dry your weeping eyes
Cause I'll be here by your side
No need to doubt the sky
I'm in this for the long ride

I will never leave, no 
You don't have to worry
Girl I will be right there for you
I will never leave, no
Baby can't you see 
I was born to be with you
I will never leave, no
God put us together
Nothing can take that away
I will never leave you no
Now until forever, be with you the rest of my days

You never have to question the love I have for you
Girl I will put my life on bended knees for you
Ask all my friends, they'll tell you
Your all I talk about
Even when I go to sleep your the only one I dream about
See I'm your picture girl and baby you are my frame
And that's why I know our love will stay the same
So dry your weeping eyes
Girl I'm by your side
Just trust me I'm that guy
I'm in it for the long ride

Since that the day the doctor took me out of the womb and spanked me
Girl I was born to be with you and the rest is history
Generations and now I'm all grown up and you carry my seed
Now we are flesh and blood
With you I am in love
For the rest of my life 
For the rest of my life

Bells ringing a full orchestra

The oceans calm and the rivers flowing
It feels so good, keep on going.
			
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads,as we make love
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads, as we make love
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.
		
Can you see the flowers blooming,slowly as the seasons change,
The gift of joy is found in when I softly here you call my name
Rose pedals, and all these oils, surrounded by a hundred candles,
The eagle delivers a letter, that says this night will last forever.
		
Damper than the morning dew,the night has chosen me and you
And girl I promise to make everyone of your fantasies come tru

We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads, as we make love
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.

Through all the trees, the smooth wind blows,then suddenly a rainbow
An ocean filled with white sail boats and huge waterfalls that overflow

Where the land cry's joyful tears,

See I did it back in 98 of September 
You took her from me yea right you don't remember 
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera 
How clever you were when you slipped her your number 
(ooh) I know that makes y'all wanna know 
(ooh) Who's really on the down low 
You wonder why we're always at it there it is 
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs 
Cause I'm about to get, wild, wild, west 
Sick and tired of your mess 
You put me to the test 
And now I'm sticking out my chest 
So any last words before I draw these cannons

Now Proverbs 18 verse 22 says
Standin' by the wife defines a good thing
Lyin' by her side thinkin' of you
I got to get up, go to the toilet
Wash my face, and clear my head
I gotta take you to a broad way show

'Cause I don't wanna go by self
I'm like a kid wit' two ice creams, baby
And I don't want either one to melt
Cause ever since I heard you speak in that interview
It is an awful feelin' if I hurt her
Then some day you gonna hurt me too

My heart stopped said what is this just
As soon as you started talking
Something happened deep within me (well)
All of a sudden I got this feeling
A chill came from feet to head and then I
Turned away from you and said to myself
This is not supposed to happen brother you've been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell

You made me love you

Made me love you babe, (said it wasn't in my plans) made me love you babe
Ooh, look at you

Said you must be one of the top models
Body curved like a pop bottle
Got me sweating like a boxer baby
I done stumbled up on a perfect lady 
Could this be what heaven sent to me
An angel come to set me free
Love has been a stranger to me
And myself keeps telling me that
This is not supposed to happen brother you've been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell

You made me love you
You made me love you babe, (oh yes) made me love you babe

Are 10 billion wonders to me (like the moon and stars above)
There's a whole new world for my eyes to see (yes sir)

Well, I don't know my damn self

Now what the hell does thoia thoing mean?
It can mean anything you want it to mean
Anything you say it mean, that's what it means
If you say sex? then probably
Some say it means pushin' a lex, then probably
This one white chick said gettin' real smokey and feelin' free
This black chick said sippin' Hennessy in V.I.P.
Well, well, you can say what you want, that's what it is
All I know is that the thoia thoing man its the sh*t
Afro's, cornrow's, hair weave's you gotta love it
White, black, brown, even Japanese, you gotta love it
And you know somebody out there goin', ""man I like the beat
The hook is real tight, but I'm a keep it real, dog, it puzzles me""
No rules in this music industry (y'all know!)
If it feel good and make ya move your feel (y'all know!)
And if the bass is bumpin' in your jeep (y'all know!)
That it's the piper and I'm comin' with the heat

Make you get like beyonce' and do the booty hop

Huh I remember when me and my brothers
We used to sit up on the porch in the
Summertime and just talk about just making it
You know what I'm saying being successful
Following up our dreams you know and I
I believe that's every kids dream
You know what I'm saying to rise and
Be somebody but damn!
Sometimes we just get caught up

I ain't got no money
And I ain't got no friends
Looks like my world is coming to an end
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
No shoes on my feet and
I just bearly got a used Cadillac

But somehow it's gotta change yeah

So I took this remix and

'Cause we all need it,
Can't live without it

Ghetto fabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous
If you wanna test raffishness for the respect
S.T.R.I.N.G.S. Yes. (oh yeah)
Fuck the rest give me the best
Why should I have to settle for less
When I could push the V-12's with finesse
(scratching) and all that mess
If you try to hold me back
Would I keep on struggling till I hit the sky.
Even if you wanted to you can't deny
Gotta feed baby girl who would die

We keep talking about escalating
Well who's gonna go first
Guess I'll be the one to step up
If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Every time something goes down
Somebody's crying ghetto tears
Hope I'm not raining on your parade
But this is not what keeping it really is
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah!
Ghetto for ya,
So I took this remix and rearranged

Check it out
Now motherfucker wanna act surprised
'Cause you're afraid to change scared to rise
That's why you ass get left behind
They got a sight, they got a mind
'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream
Talk that shit, block my cream
Negativity you gotta let go
Heaven gotta see for the ghetto

We all need hey hey hey
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah
Calling on heaven
Send your love down, to the ghetto yeah
Talking about a land where oh yeah
Where there will be no more crying,

R. Kelly,"Girl you just don't know 
Last night was incredible. Listen. Check it out. 

Last night, I felt the skies open up and rain down heaven
Last night, I felt the sun, the moon and the stars come together
Last night, I heard an angel speak to me he said us forever
And while we were making love, I saw visions of a tropical river

Last night I 
Touched a dream
When you were here with me
Last night I 
Touched a dream
Girl you fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
Said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Last night you brought my dreams to reality

Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings
Last night, I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing
Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony
While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free 

Last night I 
Touched a dream
You were here with me
Last night I 
Touched a dream
And you fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
I said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Ooh yeah, girl you brought my dreams to reality

After the rain comes the rainbow
The sun will shine after the storm 
Oh yes it will and Mother Nature guarantees
Jumped the mountain and touched the sky
Over the sea baby we can fly 
When we made love I see the flowers the trees the birds the bees

Last night I touched a dream girl
Touched a dream
You right here with me
Touched a dream
Ohhh ohh oooh a dream
Touched a dream

Touched a dream
Forever I have a dream 
A vision of you right there with me
I know you're my love making queen 
Touched a dream
And I am your love making king
Let no man or woman come between 
What God has given you and me
Touched a dream
The laws of reciprocity 
And give those amorocity 
Provided us with food to eat
Touched a dream
Fills our vacancies but together the perfect chemistry 
Forever anniversaries
Touched a dream
You're the root to my tree, I'm a branch you're a leaf
The apple carrying my seed
Touched a dream
Fall, winter, summer, spring
That's why I ain't gon' let the devil steal my joy from me cause I done

In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking

Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward that's the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this

Superstar honey, so mean and vicious
Got a lot in common, I'm so mean and vicious
Bark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer (preach!)

As I punch 170 on stretch roads

So any gunplay, that is an option

Rockin' Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
To try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter

And something just didn't sound right
And so I'm calling you back to check on you
How you holding up?

Oh everything is fine

You know I don't believe you

Whatcha saying? You think I'm lying?

I'm not saying it, but I know you

How you know me?

Cause you're my brother
And therefore I can tell
When something is troubling you

OK OK, I give you that
Nothing's wrong, I take that back
There is something on my mind
But sis, I don't want to waste your time

But I done told you time and time again
Whatever you're going through
You can come and talk to me
And I will say a prayer with you

But I done prayed and prayed night and day
I still can't seem to find my way

Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you
That you're washed up and you're through
But sister's here to let you know
Boy you're gonna make it through

Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again

Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins

Can you tell me what to do?

Well first you gotta believe the truth

Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him

That's okay because he believes in you

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us (and I believe yeah)
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to (woah)
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)

So, so what you're saying is believe a little more?

Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door

What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive
Especially when trouble follows me

When we're keeping it real
Robert sometimes
Trouble can follow where you lead

Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I

Just wait, let me make a phone call

To who?

A prayer buddy of mine
She can help you tear down your walls

I don't want nobody in my business

She's a friend
And besides you need this

You know how church folk can be

Boy I'm your sister, trust in me

Mm

Now hold on

Maybe she's gone

No

Maybe we ought to just try...

Shh shh, hello, is Kim there?

Yes, I think she's around here somewhere
Hold on

Now you just let me do the talking

Mm hmm

Hello?

Hey girl, how you doing?

Hey Kelly

My little brother's on the line and needed advice from you

Ooh what can I do for you?
Hello?

Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you

Oh, well, I know you must be very busy
So I'm not going to mess around, nah
Just telling my sister how my life is upside down
And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time
Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?

Mm hmm, similar to what I used to go through

Really?

Yes, and sometimes I still do

Yeah?

See it doesn't matter who you are
Or where you're from
If you struggle, God will use you

Amen sister, what you're saying is so true
Rob are you there?

Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do

Yes but if you stand the truth
It will free you

Oh

Just stand strong

Stand strong

With your head held high

With your head held high

Said it wont be long
In time he will provide

Will he?

Yes he will

You just stay in the race

Just stay in the race

And keep on running

And down to the end

'Cause your day is coming

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through

He'll give you peace
In the midst of your storm

Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me

But he'll never leave you

No way

You just gotta hang on

Hang on

Robert say a prayer, keep your head
God will do just what he said

Finally I think I get it

Yes, that's it
That's the spirit

Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family
Way too young to endure such misery
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) at any given time
(He hit me) no reason at all
(He hit me) so so hard
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me
And I'd take up for him
She said that devil's a liar
And pray get rid of him
And now I'm going to school, hitting those books
I'm doing fine
He's out my life, I'm not confused

I was a freshman in college and uh
I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me and had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I brake down and cry 'cause
Everybody knows me, knows that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard
(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God
(English) so many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach
It was like he was talking to me
When he said I can do all things
In Christ that strengthens me
And for me that was enough
Now that I went from a D all the way to an A plus

Me and my wife had a few problems
We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in (oh yes it is)
We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way

But that's okay, 'cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
'Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you gotta do is take this family's life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, 'cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college
And man he's got his hands full (hallelujah)

R. Kelly,"I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now

Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now 
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight

You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me

Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em

But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and 
That's when I knew

You saved me [4x]

Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees

Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free

You saved me [4x]

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back 
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so 
I call my mama to calm my nerves

(mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone

You saved me [4x]

You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me

You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me

No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2 
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me

You saved me",U Saved Me

R. Kelly,"When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today
I think about his goodness and the wonderful things he's done
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away
And soon as I was about to fall you stepped right in on time
Picked me up, and let me know you had nothing but love for me
And those lonely nights when I thought that I gonna lose my mind (my mind)
Lord, You were my company

And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
I feel strength (when I think about you)
No pain (when I think about you)
And no rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
And raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you)
(When I think about you)

And in the midst of the storm you were the shelter in my life
Even though (I was doing wrong) and even though (I fell off)
No-one can help me out, the way you helped me whenever I was in need
When trouble was chasing, I was weak (mmm) you kept your hands on me
My God you sacrifised you life that I might live for eternity
Despite my faults, you heard my cry (yes you did) and forgave my inequity
No-one can understand, the way you understand when it comes to my heart
Lord you gave me a brand new start

And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength (when I think about you)
There is no pain (when I think about you)
No rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
Raise my hands (when I think about you)
And shout your name (when I think about you) Oh Lord
(When I think about you)

Listen
Even though your doubts will come (doubts will come)
Believe he gave his only son (all of the world) to all the world
He chose to love (oh, yes he did) so how can we not (how can we not) send our praises up

I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength, yeah (when I think about you)
There's no rain (when I think about you)
No more pain (when I think about you)
I get glad, ohh (when I think about you)
Then I raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you) oh I
(When I think about you)
I feel joy (when I think about you)
And peace (when I think about you)
Feel your presence (when I think about you)
Coming over me (when I think about you)
Then I start to fall, yeah (when I think about you)
Down to my knees (when I think about you)
And begin to pray (when I think about you) Lord help me

Then I see the light (when I think about you)
Startin' to shine right through (when I think about you)
It's a brand new day (when I think about you)

And all my fears are gone (when I think about you)
Away (when I think about you)

R. Kelly,"Seven o'clock in the morning 
And the rays from the sun wakes me 
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me 
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darlin"", from the bathroom 
Then she comes out and kisses me 
And to my surprise, she ain't you 

Now I've got this dumb look on my face 
Like, what have I done? 
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun? 
Must of lost the track of time 
Oh, what was on my mind? 
From the club, went to her home 
Didn't plan to stay that long 

Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes 
Searching for my car keys 
Tryin' to get on up out the door 
Then she streched her hands in front of it 
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy 
Said, ""Woman move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs 

""Shh, shh, quiet 
Hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"" 
""Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out 
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house 

Then he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says, ""Honey, I'm in the room""
He walks in there with a smile on his face 
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him 
And says, ""I've cooked and ran your bath water""
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar 

Throws her in the bed 
And start to snatchin' her clothes off 
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on? 
You're not gonna believe it 
But things get deeper as the story goes on 
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone 
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate 
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late 
He hopped up and said, ""There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet""

He walks in the bathroom 
And looks behind the door 
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch, say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain 
While she's biting her nails 
Then he walks back to the room 
Right now, I'm sweating like hell 
Checks under the bed 
Then opens the dresser 
He looks at the closet 
I pull out my Beretta 
He walks up to the closet 
He comes up to the closet 
Now he's at the closet 
Now he's opening the closet...",Trapped in the Closet [Chapter 1 of 5]

Tell a girl about K-town and the projects, downtown and all these places
Caught her starin' at the ice in my ear, she almost fainted when she saw these glaciers
Feel the words when I spit em in the mic, First I gotta get up with the mob in the light
Rollin' 40 deep to the club and I'm like, gotta see what I'm bout to fuck tonight
The party so live, and I'm bout to set it off for the 0-5
It's all good but I got the 4-5, and I found me a down ass hoe to ride
And she got a fat ol' ass that'll brighten up the room
Come let a West Side Nigga slide this dick off in yo womb, Uh huh
Put the dial on her booty make her lively, most likely, she think I'ma make her wifey
Got her hooked like nightly, she wanna bite me, when I come up in the room in a White-Tee

I want put you on the counter by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be makin' love like the restaurant was closed

Would you like that?
Tell me right now pretty, babe

Girl, you're in the kitchen, chillin' in your robe
I'm sayin' to myself, she better go, put on some clothes
Ticklin' and teasin', doin' that little dance

R. Kelly,"[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend
Oh what am I gonna do?
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I've been kicking it with your girlfriend

Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real
I should've been a man and told you a long time ago
Instead of stunning I should have broke it down and let you know
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind 
And I blame myself for wasting your time
Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me
But her body language kept on temping and teasing me
And plus she knew what she was doing when she did it anyway
I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay
Truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]

Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her
And how we get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to dislead you
At first I just wanted to please you
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again
Because I came between you and your best friend
I did not ask for this
It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed
And the truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm sorry again
Never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry again
But girl I love her
I'm sorry again
I never meant to make you cry, no
The first one out the closet

R. Kelly,"Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darlin"", from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise, she ain't you

Now I've got this dumb look on my face
Like, what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?
Lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long

Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, ""Woman move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs

""Shh, shh, quiet
Hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor""
""Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house

Then he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says, ""Honey, I'm in the room""
Walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him
And says, ""I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar

Throws her in the bed
And start to snatchin' her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it
But things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, ""There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet?

He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed
Then under the dresser
He looks at the closet
I pull out my Beretta
He walks up to the closet
He goes up to the closet
Now he's at the closet
Damn he's opening the closet?",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 1
R. Kelly,"Now he's staring at me like 
As if he was staring in the mirror 
She yells honey let me explain 
He says you don't have to go no further 
I can clearly see what's going on 
Behind my back, in my bed, in my home 
Then I said wait a minute now hold on 
I said Mister we can work this out 
She said honey don't lose control 
Tried to get him to calm down 
He says ho I should've known 
That you would go and do some bogus shit up in my house 
But the christian in me gave you the benefit of the doubt 
I said we need to resolve this 
And he stepped to me 
I'm like whoa 
There's a reason I'm in this closet 
He says yeah what are you talking ?clothes? 
I met this girl at the Pajis club 
And she told me she didn't have a man 
Then he said man please I'd kill you 
If you didn't have that gun in your hand 
And then I said but your chick chose me 
He said don't give me that mack shit please 
His phone goes off and then 
Things get a little more interesting 
He steps a little closer 
I point my gun and say I'm not the one you're after 
He says it's not my bet you didn't know my man 
Did she tell you I was a pastor? 
I said well good that's better right 
Why can't we handle this Christian like 
And I started to put the gun down 
Til I saw his face still had a frown 
She started crying saying baby I'm sorry 
Then he said baby not as sorry as you're gonna be 
I started inching out 
He says no I want you to see this 
Said I gotta get out this house 
He said not til I reveal my secret 
I'm like what is going on inside his head 
Then he takes his phone and calls somebody up and says 
Hello? 
(Hello?) 
Baby? 
(Yeah) 
Turn the car around 
(What's going on? What's wrong?) 
I just need for you to get right back here now 
Click

He looks at me and says 
Well, since we're all coming out the closet 
I'm not about to be the only one broken hearted 
She said what do you mean? 
He said just wait and see 
I said somebody better talk to me 
And then his phone rings 
He picks up 
And somebody says sweetheart I'm downstairs 
And he's like I'll buzz you up 
I'm on the fifth floor hurry take the stairs 
And I'm like who is this mystery lady that you're talking to 
He says in time you both will know the shocking truth 
Baby this is something I've been wanting to get off my chest for a long, long time 
Then I said I'm gon shoot you both if you don't say what's on your mind 
He says wait I hear somebody coming up the stairs 
And I'm looking at the door 
He says I think you better sit down in a chair 
I said I'm going to count to four 
One 
He says mister wait 
Two 
She says please don't shoot 
Three 
He says don't shoot me 
Four 
She screams 
Then a knock at the door 
The gun's in my hand 
He opens the door 
I'll be god fucked up like shit fuck it a man comin' to fuck me up and give me head fuck
He opens the door, I can't believe it's a man",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 2
R. Kelly,"Well, here we are the four of us,
in total shock me and her,
I close my mouth,and swallow spit, 
as I'm thinking to myself this is some deep shit,
then I said so your gonna tell me he's the one
you've been talking to,
he says yes, I says no, he says yes, I says no,
he says it's the truth,
I yell ""all of y'all asses crazy,
let me up out this door"", cause this is way
more than I bargained for, 
and then she says wait, 
I'm sure we can all fix this, then I said i'm late,
Cause I ain't got a damn thing to do with this

Then she said wouldn't you like to know 
just how it all begin,
then I thought to myself and said quick you got 3 minutes,
then it got real quiet
I said somebody start talking, then she said 
And then she said ""My God Ruphus, I got just one question, 
How could you do something like this i'm so hurt!
he looked at her and said bitch please you got
yo nerve, with all yo club poppin'
lying sayin' you was shoppin',
and now here you are in 
our home, and you calling
me wrong, she said ok you busted me,
and that much I agree,
you caught me cheating,
but this a little extreme,
he said you are my wife,
sleeping behind my back,
and now I come home and you got him in the closet,
how extreme is that?

She says but she's a he,
then he says please you can't judge me,
she says Ruphus this is crazy,
and I said stop arguing,
I did not stay here to hear y'all chew
each other out, so get to the point,
or I swear I'm out, excuse me please,
but I think I can explain what's going in
here, my name is Chuck, and I've been 
knowin' Ruphus for bout a year,
at midnight creeping around with him it's been a living hell,
sneaking in and out of hotels,
I said brother spare me 
the details, then Ruphus said Chuck please,
don't say nothin' else, then she screams Ruphus
you son of a bitch,
and he says Cathy go to hell,
I said I thought you name was Mary,
that's what you said at the party,
man this is getting scary,
I'm gonna shoot somebody

Then Ruphus starts yellin' and screaming
saying Cathy this is all yo fault,
she throws a pillow at him
and says you was creepin' too the only difference 
is you didn't get caught,
Chuck screams out we're in love
Cathy says love my ass
Ruphus say they gettin' married
then I shoot one in the air,
then I say not another one of 
you sons of bitches say a word,
cause all of this shit I'm going through
is unheard, grab my cellular,
sayin' this is so wrong,
call up my home,
and a man picks up the phone",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 3
R. Kelly,"Now I'm dashing home
Doing eighty five
Swerving lane to lane
Wit fire in my eyes
I got a million thoughts
going through my mind
I'm thinking about what I'ma do and who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind
And then I look in my rear view 
I cannot believe this
Damn, here comes a police man
He drove right up on me and flashed his light
Then I pulled over without thinking twice
He hopped out the car and walked over to me
And said license and registration please
I looked up at him and said
Officer, is there something wrong
He said no, except you were were doing eighty five in a sixty mile zone
Then I said officer
Let me explain please
Ya see the truth of the matter is
Is that I have an emergency
He said no excuses
And no exception
He flicks his cigarette and then he gives me the ticket
Said have a nice day and walked away
I said yeah right and drove away
Then I turned my radio on
And did fifty five all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway
Hopped out and slammed the car door
Then go in through the back
Bust up in the house and she screaming
Whats all that for
Then I'm like woman I called this house
And a man picked up my phone
Then she said calm down
Did you forget
My brother Twan came home
Oh,
And that's all I could say was oh
Wit a stupid look on my face
Said I forgot he came home today
And she said that's okay
Because honey I understand
She said you don't have to explain
Then I took her by the hand
I kissed her and then we went to the room
Then I turned some music on
Apologized one more time
Then went down and start getting it on
And she started biting her lip
Grabbing me and making noise
Now we making love and she's my ear whispering
It's all yours
I said I love you
And she said I love ya, too
Then a tear fell up out my eye
Then I called her my sunshine
And then she looked at me
And said baby go deeper please
And that's when I start going crazy
Like I was trying to give her a baby
The room feel like its spinning
We keep turning and turning
As if we were in a whirlwind
The way our toes are curlin
The next thing ya know, she starts going real wild
And starts screaming my name
Then I said baby, we must slow down
Before I bust a vessel in my brain
And she said please no don't stop
And I said I caught a cramp
And she said please keep on going
I said my leg is about to crack
Then she cries out
Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax
And I said cool
Climax
Just let go of my leg
She says you're the perfect lover
I said I cant go no further
Then I flip back the cover
Oh my God, a rubber",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 4

Well, well, well
What the fuck is this
A condom in my bed
Ya better start talking, bitch
'Fore I burn this mutherfucker down
I said you better start talking
Start talking right goddamn now
Then she said baby
I'm so speechless
Then I said my baby
You gone be breathless
If ya don't start talking quick
Woman, I'm gone have a fit
You don't know what ya fuckin wit
Girl ya better cut the bull shit
Now its obvious somebody has been all up in my home
In my bed, and plus I smell cigarettes
Now and sniffin and lookin around
Suspicious like someone's here
Then I looked in her eyes and in her eyes
There was so much fear
Pull out my gun said is he still here
She shook her head and said naw
I'm checkin behind every door
She cried out he left right after you called
I said what the fuck was you thinking
You thought that I wouldnt find this out
Then I said you must be crazy or on crack to have somebody off up in my motherfucking house
She hopped up and said thats enough
She said I cant take no more
And then she said you made your point
But now its time to even the score
She said I know all about last night
And where you went when you left the club
Said that's right, nigga I was there
Wit this guy in the back of the club
I said I thought you was wit yo girls
She said I thought you was wit yo guys
She said you was at that bitches house
And don't even try to act surprised
Said bab, she said shut up
Don't you say a word
It ain't nothing you can say
That I ain't already heard
Then I said woman, don't you try to turn it all around
Cause the fact still remains that someone else was in my house
Then she said you're right about that
Something did go down, but I don't have to turn it around
Cause what goes around comes back around
I'm moving a little closer to her
She's tripping over the furniture
She said wait first, just let me explain
I said no need to, just give me his name
And then she said
I say uh what
She said please sit down in a chair
And I say no, I'm standing up
And she cries out I'm so scared to tell you because of what ya might do
And I screamed look girl you better give me this man's name and I'm not playing with you
She says okay, wipes her nose and asks me about a girl named Tina
I thought to myself, said it sound familiar
I said I probably know her if I seen her
Then I say anyway girl, what the hell does that got to do with this man
She said he know my girl Roxanne
I said who the hell is Roxanne
Then she says Roxanne's a friend of mine who know with this guy named Chuck
Chuck's cool wit this guy name Rufus
And I'm sitting here like what the fuck
Then she says Rufus wife, Cathy
We both went to high school
She introduced me to
The policeman that stopped you",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 5
R. Kelly,"[Chorus]
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend
Oh what am I gonna do?
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend

Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real
I should've been a man and told you a long time ago
Instead of stunnin' I should have broke it down and let you know
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind
And I blame myself for wastin' your time
Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me
But her body language kept on tempin' and teasin' me
And plus she knew what she was doin' when she did it anyway
I knew what she was doin' too and that made it okay
Truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]

Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her
And how we get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to dislead you
At first I just wanted to please you
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again
Because I came between you and your best friend
I did not ask for this
It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed
And the truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]

I'm sorry again
Never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry again
But girl I love her
I'm sorry again
I never meant to make you cry, no
The first one out the closet

[Chorus: x2]",Kickin' It with You Girlfriend
R. Kelly,"I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' her eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to
Rollin like I supposed to
Shinin' like I supposed to
In the club, fuckin' wit' honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas tryin' to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm goin' holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt wit all y'all
Yeah, yeah homie u say she ya girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm be like cousin
Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them player-ette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch
'Cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

Hey homie, if you ain't gettin' no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig

Well if u love ya girl
And wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
'Cause I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I seen u girl
Better treat your girl right
'Cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
'Cause u leave your wife
And I see ya wife
That be for real
How long u think that's finna be ya wife
Well I'm livin the life
You just gettin' it right
Your old lady look at me
'Cause you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like u
'Cause you you the better type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see me dance
I noticed she was checkin' me
And diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that right
You know smack that thang
Sit that right
Upon that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair
Like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll settle just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'Cause u might catch me
Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt

We playing in my glam in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

When I, when I, when I,when I pull up to club
All the shawties be like (Damn 28's)
Then I be like girl u know just who I am (Don't hate)
See I done fell in love wit a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy Paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como si llama, lil' mama mi llamo pain, what is yo name
I'm feelin' yo vibe
And I'm hopin' you feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what u say
He's so fly
And he's so coo
Hey shawty (Hey shawty)
What it do
He mad 'cause I'm lookin' but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad 'cause (I'm a flirt)

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' her eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)

And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

It's the remix
Now if u walk up in the club with a bad chick and she lookin' at me
Then I'm gon hit
Man jackin' for chicks
I tried to quit
But I'm playa homie
So I had to hit
While you buyin' her drinks (In the club)
Actin' like you (In love)
Stunnin' like you (All thug)
We was (Switching numbers)
She lookin' at you when I walk by
You turn yo head, she wink her eye
I can't help if she checkin' for a platinum type of guy
She be callin' me daddy, and I be callin' her mommy
She be callin' you Kelly, when yo name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinkin'
When you bring 'em round me
Let me remind you that I am the king of r&b
Do you know what that means
That means if you love yo chick
Don't bring her to the VIP
'Cause I might leave wit yo chick
Just keepin' it real (My nigga)

See girl, only thing I'm trying to establish with you is not
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
Real talk
Just because your friend say she saw me at a club with some other bitches
Sitting in VIP, smoking and drinking and kicking it, tell me girl

Did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say there were other guys there?
Were there other guys there?
Well, tell me this

How the fuck she knew I was with them other girls then
When the whole club packed wait a minute let me finish what I've got to say
I've been with you five years and you listening to your motherfucking girlfriends
I don't know why you fuck with them all jealous no man havin' ass holes anyway
Real talk
Alway accusing me of some old bullshit when I'm just trying to have a good time

Don't you think I got enough bullshit on my mind
Real talk, hold, hold up
Didn't I just give you money to go get yours hair, toes and nails done the other day, hmm
Yeah your ass was smiling then
Real talk, oh
Gave who some damn money?
I ain't gave nobody no damn money girl?
Is you tweekin'?
You see what your problem is
You're always running of at the mouth telling your girls your motherfucking business, when
They don't eat with us, they don't sleep with us, besides
What they eat don't make us shit
Real talk
You call my mommas house and what?
Girl my momma ain't gotta screen no calls for me
Real talk, and watch your mouth
Fuck me? Girl fuck you!
I don't give a fuck about what you're talking about
I'm sick of this bullshit I'm coming home and getting my shit and gettin' tha fuck up out in a dodge
You ain't gotta worry about me no more
And the next time your ass get horny
Go fuck one of your funky ass friends
Hell yeah, you probably doing that shit anyway
You gonna burn what?
Bitch I wish you would burn my motherfucking clothes
With your triflin' ass, Milton, you bogus girl, Milton
Start your car up and get ready to take me home

See I just wanna help you make it right

R. Kelly,"(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man looking at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to
Shining like I supposed to
In the club, fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wondering why all these players trying to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gonna holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt with all of you
Yeah, yeah homie you say she's your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm gonna be like, ""cousin""
Believe me man, this is how them players do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff your bitch
'cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

Hey homie, if you ain't getting no money
you better keep her away from me your dig.

Well if you love you girl
And wanna keep you girl
Don't be walking up and asking me to meet you girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I've seen you girl
Better treat your girl right
'cause another man will
Better eat you girl like another man will
'cause you leave your wife
And I see you wife
That be for real
How long you think that's finna be you wife
Well I'm living the life
You just getting it right
Your old lady look at me
'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you
'cause you're the bitter type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light
I noticed she was checking me
And digging the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that price
You know smack that thing
Sit that right
Up on that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair
Like we getting in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll suit 'er just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt
The McLaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

(when I, when I, when I, when I) pull up to club
All the shawties be like (damn twenty-eight,eights)
Then I be like girl you know just who I am (don't hate, hate)
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper you all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como se llamas little mama? mi llamo pain, what is your name?
I'm feeling your vibe
And I'm hoping you feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
He's so fly
And yes, he's so cool
Hey shawty (hey shawty)
What it do
He's mad 'cause I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad 'cause (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)

It's the remix
Now if you walk up in the club
With a bad chick
And she's looking at me
Then I'm gonna hit
Man jacking for chicks
I tried to quit
But I'm player homie
So I had to hit
While you buying her drinks (in the club)
Acting like you (in love)
Stunting like you (all thug)
We was (switching numbers)
She looking at you when I walk by
you turn your head, she winks her eye
I can't help if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling me daddy, and I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly, when your name is Tommy
I don't know what you all be thinking
When you bring 'em round me (mane)
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B (mane)
Do you know what that means?
That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the v-i-p

Playas get lonely too... too... 

[Verse 1:] 
From, my iPhone to my sidekick 
Jet planes, schedule hectic 
My love life, I neglect it 
Had a fast car, but I wrecked it 
Plenty chances to fall in love man
So many weekends, I went to clubs man
In the fast lane, my life's a picture flick 
Let my drink decide, who is the next chick 
I ain't gone lie,all the blanck it matter to me 
She say she me love me, but it's just chit chatter to me 
But deep inside I was always missing something 
But I'm a thug so I'm always on something 
So many girls always drinking and having fun 
Life's a beauty shop and I keep my hair done 
Seem like I'm on a marry go ride 
Man it makes a thug wanna settle down,

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes 
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too...(oh I do) 
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

I wanna settle down with you 
Baby you and me 
A Life that's brand new 
Quit running these streets 
Take away your pain 
Chase away the rain 
Off my love game 
I might even change my name

Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too..(oh I do)

Uh, uh V.I.P. 
Uh, uh R.O.B 
Always in the spot light 
Living the good life 
All of that something still just ain't right 
Videos and all of these interviews 
When all I really want is to be next to you 
I spend more time with my cars now 
Land of the Hollywood sign, I'm a star now 
My life is more than the cars and awards 
It gets lonely and I can't ignore 
Always in the streets going hardcore 
I spend a couple of G's when I'm bored

Party lights mixed with lonely 
Nights mixed with birds grass 
Flights mixed with, 
Nobody to share it with 
Out of all the, after parties 
I still need somebody 
To be there when a playa's going through some shit 
To be there when a playa can't ever see...

Looking at your body, did you get a tan?
The way your body works from the touch of my hand
Thought you was a snake when I touched your skin, yeah

Enter, take it off, come here
Shawty, you're so soft

I'll be touching your skin
Kissing your skin, feeling your skin
Girl, I'll be touching your skin
Kissing your skin, feeling your skin

R. Kelly,"Seems like we're done here
Looks like that's everything
She walks by, one last time, 
Checks for her things and leave the keys behind
There will be more tears
As she's beginning to drive away
Its all clear now, there's no real reason to have the pain
Now I know love has kept me here, and my pride has kept me here
And hope keeps singing it's alright, I'll be fine

But she'll be going elsewhere
And she'll be lying else where
And she'll be wanted elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
And she'll be living elsewhere
And she'll be laughing elsewhere
And shell be happy elsewhere
And I'll be just fine without her, someday

That's what I keep telling myself

Was it the right thing
Was this our biggest mistake
Still call sometimes but she's got nothing to say, And still she stays away
It's got me questioning, if I ever meant the same to her
How could she, Why would she
Do these things put me through this pain now
If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad
That she don't think it's not worth a fight, she won't try

But she'll be trying elsewhere
And she'll be loving elsewhere
And she'll keep secrets elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
And shell be willing elsewhere
And shell be giving elsewhere
And she'll have feelings elsewhere
But hope keeps saying kells you can make it

But in the meantime I can't sleep I can't think
There's so many things in my head
Things she said, things that she meant
Things that I started feeling the day that she left
Things that I slept on
Things that I should have accepted
Things I expected and the things I neglected
I better get up off my ass
Get first flight out, and get her back

Or else

She'll be living elsewhere
And she'll be crying elsewhere
And shell be feeling elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
She'll be smiling elsewhere
And she'll be laughing elsewhere
Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere
That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight

Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child

Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm 'bout to handle my business then put that girl in my kitchen

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (uh, that's what I told her)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies
I can have you co-starrin' in one of my movies

Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexin'
Now I ain't got nothin' to do, tonight I got away for my crew
I just wanna put some in you and I can tell that you want it too

And I'm ready, babe and you're ready, babe
So come on ladies let's get up out of this club
Kel's dreamin', Rese's after party come on fuck with us

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up

Ooh, this song has got me hungry, baby, baby
So tell me that you want me, baby, baby
And girl, I'll love you 'til the sun shines
And girl, I promise I will make you my mine

Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks
And I don't see nothin' wrong with havin' a kid
Sounds like heaven's callin' us
And girl, well, it's about makin' love

If you choose me I guarantee
That the rest of your life would be man drama free
I think both of us should leave this club
And get somewhere alone with me
Where there's no phones to ring and plant this magic seed

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Your house, my house don't matter, heat it up
Your city, my city don't matter, give it up
Somethin' about being with you make me wanna, baby
Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby

You can play all you want but I know you feel it too
For 3 weeks you been talkin' about extra bedrooms
In New York meetin' with the realtor
There somethin' you wanna tell me, just say it, I'll pay it

Oh girl, I'ma take care of you
And I'ma still hold you like we brand new
So don't get it twisted for 30 somethin' weeks
I'm still gon' hit it and baby sit it, baby sit it

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Take you out to eat uh-uh
Wine and dine uh-uh
Shoppin' spree, uh-uh
You sexin' me uh huh
See, I'm not cheap
Or selfish babe (no ah)
Girl, I'm just thurstin' (no ha)
For that booty, babe

And it's all your fault, baby, you look so good
It's all your fault that it feels like wood
And you look so bored up in this club so let's go
We can hop in the Lamborghini, roll to my big home

Shorty let's go crazy, let's make a lil' Kelly
Baby, I got goodies and I want you to have some (have some)
All I ask that you let me explore your secret garden

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you pregnant)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (oh oh pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)

How could this be, you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, for I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, for I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, for I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, for I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Oh whisper three words, and I'll come runnin'
And I, and girl, you know that I'll be there, I'll be there

Well I'm not feeling the love no more
And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
Tell me how where we go wrong

Feels like I'm living all alone in this old house
Cause you're distance brings the worst of you
It's like a battle of silence... for

And we we're doing it 'til the morning light

Loud music and talks people where all the party sings

It reminded me of a dream I had

She said to me let go and be free
Then she told the driver 
Mind his business and then went there on me

Then I told her 
We're just fifteen minutes from my home

She kept saying it feels so incredible wrong

Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell, the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah (ooh, yeah)
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too, too many times
Now I can't come around

'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember

And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa

Right outside of Chicago

Oh I am her crown and he is my sky
If life is a road, then she is my ride
When I'm in pain, she's my good feeling
When I am sick she brings me healing
Whenever I call, she is right there
And when I fall, she says a prayer
When it comes to making love to me she knows how to do it

R. Kelly,"This song goes out
To all the people out there that be running they mouth
And they don't know what
The hell they sayin'
Shut up!

Now that I've got my voice back let me start off sayin' that
I appreciate the fans around the world that had my back
And I just wanna thank God upstairs for keeping His hands on me
And keeping all the doctors focused through my surgery
Now, there's a couple of things I gotta get off my chest
Some serious issues that I must address so
Well, let's just get right to people said that I was done
Said there was no way this time he's gonna over come
And even before the doctors was done and I could awake
A tsunami of rumors had come to wipe my career away
After twenty two years of a blessed career
Had me lying in my hospital bed crying mad tears ooh
But just as I have many people hatin' me
Had so many people loving me
And let's not forget the hood around the world covering me
And to everybody that be calling me
Telling what they've been sayin' about me
Bringin' all of this negative s*** and
Y'all the ones I ain't f***ing with
It's time for me to evaluate the people that I let up in my space
Can I get a witness for all of this
When people all up in your business

Tell 'em shut up, tell 'em shut up
Tell 'em shut up!
I'm talking to you
Tell 'em all shut up,
Tell 'em all shut up
Tell 'em all shut up
And tell 'em, I'm talking to you

He's washed up, he's lost it
He ain't gotta no more
Well I'm here to tell you today boy you haters are so slow
And it saddens me to know
Some of y'all want me to go away
Well when it's time for me to go
My God is gonna orchestrate
Until then I will accept the stones
Pray and try to get along but sometimes it's so hard for me to be strong
See I got kids and I'm tryin' to love 'em
So many things that I'm tryin' to juggle
But I never thought this music would become my struggle oh
The news said I lost my house my own people put me down
And my friends no longer around no
But you see deep underneath the surface
I feel something's working in my behalf a victory is near yeah
See my future ain't my past it's not the end of the hour glass
Who said it would not last
Fans sick they a**

Tell 'em shut up, shut up, shut up
Tell 'em shut up, I'm talking
I'm talking to you, shut ooh, shut up, shut up, shut up y'all
Shut up, if you talking 'bout me I'm talking to you

Now seriously after all these hits and melodies and memories
You compare me to someone else O-M-G
Now no offense to the other artist but come on dawg
Let's be honest how many babies been made off me O-M-G
Seriously you gonna act like that
Sit there like it ain't no truth to that
Looking at me like I ain't talking stats O-M-G
Every boy, every girl, every child around the world
From the 90's up until today was made off me

Shut up, shut up, shut up

Get you and lay you down, and make you scream

In a room full of just us
Exactly what I prayed for see
Heaven answered my prayer
Thank you God now that I'm here with you
Get ready baby

So ready to explode
In you
I'm so glad that you took my hand when I said
Get out of here with me baby
Thank you baby, ooh
