Kris Thomas,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
'Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all those things I should have done
When I was your man",When I Was Your Man [The Voice Performance]
Krisanthi Pappas,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Krisanthi Pappas,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Krisanthi Pappas,"How glad the many millions
Of Annabelle's and Lilian's
Would be, to capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell, and it was swell
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that I'm attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a lovely cottage that, do you wanna meet Monday to pick up the forniture
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

Could you coo, there you go again, could you care, now wait a minute
For a lovely cottage that we could share
The world will pardon my mush
But I have got a crush, my baby, on you, oh yeah",I've Got a Crush on You
Krisanthi Pappas,"Things have come to a pretty pass, 
Our romance is growing flat,
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that.
Goodness knows what the end will be,
Oh, I don't know where I'm at...
It looks as if we two will never be one,
Something must be done.

You say eether and I say eyether,
You say neether and I say nyther,
Eether, eyether, neether, nyther,
Let's call the whole thing off!
You like potato and I like potahto,
You like tomato and I like tomahto,
Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto!
Let's call the whole thing off!
But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh!  If we ever part,
Then that might break my heart!
So, if you like pajamas and I like pajahmas,
I'll wear pajamas and give up pajahmas.
For we know we need each other, 
So we better call the calling off off.
Let's call the whole thing off!

You say laughter and I say lawfter,
You say after and I say awfter,
Laughter, lawfter, after, awfter,
Let's call the whole thing off!
You like vanilla and I like vanella,
You, sa's'parilla and I sa's'parella,
Vanilla, vanella, Choc'late, strawb'ry!
Let's call the whole thing off!
But oh! If we call the whole thing off,
Then we must part.
And oh! If we ever part, 
Then that might break my heart!
So, if you go for oysters and I go for ersters
I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters.
For we know we need each other,
So we better call the calling off off!

Krisanthi Pappas,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Krisanthi Pappas,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay
Krisanthi Pappas,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Krisanthi Pappas,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard
Krisanthi Pappas,"Everything has its season 
Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme

Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man his daydreams 
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)

Gotta find my corner, yes I do
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky",Corner of the Sky
Krisanthi Pappas,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cos you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young

Krisanthi Pappas,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Cherry flavored licks- Just one taste is a trip."" Cherry.

Outside my window, shower window.
No glass impaired my sight this night
As a vision pulled my ear, “Come out here.”
All the atmosphere had shattered
And fell in fragments like dark glass from the sky.
No one can say, none can detail
Where droplets splashed and shards rushed maddened.

Everything was a shade of blue,
Round and grand and blue,
So close, I had to check what planet I was on.
How radiant the sphere appeared! 
Glowing water waved a mirror.
Long points of white turned the earth with sparkling hums.

The continents seemed a little fuzzy
As they throbbed in their green pattern.
I stretched my arms to their expanse,
So round, so bold,
So feeling and yet small.
Through this night I could fly
Past all wintery fences high,
Alone for miles around.

Am I too far above ground?
The motion pulled, so where’s too far?

My elbows leaned on the tile
I forgot there was tile for a while
And soaked in absence of time.
The steam gathered dew in mind.

Or agree to what they are

Kristen Lawrence,"Soul Day, Soul Day, we be come a‘ souling.
Pray, good people, remember the poor,
And give us a soul cake. 
Soul, soul, a soul cake!
Please, good lady, a soul cake!
An apple, a pear, a plum or a cherry,
Any good thing to make us merry.
Soul, soul, a soul cake!
Pray we for a soul cake!
One for Peter, two for Paul,
And three for Him who made us all.

God bless the master of this house, the mistress also,
And all the little children who ‘round your table grow.
Likewise, your men and maidens, your cattle and your store,
And all that dwell within your gates, we wish you ten times more.

Souling Day, so we pray for the souls departed.
Pray give us a cake,
For we are all poor people well-known to you before.

Little Jack, Jack sat on his gate,
Crying for butter, to butter his cake.
Up with your kettles, and down with your pans,
Give us our souling, and we’ll be gone.

Down into the cellar, and see what you can find.
If your barrels are not empty, we hope you will prove kind.
We hope you will prove kind with your apples and your grain,
And we’ll come no more a’ souling ‘til this month comes again.

Soul Day, Soul Day, we have been praying
For the souls departed, so pray good people, give us a cake.
So give us a cake for charity’s sake
And our blessing we’ll leave at your door.",Souling Song [All Hallows' Version] [Version]
Kristen Lawrence,"Soul, soul, soul cakes!
We come hunting for soul cakes!
We are dead, but like we said,
On this night we’ll take your bread
And while you’re out of your abode,
Lighting fires of Samhain old,
Think of us, out of body
As we are, you, too, shall be.

Samhain Night, at long last,
We parade from ages past
A journey from the Otherworld
Oh, the hairs that we have curled!

Winter’s Eve surrounds us,
Its open portal astounds us.
We creep into the living sphere,
And see where memories summon here.
Find us in this coldness,
Visiting with much boldness.
Share your food; we’ll share our power
To discern a future hour.

Summer’s End, Summer’s End
Will the sun return, vital warmth to send?
Summer’s End, Summer’s End
Darkness lengthens in its stride across the sleeping land.

Little Jack, Jack sat on his gate,
Offering goblins and demons his cake.
Up with the chill and down with the sun,
Waning and waning, the Dark Half’s begun.
All this night as boundaries untie,
Visitors friendly and frightful stop by.
Up with your mask and down with your feet,
Marching and marching to lead out the fleet.

How about this dwelling?
Its offerings are compelling,
With drinks and cakes and porridge,
And cherries and berries from storage.
Rattles at your door!
Don’t be scared, but give us some more!
A banshee or a fershee might delight by new firelight.",Souling Song [Samhain Version] [Version]
Kristen Lawrence,"Succulent biting and sucking to our desire
Forever mark the Vampire Empire.
Come have a taste of our vicious kisses
Then drink, awake to the pulsing blood where bliss is.

Undead, un-reflected, seeking a neck to bite,
We shun the sun and hark the dark night.
Don’t cross us or pointed words from our lips
Will stab your gloat – and throat – ending in dripping sips.

Garlic or our lick?  Will sticky blood be your pick?
Drains by Romanian fangs are quick.
Sharpen your smile and, while midnight dancing with us,
Chase lushly the blush of Eternal Spring.",Vampire Empire
Kristen Lawrence,"I’m mostly a ghost, but I still have my head.
I don’t mean to boast, but I’m better than dead.
For, those folks in graves are still lying intact,
And each ghost behaves as though all-dead, in fact.

I keep my mind here, in my hands, at my side.
But, yes, through my ear all my brains seem to slide.
Oh, I love my head; I was clever in life,
But witlessness dread, so beware of my scythe.",Mostly Ghostly [Exit Music]

Empty thoughts top his spine instead.
Oooooooh!
Isn't it the truth now that he is dead?",Ghost of John [Dead Composers Version] [Version]
Kristen Lawrence,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door;
Only this, and nothing more.""

Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore,
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,
Nameless here forevermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;
This it is, and nothing more.""

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
""Sir,"" said I, ""or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you.""  Here I opened wide the door;—
Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""
Merely this, and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before,
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely, that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore;
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;
‘Tis the wind, and nothing more.""

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door;
Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door,
Perched, and sat, and nothing more

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly shore,
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore.
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as ""Nevermore.""

But the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered;
Till I scarcely more than muttered, ""Other friends have flown before;
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.""
Then the bird said, ""Nevermore.""

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore,—
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of “Never—nevermore.”

But the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking, ""Nevermore.""

Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, O quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore!""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
On this home by horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore:
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me I implore!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore."" 

""Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting—
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore."" 

And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming;
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws the shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted—nevermore!",The Raven

You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
A million or more times?

I speak your name in my ev'ry prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

Darling, can't you see? 'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
I know how Columbus felt
Finding another world

Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been going on?

Dear when in your arms I creep
That divine rendezvous
Drawn to wake me if I'm asleep
Let me dream that it's true

Kiss me twice, then once more
That makes thrice, lets make it four
What a break, for heaven's sake

How long has this been going on?

Who is very inspirational
He is very inspirational because of many things

I come in at 8:11
And he smiles and says: ""How are you?""
When he smiles and says: ""How are you?""
I could swear my heart grows wings!

So today at 8:11
I decided I should meet him
I decided I should meet him
In a proper formal way

So today at 8:11
When he smiled and said: ""How are you?""
I said: ""Fine, and my name’s Kristin,""
And he softly answered: ""Hey.""
And I said ""My name’s Kristin
And thank you for the extra foam...""

And he said his name was Taylor
Which provides the inspiration for this poem:

Taylor, the latte boy
Bring me java, bring me joy!
Taylor, the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

So I’d like to get my nerve up
To recite my poem musical
He would like the fact it’s musical
Because he plays guitar

So today at 8:11
Taylor told me he was playing
In a band down in the village
In the basement of a bar

And he smoothly flipped the lever
To prepare my double-latte
But for me he made it triple!
(And he didn’t think I knew)
But I saw him flip the lever
And for me he made it triple
And I knew that triple-latte meant
That Taylor loved me, too!

I said: ""What time are you playing?
And thank you for the extra skim...""
He said: ""Keep the $3.55,""
Because this triple latte was on him

Taylor, the latte boy
Bring me java, bring me joy!
Taylor, the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

I used to be the kind of girl
Who’d run when love rushed toward her
'Til finally a voice whispered: ""Love can be yours
If you step up to the counter and order,""

Taylor, the latte boy
Bring me java, bring me joy!
Taylor, the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

So many years my heart has waited
Who’d have thought that love
Could be so caffeinated?
Taylor, the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

I love him, I love him, I love him!","Taylor, The Latte Boy [*]"
Kristin Chenoweth,"There will never be another
Who will love me like You
There will never be another
Who could hold me, mold me

There will never be another
Who could love me purely
No, there will never be another
Who has loved me like You

And I know that there will never be another love
Who could ever be the love that You are
'Cause You had so much to lose
But still You gave it up for Your scars
But that's the way You are

And if I spent my life attending Universities
Educated in the wisdom of men
And if I could even quote a guy like Socrates
Even then I couldn't comprehend

That there will never be another
Who will love me like You
There will never be another
Who could hold me, mold me

There will never be another
Who could love me purely
No, there will never be another
Who has loved me like You

And I know I'll never understand the mystery
If I live to be a hundred and three
How You died to live the love You give to me

There will never be another
Who will love me like You
There will never be another
Who could hold me, mold me

There will never be another
Who could love me purely
No, there will never be another

Kristin Chenoweth,"When others see with earthly eyes
Just what they wannna see
You will see the face that never die

You will know and recognize
My simple child like face
The priceless truth others will deny

When others say, ""he's just a man
Who likes to dream his dream""
When others call a miracle, a myth

You listen for eternity
In moments as they pass
And see with spirit eyes what others miss

Upon this rock, I?ll build my kingdom
And on this rock, forever and ever it shall stand
And though the powers of Hell itself
Shall never more prevail against it
For Satan?s thrones are built on sinking sand

Upon this rock, I?ll build my kingdom
And on this rock, forever and ever it shall stand
Upon this rock of revelation
I?ll build a strong and mighty nation
And it shall stand the storms of time, upon this rock

A famous simple carpenter
You see the son of God
If You could choose to lose when You could win

If You would give Your life away
With nothing in return
Then You are where my kingdom will begin

Upon this rock, I?ll build my kingdom
And on this rock, forever and ever it shall stand
And though the powers of Hell itself
Shall never more prevail against it
For Satan?s thrones are built on sinking sand

For the things I've done,

Crayons ready?
Very well
Begin to color me

These are the eyes that watched him as he walked away
Color them grey
This is the heart that thought he would always be true
Color it blue

These are the arms that held him and touched him
Lost him somehow
Color them empty now
These are the beads I wore 
Until she came between
Color them green

This is the room that I sleep in and walk in 
And weep in and hide in
That nobody, nobody's seen
Oh, color it lonely, please

This is the man whose love I depended upon
Color him gone",My Coloring Book
Kristin Chenoweth,"It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears,
After all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight,
No stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear

If you've had enough,
Don't put up with his stuff,
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill,
Get the check pay the bill,
You can do it

Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough, is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough

If you've reached the end,
Don't pretend that is right
When it's over (it's over)
If the feeling is gone

Kristin Chenoweth,"Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh, why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow why, oh, why can't I?",Over the Rainbow
Kristin Chenoweth,"You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here

Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say, ""Goodbye""
Try to forgive, teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories, no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say, ""Goodbye""
Help me say, ""Goodbye""",Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again
Kristin Chenoweth,"He's a fool and don't I know it 
But a fool can have his charms 
I'm in love and don't I show it 
Like a babe in arms 

Love's the same old sad sensation 
Lately I've not slept a wink 
Since this crazy situation 
Put me on the blink 

I'm wild again, beguiled again 
A simpering, whimpering child again 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 

I couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep 
Until I could sleep where I shouldn't sleep 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 

Lost my heart, but what of it? 
My mistake, I agree 
He's a laugh but I love it 
Although the laugh's on me 

I'll sing to him, each spring to him 
And long for the day when I'll cling to him 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 

Lost my heart, but what of it? 
He is cold, I agree 
He's a laugh but I love it

Oh, I should be happy

I only know that since he left my life's so empty
Though I try to forget it just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
I don't know how in the world

Of course I do

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name

From millionaires to caddies
Would be
To capture me

But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell
And it was swell
You're my big and brave and handsome romeo
How you won me I shall never, never know

It's not that you're attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you
Came into view

You've got a crush on me, sweetie pie

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossomed covered lane

Wonderful music, yes, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

There's a box insied my chest
An animal stuffed with my frustrations
Can you hear me?

You make me act like other people do forgive me

Falling over your face I fly out the window
And then ride the wind down

Picking up pieces of mine
Tie me up with twine in your eye light

'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

Could you coo, there you go again, could you care, now wait a minute
For a lovely cottage that we could share

Kristin Kovner,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Kristin Kovner,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Kristin Kovner,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Kristin Lomholt,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Grows dark and full of clouds

When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

Noch abends in der Bar

Und nannte mich Cherie
Es war die Sommernacht in der Paris in Flammen stand.
Champagner kam dazu
War er auch ein Filou
Es war schön mit Gilbert
So schön mit Gilbert
Und die Nacht war wie er.
Er schenkte mir den Eiffelturm
Beim ersten Rendezvous
Und dieses leises ""mon amore""
Trank ich aus
Wie das Leben pur.
Er schenkte mir den Eiffelturm
Und ganz Paris dazu
Ich war verliebt wie nie zuvor
Auch wenn ich nie ganz mein Herz verlor.
In der Nacht
Wenn sang sein Lied
Ich ahnte
Was geschieht
Gilbert war so ein Mann
Mit dem man Sterne träumen kann.
Der Ring an seiner Hand
War nie ein Diamant
See'est la vie
Sagte er
So war nur Gilbert
Und Paris war wie er.
Er schenkte mir den Eiffelturm
Beim ersten Rendezvous
Und dieses leises ""mon amore""

Kristina Cornell,"Her mama took her shoppin'
Said, ""Anything you please
They got dolls with pretty dresses
How 'bout one of these?""
She said, 'All I want is a little red balloon""

""And a box of Magic Markers
The permanent kind
All the colors of the rainbow
That's what I had in mind
And a little ball of string
Then we can go home""

She was sittin' on the window sill
Lookin' at the sky
She said a little prayer
And let it fly

“I miss you, Dad
How are things in Heaven?
I wish you could have been here
For my birthday
You know I just turned seven”

“I'm sendin' you this message
I hope you get it soon
I wrote it in big letters on my
Little red balloon”

Four years ago last Sunday
The angels came to call
The family gathered in the kitchen
She sat cryin' in the hall
Holdin' on tight to her favorite teddy bear

He loved to tell her stories
He'd sit her on his knee
He taught her how to ride her bike
When she was barely three
Now she only gets to see him
In her dreams

Now she talks to him as if he's there
From the window of her room
Says, ""Daddy, when you comin' home?
Did you get my last balloon?""

“I miss you, Dad
How are things in Heaven?
I wish you could have been here
For my birthday
I just turned eleven”

“I wonder if you've ever met
The man in the moon
Is he the one who helps you find my
Little red balloons?”

Now that little girl
Is all grown up
But she still finds the time
To keep in touch

“I miss you, Dad
How are things in Heaven?
I'm gettin' married next July
I wish you could'a met him”

“What I'd give to have you here
To see my dreams come true
I guess I'll just keep sendin' you these
Little red balloons”

I miss you, Dad
I miss you, Dad

But all I can hear is static
Turn the volume up one time
The confidence is lacking
Hiding in the shadows

What's with all these walls up?

You can feel the rhythm
But your body's being modest
Trapped in your cocoon
But underneath you are a goddess
Baby, you're the hottest
I'm just being honest
You should be released
Back into the wild

You'll be out of the dark
When you're watching me, you're an animal
And it's easy to see you're an animal

All you hear is but that heartbeat
Taking your position
To the hype that's in the story
Feeding off the spirits and the people are arousing
I can feel you pouncing
Damn the room is bouncing

Read me with the eyes
Ready to play
See me in the eyes
I'll be your prey

No more hesitation
The train has left the station
You should be released

Remember that love is the reason
The good things in life don't come easy

Just for a time
And I will be just fine

Needing your love
  
If I ask of you is it all right

Through a cold dark night 
Cause there may be a cloudy day in sight 
And I need to let you know that I might 
Be needing your love
  
And what I'm trying to say isn't really new
It's just the things that happen to me

Like when I hear your name
Or see a place that you've been 
Or see a picture of your grin
Or pass a house that you've been in

Kristine Mills,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Kristine Snyder,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven

What am I so afraid of 

'Cause every time that you're next to me
There's no doubt in my mind
That you're right where you should be
And if you'd just hold me
I'd never be lonely again

You're my every wish
My dream come true
My everything
If only you knew

I just can't help my heart
You're that someone who
Turns my world around
If you only knew

Maybe it's only in my mind
Where love reigns all the time
Do you believe? I still believe.

Our brother's sleeping all alone in the park
His head is resting on a pillow of hope
Then he says dance for me
He gives me smiles for free
He trades a joke for mine
And the world is fine
And we let love reign
Reach out and don't be afraid
Everything you do
It will be coming back to you
Let love reign

A rich man's sitting on his velvet couch
His kingdom rains
Until he's drowning my dreams
Then he says sing for me
Give me your song for free
I'd trade his soul for mine if I could only make him kind
And he'd let love reign
Reach out don't be afraid
Everything you do 
It's coming back to you
There's a kingdom of kindness where love is
And a rainbow will come with the rain's kiss
And love remains when love reigns

I do believe that love remains
I do believe that love reigns
When love rains
Everything I do is coming back I know
And I will let love reign

To dry the tears from my eyes
Yes you always cared and I do believe
That you were sent from heaven above

Because you taught me about love
I feel you up there somewhere
Someone watching over me
You gave me joy

You eased my pain
You showed me how to love again
And I thank you 'cause you always knew you'd be
Watching over me

Hallelujah, you came my way
Hallelujah, for your birthday
Hallelujah, now I see
You're watching over me

I hear your voice in the wind
When I'm needing a friend
The autumn leaves in the breeze
Bring a love that you send

And I do believe that
You are dancin', dancin' on clouds
I hear you laughing
Laughing out loud
And I know you're up there somewhere

Who was, who was, who was the boss

Who claimed that
I didn't control
Whatever moved in my soul

I could tempt, touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight?

You got to be real
And it probably feels stronger than solid steel
Stronger than doses of gamma rays

Stronger than tsunami winds

Stronger than takin’ some Jamaica rum

We express it when we use it
Somethin’ to alleviate the stress for a minute

I cried me a sea,I cried me an ocean,I cried me a stream,

Im outta emotion got nothin' in me,
And I would have done anything in the world for you 
I would have done anything that you told me too,
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea and I ain't got nothin' left in me

You cant have my number don't wanna be friends 
I don't care to see you now and then its not that im bitter 
Its just that I'm done my heart finally said enough is enough

So now you are sorry like your all in love 
But you wasn't sorry when you messed it all up

Theres no way your gettin' near this or have me again 
Until hell has frozen over you need to understand you'll never get with me again

Baby speak up, cause your silence is killing me
(your silence is killin' me)
I've had enough, baby speak up
Are you lovin' or hatin' me
Cause I can never tell, I can never tell
Just let your heart say what you can't say (speak up)
Let your heart say what you won't say (speak up)
Don't let the silence tear us away
Cause I can never tell, I can never tell

If you don't speak up
Open up your mouth cause baby I'm listenin'",Speak Up

I'm giving everyone attitude
I'm losing air I'm slowly dying
Kill me if I cant be around you
I don't wanna be too dramatic
Breaking up is problematic
I don't even know what to do

[Chorus]
But all I know is that I'm missing you
I don't care bout nothing else but you
I'm like two steps (two steps from losing it)
One more step I disconnect
Feel like I might as well be dead
No I really don't think I'll make it without you
Not about to baby

I try to deal but it don't make sense
I cant believe this is happening
I'm losing tears

If u were here
Im sure they would drown you
(no)i dont wanna make it sound so tragic
(no)i believe we stil got magic
I just need to know you do too

You gotta come through boy
I'm counting on you boy
You know what to do boy
You should call a girl up and save her life
Tell her you're not goin' let her die
No way that's gonna happen tonight

I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

La jambe légère et l'œil polisson
Et la bouche pleine de joyeux ramages
Allait à la chasse aux papillons

Comme il atteignait l'orée du village
Filant sa quenouille, il vit Cendrillon
Il lui dit ""Bonjour, que Dieu te ménage
Je t'emmène à la chasse aux papillons""

Cendrillon ravie de quitter sa cage
Met sa robe neuve et ses bottillons
Et bras dessus bras dessous vers les frais bocages
Ils vont à la chasse aux papillons

Il ne savait pas que sous les ombrages
Se cachait l'amour et son aiguillon
Et qu'il transperçait les cœurs de leur âge
Les cœurs des chasseurs de papillons

Quand il se fit tendre, elle lui dit ""Je présage
Que c'est pas dans les plis de mon cotillon
Ni dans l'échancrure de mon corsage
Qu'on va à la chasse aux papillons""

Sur sa bouche en feu qui criait ""Sois sage!""
Il posa sa bouche en guise de bâillon
Et ce fut le plus charmant des remue-ménage
Qu'on ait vu de mémoire de papillon

Un volcan dans l'âme, ils revinrent au village
En se promettant d'aller des millions
Des milliards de fois, et même davantage
Ensemble à la chasse aux papillons

Mais tant qu'ils s'aimeront, tant que les nuages
Porteurs de chagrins, les épargneront
Il fera bon voler dans les frais bocages

Kristo Numpuby,"Il avait nom corne d'Aurochs, au gué, au gué
Tout l'monde peut pas s'appeler Durand, au gué, au gué

En le regardant avec un œil de poète
On aurait pu croire à son frontal de prophète
Qu'il avait les grandes eaux de Versailles dans la tête
Corne d'Aurochs

Mais que le bon dieu lui pardonne, au gué, au gué
C'étaient celles du robinet, au gué, au gué

On aurait pu croire en l'voyant penché sur l'onde
Qu'il se plongeait dans des méditations profondes
Sur l'aspect fugitif des choses de se monde
Corne d'Aurochs

C'étaient hélas pour s'assurer, au gué, au gué
Que le vent n'l'avait pas décoiffé, au gué, au gué

Il proclamait à son de trompe à tous les carrefours
""Il n'y a qu'les imbéciles qui sachent bien faire l'amour
La virtuosité c'est une affaire de balourds!""
Corne d'Aurochs

Il potassait à la chandelle, au gué, au gué
Des traités de maintien sexuel, au gué, au gué
Et sur les femmes nues des musées, au gué, au gué
Faisait l'brouillon de ses baisers, au gué, au gué

Et bientôt petit à petit, au gué, au gué
On a tout su, tout su de lui, au gué, au gué

On a su qu'il était enfant de la Patrie
Qu'il était incapable de risquer sa vie
Pour cueillir un myosotis à une fille
Corne d'Aurochs

Qu'il avait un petit cousin, au gué, au gué
Haut placé chez les argousins, au gué, au gué
Et que les jours de pénurie, au gué, au gué
Il prenait ses repas chez lui, au gué, au gué

C'est même en revenant d'chez cet antipathique
Qu'il tomba victime d'une indigestion critique
Et refusa l'secours de la thérapeutique

Parce que c'était un Allemand, au gué, au gué

Et sa vie n'ayant pas été originale

Kristo Numpuby,"C'est à travers de larges grilles
Que les femelles du canton
Contemplaient un puissant gorille
Sans souci du qu'en-dira-t-on

Avec impudeur, ces commères
Lorgnaient même un endroit précis
Que, rigoureusement ma mère
M'a défendu dénommer ici gare au gorille

Tout à coup, la prise bien close
Où vivait le bel animal
S'ouvre on ne sait pourquoi
(Je suppose qu'on avait du la fermer mal)

Le singe, en sortant de sa cage
Dit ""c'est aujourd'hui que je le perds""
Il parlait de son pucelage
Vous avez deviné, j'espère gare au gorille

Le patron de la ménagerie
Criait, éperdu, ""Nom de nom
C'est assommant car le gorille
N'a jamais connu de guenon""

Dès que la féminine engeance
Sut que le singe était puceau
Au lieu de profiter de la chance
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux gare au gorille

Celles là même qui, naguère
Le couvaient d'un œil décidé
Fuirent, prouvant qu'elles n'avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées

D'autant plus vaine était leur crainte
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l'homme dans l'étreinte
Bien des femmes vous le diront gare au gorille

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d'atteinte du singe en rut
Sauf une vielle décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut

Voyant que toutes se dérobent
Le quadrumane accéléra
Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vielle et du magistrat gare au gorille

""Bah, soupirait la centiare
Qu'on puisse encore me désirer
Ce serait extraordinaire
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré""

Le juge pensait, impassible
""Qu'on me prenne pour une guenon
C'est complètement impossible""
La suite lui prouva que non gare au gorille

Supposez que l'un de vous puisse être
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre
Lequel choisirait-il des deux?

Qu'une alternative pareille
Un de ces quatres jours, m'échoie
C'est, j'en suis convaincu, la vielle
Qui sera l'objet de mon choix gare au gorille

Mais, par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l'amour vaut son prix
On sait qu'en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût, ni par l'esprit

Lors, au lieu d'opter pour la vielle
Comme aurait fait n'importe qui
Il saisit le juge à l'oreille
Et l'entraîna dans un maquis gare au gorille

La suite serait délectable
Malheureusement, je ne peux
Pas la dire, et c'est regrettable
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu

Car le juge, au moment suprême
Criait, ""Maman"" pleurait beaucoup
Comme l'homme auquel, le jour même
Il avait fait trancher le cou gare au gorille

Kristo Numpuby,"Il pleuvait fort sur la grand-route
Elle cheminait sans parapluie
J'en avais un, volé, sans doute
Le matin même à un ami
Courant alors à sa rescousse
Je lui propose un peu d'abri
En séchant l'eau de sa frimousse
D'un air très doux, elle m'a dit ""oui""

Contre un coin de paradis
Elle avait quelque chose d'un ange

Chemin faisant, que ce fut tendre
D'ouïr à deux le chant joli
Que l'eau du ciel faisait entendre
Sur le toit de mon parapluie
J'aurais voulu, comme au déluge
Voir sans arrêt tomber la pluie
Pour la garder, sous mon refuge
Quarante jours, quarante nuits

Mais bêtement, même en orage
Les routes vont vers des pays
Bientôt le sien fit un barrage
A l'horizon de ma folie
Il a fallu qu'elle me quitte

Et je l'ai vue toute petite
Partir gaiement vers mon oubli

She sees everybody, for who they really are
I'm so thankful for her guidance,
She's helped me get this far

Like my mother does
And when I'm scared, I bow my head and pray!
Like my mother does
When I feel weak, and un-pretty!
I know I'm beautiful and strong!
Because, I see myself,
Like my mother does!

She's a rock!
She is grace!
She's an angel!
She's
My heart and soul!
She does it all!

My favorite addiction
You're no good to me
But all this attraction
Makes it hard to see
The line between what's right
And what I wanna do
So I've got to tell you

I'm gonna pack my bags
Leave a lipstick letter
Take the first plane out of town
I can't lie, I won't cry
I won't tell you goodbye
And I won't turn around
You're gonna be a sweet memory
But you'll never be Mr. Right
I'm gonna leave you baby
Yeah, someday I'll leave you baby
Just not tonight

You're so beautiful
You make me feel so free
And I get so emotional
When your lips touch me
I just can't breathe
But deep inside I know
This can't work out
So any day now

I'm gonna pack my bags
Leave a lipstick letter
Take the first plane out of town
I can't lie, I won't cry
I won't tell you goodbye
And I won't turn around
You're gonna be a sweet memory
But you'll never be Mr. Right
I'm gonna leave you baby

You know I need to leave you
But I can't leave you, I can't leave you now

Kristy Lee Cook,"I don't have a retirement plan
Just a hundred acre piece of black dirt land
And a red tractor sittin' in the shed

Startin' tomorrow they're callin' for rain
So you're turnin' over that field today
There's a wide world out there waitin' to be fed

May the sun always shine down upon you
Let the rain fall 'til you have all you need
It's God's job to turn everything into what He wants it to be
But God bless the ones who plant the seed

You don't mind livin' on a budget
You wouldn't teach school if you didn't love it
You're there before seven and stay long after five

In your class the kids learn more than English
You work with them 'til they believe that
They can do anything they want to with their lives

May the sun always shine down upon you
Let the rain fall 'til you have all you need
It's God's job to turn everything into what He wants it to be
But God bless the ones who plant the seed
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Here's to everyone
Who unselfishly runs
Their race so we can dream

May the sun always shine down upon you
Let the rain fall 'til you have all you need

'Til this fire gets hotter

Dip our toes in the water
We could sit on the fence and test the wind
Walk on the edge if jumping in
If we hesitate a moment to long
Our chance could be gone

Dont you wanna be mine
Something this good doesn't come along every day
Why wait


We could keep these words
On the tip of our tounge
Or come right out and say em
We could play these games
Play hard to get
Baby times a waistin
I'd rather be in a long slow kiss
Than having to hold my breath like this
It's a feeling I can't ignore
Can't hold it back anymore

Kristy Lee Cook,"My daddy was a soldier in a foreign war 
But he doesn't like to talk about it any more 
He kept a picture of my mama right by his heart 
He'd give it one last look before the fighting would start 
He said all I ask is that you don't forget 
Cause the wars not over when the fighting ends 

There's a part of me that will always be 
Just a boy in a hole with an M-16 
Airborne ranger infantry 

I left my best friend lying in a pool of blood 
While I crawled away through the brush and mud 
If I could choose to go back again 
I'd die lying there next to him 
I still see his face when I close my eyes 
As I won't forget his sacrifice 

There's a part of me that will always be 
Just a boy in a hole with an M-16 
Airborne ranger infantry 

I didn't do it for the money didn't do it for fame 
I didn't do it so the world would remember my name 
I did it for my family and my country, 
And my brothers who died right next to me. 

And all we ask is that you don't forget 
Cause the wars not over when the fighting ends 
There's a part of us that will always be 
Just boys in a hole with our M-16s

Time is cruel
To youth the grace of love is beauty
Life is hard, due unto others

More loss than gain

With a style to show that I'm another pistol that's elegant
Kaliko to cut the throat of me no patrollin me
Nickin every syllable that's strong enough to lift up an elephant
I consist that you're as soft as a moccasin
I can send niggas at you and have em take away your oxygen
I could then murder you in another dimension
Of diabolical proportions as I find a portal and lock them in
Eat the key up then re-up I'm gone
See the way that I re-up a G up, I'm on
Now I'mma hang my feet up from reeboks, it's on
Niggas this ain't a game put your wii up, I'm grown
I'm general militia and you be feelin every person
Though everybody can spit it but we still a very
Packin so much artillery we are like a military
And no tellin how many bodies we bout kill and bury
Gimme the block then I'mma ball
Because I be tippin
Spending the money when I'm in the mall like tryna be different
Different kinda clothes
Other kinda shoes
When the hoes see the swag they be askin if they can come and kick it
Shorty what you talkin bout just get your homies and come with it I'm over here Gettin drunk up the limousine
Now I got a drunken fast flow
But it don't matter I can still blow the whole party to smithereens
Splittin' words in the middle like kali-
Ko we Killin em cause you put together a team
As if you were Pat Riley
Cus ain't nobody compara-
Ble to us if you want it then you know what it means
Twista!

Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay A. Yates
You don’t know the handle then you’re a day late
Death and destruction it is they fate
Because when I get up on a track, it'll be like wait
Sick em deliver, get to flipping
You be the victim and I’mma pick em off
Fix em with a quick, and I’mma knock division off of niggas
No living giving or igging on the rigorous
Look at this, will somebody look at this
I be killing em
Put up or shut up, get up be cut up
It's animosity
Foot in ya gut up, bullet for colors
I’m an atrocity, wicked
I went around, arrange one off, I rip it
I’d rather be red and ready then running with the rigits
Don’t be stupid, if you got a minute better run away
You better jump im slumping you cause
Never gonna put the gun away
You better back up off of me or get it
Admit it, I’m killing off everybody and then it
Acquitted
And we knocking, he stopping
Never can beat the cleverness
She joshing, me cocking
Coming to get the head of the Chula
I shoot her because lots a Gouda
That dude'll be foolery, because I socked the ruler
Ay yay yay yay yay yay
Yank em, when he thinking he better then Nina
I gotta spank em, shank em with the thang
For thinking that we'll come & give up the game
We hang the really bane in my sanctum
They don’t really wanna see me
Tecca Nina eating your whole supper like Ziti
When I get to going, I smoke a nigga like a beady
I’m leaving em all dead lips blacker than Miss Sealy

Don't pretend number one contender

And got a proper referee never da have a legacy

No question, and I don't give a fuck
And you said that you fly, who bitch you won't lie
And you come an gets me you shit out of luck
I'mma come through a damage, everything that you own
Everything that you like, you ain't understanding
Is it hard to decode, can you see in my eyes
That I'm not to be played with, I'm possibly crazy and nuts
See monstrosities constantly y'all at the back of my mind
Bitch I damage, everything that's average
I'mma kill em again and gon' have no sammich
No spitting in Spanish mama si can a cien, ahora si
Si encuentro mi, mi. Let's do it again
Para si mi temo a ti, ti. Ti matar a tu friends

There is no evil, then if you peeping then leave him to us
Run from the steep hill, but either we can be meaning we bite
Not just a little, we try to eat up your veetle's for lunch
I think my sequel genius wasn't equal, people seen us they was teekel

We sing clinge the thing is I am sterilized
He sing sing and scare and they terrified

So which way does he go
Ball to the fall every fall in a hole and
I won't stop even at all till I'm am known
The world so cold I make them fall with a quote (okay)

Spider K's a rhyme vet I'm next (okay)
But only pretty boys would get laid but I'm sex (okay)

So if you got your chin down and
If anybody can come in and kill and gut the haters so now
K.O.D. and Seepage make them so their cleavage freakish
Maybe they bust spin out the bus
So we cause the leakage
'Cause its unfair to be this rarity
Thought I would be some charity case
The industry would be scared of my face

'Cause I don't fit in any of they categories
This fat boy will show you how these independent adults make them noises
I was real hard now I'm real easy to look at
Breezys don't think I look real fat
My CD ain't easy to put back
See we got's to you lanes
Roll odd to a strange

Shaking the chick and I got carnal, taking a flick and I shot porno
Naked and wicked is not formal, waking the sick when I got born on the funny farm

In the morn got to horn the corn holes, look at the six and the seven on my arm
Though nigga I'm totally torn yo
Obli get an I'm boss in this shit, but you're quick to get a girlfriend 
With this off sum script then I'm rockin this chick,

Ants in you're pants ill make ya dance

I see that you want to be free
And I feel your pain
Know what you think before you tell me about to go insane
With out your music
And you can't make it through the day then
Crying a river for your love that's passed away
No body told us that good days was promised to us
No body that could tell you it's gonna be okay well

I, well I
I hope today's the day that I can find something to say to make ya
Turn away from from all your scars

That I can find something to say to make ya
Turn away from from all your scars

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Life ain't always a party but we gotta do it because its required
And it cuts like a knife and I gotta get the beast outta my life
And it sucks when your suffering standerly buffering
I think I can,I think I can
Think I can make it if I had you there to hold my hand
And you saved me
Been down but you raised me
I think that you feel what I feel Kali Baby

I'm a daily endeavor no body fade me and clever
But the wavy see slegna we bled for a plethora of
People in many places healing so many faces
The gape in my soul put a lot of my pain into plenty cases
So they seeking my flows
All of them waiting to play
'Cause in that moment the pains taken away
Making the day straight having Satan delay wait
Never wanna hate wraith in a way
I get people through I've been told
They won't seek a new I've been chose
I don't preach I just dive in souls
Way down deep I sift highs and lows
I bring peace when I spit live in shows
I see grief when I ripped I them walls
When I sing heat when inside them groves
Rotting beasts for them N9ne explodes
Wish I could take it all together for ever
The pain I see in your eye, I try
To break it up and sever for the better
And will till I die, die, die

I, well I
I pray today's the day that I can find something to say to make ya
Turn away from from all your scars
Turn away from from your scars
Now I, now I
I pray today's the day
That I can find something to say to make ya
Turn away from from all your scars
Turn away from from your scars

I get all y'all messages man
Telling me how the music helps you get through your day, through your life, through your losses

I wanna love you forever, that’s why we’re still together
Why you be trippin so much? You make it tougher than leather
See one minute you love it, then the next one you hate it
You like to argue with a nigga, I’ll be participatin
See you sweet as a donut, then you flip me, you go nuts
You always trippin with somebody, if you don't it's a bonus
You keep it peaceful but evil, you can’t be yelling at people
Sometimes I think I should move on, I should just go'on and just leave you
Don’t try to tell me nothing, you just be fussin and cussin' me out
Don’t understand what all the fussin about
Open the door, get the W out
But you were thinkin 'fore you get to speakin and you got a foot in yo mouth
I don’t understand if you was putting me out
Will I be losing? I think it's rude of you to got no scruple about

You can’t stand the sight of me but still it’s love that you show
'Cause you the baddest thing bumpin
And the maddest thing talkin
You make the ugliest faces even when I be jokin
I can’t stay with you for nothing, only a crazy man would
But I still can never leave you

Got it in an act when you been breaking my back
You give it to me, give it to me
I ain’t giving it back
Get a touch from my ex when I rub once over that
And I reminisce of this of eatin up a kitty cat
Seen the pickin, pick a time on the flow
And I wish that Crystal walk out the door
Do her thing and just about ready to go
But she kiss me, now I can’t eat for sho

Krizz Kaliko,"It all started yesterday, and now I can't think about nothing
Is it real, I know this can't be heaven sent
Wish I could dream it all away
And now all I need is a drug
That can help me make it through another day
Maybe its just me it won't let me be
And I don't really know what it is that keeps bothering me
But I'm saying

(Why me?) I wanna know how it is
To see the sun shining even if it isn't
(Why me?) I don't wanna know how it is
To hear me say it's all love when it isn't
(Why me?) I wanna know how it feels
To hear you laughing in my ear
(Why me?) I don't wanna know how it feels
If you didn't cheer
How can he handle this... Too many damages
He hit the nail on the head but never knew right where the hammer was
Don't think so loud, don't let them hear you scream
Baby it's even bigger than it seems

Now, now, now crazy is an act alike
Getting better in the after life or maybe not
Maybe I can ask her why the normality passed me by why when I'm a titan
Continue to breathe it dependent on people to get my mental state
Am I meant for this?
The Christian Krizz just have to wait
Pictures getting clearer it ain't me in the mirror
See its that other nigga only his egos bigger
And he'll pull the tigger when I usually hesitate
And he'll go on 'em when I'm steadily saying wait
Now I'm just a shell of myself
I don't want anybodies help
Maybe I do maybe I do this for you
This is my own hell
Is there a bottle some kind type posion that can end it
A different god I can pray to
Some type of doctor to fix it
Maybe its just me it won't let me be
And I'm to helpless, I guess

(Why me?)
I wanna know how it is to see the sun shining even if it isn't
(Why me?)
I don't wanna know how it is to hear me say it's all love when it isn't
(Why me?)
I wanna know how it feels to hear you laughing in my ear

I don't wanna know how it feels if you didn't cheer
How can he handle this
Too many damages
He hit the nail on the head but never knew right where the hammer was
Don't think so loud, don't let them hear you scream
Baby it's even bigger than it seems

How big is the fight in me
Frightfully fighting night to be day
I'm wishing that wifey would knife me for spiteful things that I say
Excuse me for thinking this way, I'm a little bit pessimistic
They sending blessing this way I guess I must of missed 'em
See my teary eyes through my Ray-Bans
Turning off the world and still looking for some amens
The girlies pee-pee when they see me, fans, they dance
Look in the mirror wanna see me
Here's their chance

Had a dream of a flag in white & red 
Swiss cross turned into the japan dot 
A yellow girl appeared and made me hot

She took me to her place - a Geisha house 
There was tea rice-booze & ceremony 
I got undressed she had me washed 
I felt her body and I was lost

Tokyo nights hot burning lights 
Tokyo nights you took my mind away 
Made me obsessed by loving fights

Soon I remembered I stayed in a dream 
And I could make a try to change the scene 
The geisha girl was just too hot for me 
I tried to wake up unsuccessfully

And even as the big alarm-clock rang 
Outside my window the first blackbird sang 
My yellow girlfriend didn't leave my head 
Got to stay forever in her bed

Tokyo nights you took my mind away 
I'm in the spell of your delights

And you're passin' the time



Well, you look through the paper

Five bottles later

Burning bones of war



Ashes on the floor


There stands a soldier
In a barbed-wire land


The fear of death in his eyes

And a bottle in his hand

But, now the wine he's drinking

It's got the taste of blood

No more plastic war movies

To show him what it's like

Only gonna hurt 
It's time you realized

If you got somethin' to say 
Go ahead 'n' fire away 
No matter what card you play 
It's you I've always needed

Our love will never die 
Don't know why 
It's a feelin' inside

We both had lovers outta town 
Both like foolin' around 
It doesn't really matter 
Because we'll never fall apart again...",Our Love [Uncensored Version]

Ready to rock, ready to roll
Ready to rock, are you ready?

Get ready to give me
What I want, what I need
Keep coming, I need more
Got a sweet tooth, she's my candy store

I'm gonna rock that girl tonight
Keep it up, do it right
Been waiting for so long
Got my hands full, she's Amazon!

The way she teases
She really drives me wild
She always pleases
And I love to hear her say

She's ready to rock, ready to roll
Ready to rock, get ready
Ready to rock, ready to roll
Ready to rock, are you ready?

I'm the lightning, she's the rain
Giving pleasure to ease the pain
Sweet thunder like a storm
Winds that blow 'till you're ripped and torn

She'll be where the girls in the crowd
Love to rock, love to scream out loud
Got a fever inside
Gonna find that girl, keep her satisfied

The way she teases
She really drives me wild

Krokus,"Teenage rebel, nothing to lose
Back against the wall, mad and confused
Every conversation seems to end in a fight
Older generations say
They should know what's wrong from right

But all he ever wanted was freedom to say
Leave me alone, let me live my way

Hard luck hero, can't you see
Gotta run, run, run if you wanna be free
Hard luck hero, you and me
Gotta run, run, run, like a river runs free
For you and me

Cool sunglasses and a fast machine
Black leather jacket, old blue jeans
Never liked to fight, but he knew he could
Going through life, hustled and misunderstood

But all he ever wanted was someone to show
A little bit of love, but he never know

Hard luck hero, can't you see
Well we got no cause, but you wanna be free
Hard luck hero, you and me
Gotta run, run, run, like a river runs free
For you and me
For you and me

Driving through the hills, running fast and free
Racing to the edge high above the sea
Couldn't slow down, had to pay the price
Never being bound to living someone else's life

No matter what happened, no matter what they say
He was a rebel 'til his dying day

Hard luck hero, can't you see
Well we got no cause, but you wanna be free

Krokus,"Girl, when I look back on
All of the treasures I've won
They used to shine for me
Now your face is all I see, all I see

All the fortune in my hand
Can't you see from where I stand
All I need is you

Dreamin' is all I do
See men holding you

Baby, when I look at all I've had
I know that I shouldn't be sad
But you and me were made for love
I know it's written in the stars above

Let the heartache end
And let this love begin
I know you'll see me through
All I need is you

I searched for the light
Find some heat in the night
And though I feel the flame
Without your love it's not the same
It's just not the same

Standin' here the river's wide
Got to get to the other side
All I want is you

Play for me your love song
Say you'll be the only one

Baby, when I look at all I've had
I know that I shouldn't be sad
But you and me were made for love
I know it's written in the stars above

Dreamin' is all I do
See men holding you

Baby, when I look at all I've had
I know that I shouldn't be sad
But you and me were made for love
I know it's written in the stars above

Krokus,"In my mind I can see
All the childhood reflections of me
Walkin' through the memory of long ago
So long ago

We were young, we free
There was nothin' that we couldn't be
Searchin' for adventure
Lookin' for love

Here as I sit alone in the dark
Million miles away
Wishin' that I could go back to the start
Knowin' that time won't bring back those days

I'm a long way from home
And I feel so all alone

Now my world's far away
And I'm travellin' out into space
To the edge of the universe
It's where I must go, where I will go

Through the stars, sailin' free
With the memory of what used to be
Searchin' for adventure
Lookin' for love

Here as I sit alone in the dark
Million light years away
Wishin' that I could go back to the start
Knowin' that time won't bring back those days

I'm a long way from home
And I feel so all alone
I'm a long way from home

Krokus,"A child was born on a cold and windy night
Not far away from the burning village lights
Another son in a poor family
Bit short on money but the loving ran free

And as he grew from a boy to a man
His mama cried but he didn't understand
Somehow she knew oh that someday he would go
Into the world and a life of his own

Say goodbye but never deny
All the love you're leaving behind
Don't forget all the feelings you know
They'll be with you wherever you go

Out in the world he's been living the good life
House, car and money with a true and loving wife
A child is born to this new family
They gave her everything with love guaranteed

And as she grew and the quarrels began
Her papa cried but she didn't understand
Somehow he know oh that someday she would go
Into the world and a life of her own",Say Goodbye
Krokus,"You're the magic in my life
Out of the darkness and into the light...
(Oh...only you...)
Under a spell...no disguise

Need the spirit in your eyes
(Oh...only you...)
Smile...in your eyes....

[Chorus]
I see the world on fire
With passion and desire
The flame of love is burnin' through
My lonely heart is empty

And though they try to tempt me
No one can take the place of you...
In the mirror, I can see
No reflection of you and me...

Swimmin' in sorrow, sea of pain
Will tomorrow bring you back again?
Smile...in your eyes....

[Chorus]

I'm a jester...not a king
I'd still give you everything you need...
Everything you need...
Give me fire...give me light

Break these chains before I die for you...
Only you...

Just life, I'm winning man.

I live my life the way I choose.
Satisfy not much to loose.

Won't you be my guest tonight

Steppin' into that supertrooper light
Will put our spirits right

Living out your fantasy

Rock'n'Roll holds the key



Crank up the volume, blast it out loud


Scream at the top of your heads



Fasten your seatbelts, into the smoke
One way up we go


And we're flying through the night away


Far far away
And we'll fing a place we'd like to stay

Far far away



Everywhere around the world

Rock is still alive

You get together with your best friends


On a magical drive


Crank up the sound, turn it up loud

Shout, let your feelings out
Fasten your seatbelts, light up the smoke


One way up we go



And we're flying through the night away...



And we're flying through the night away...

At the speed of light

And we'll find a place we'd love to stay



You got to hold on tight

Crank up the sound, turn it up loud

It's a magical carpet ride

Scream and shout, let your feelings all out


Get your spirits high


And we're flying through the night away...



And we're flying through the night away...

Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be

Human beings fight to evolve

Where the birds of freedom
Spread their wings up high
Everyone is looking to America

Is going through a big change
For better or for worse?
The question still remains

Unemployment shooting high
Immigration on the rise

We're livin' in a mad world
And that's the bloody truth
We're livin' in a bad world

Lost in a dream of virtual reality
A battle-film and some booze
Ain't got no time for ecology

And I'm gonna sit back close to you again
Rushes through my body, quivers up my spine
This feeling when I see your curves of desire

Your gentle looks can kill, so full of lust within
Let me caress your flesh, unveil your passion, turn you on
It's the night of the snakes

X-rated scenes ahead, time to put the kids to bed
Explore the mysteries of our bodies
Release some tension from this moral flesh
Lick one hundred beads of sweat

One is a beggar in rags
One is a victim of circumstance
One is a queen dressed in black

One for all, all for one
Now won't you give 'em a dime?
One for all, all for one

One is a veteran soldier
One is a man of the cloth

Without the cure, without your love, so blue
Can't wait to see your face again
Only you can stop the pain
Girl my love has never been so true

An open fire, a great desire
It's an open fire in my heart
Open fire, burning desire
Open fire in my heart

Can't wait to see ya
Let's find a place where we can be alone
Somewhere to share the passion, free our feelings
I want to touch and hold you for my own

I've waited long for this love
To unfold the secrets from within

At the end of the day

Life is hell, no peace for the wicked
Where evil rules the game
Spreads like a wildfire and burns you down
We've gotta fight it, gotta stamp out the flame

Raise your hands for a better world
Raise your hands and let your voices be heard
Raise your hands if you want a better world
Raise your hands, I say that truth is the word

I know I'm not alone
I look in your face
Can see her sparkling shine of innocence
I'm in the best right place

Life has its burdens, too much pain
She can be a cold bitch

And let her make us all rich

Where evil rules the game
Spreads like a wildfire, destroys all dignity

Krokus,"I saw her walkin' down the street
My heart jumped up and missed a beat
Boy, she looked sharper than an arrow
Her skirt too short and really narrow

No risk, no gain
But I must have made a pass too plain
Her hand came flyin' and it really was a shame

Well, I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop
Yes, I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top

Next day I saw her in the park
If I was a dog I would have barked
In a pink bikini by the lake
Her perfect body lay to bake

No risk, no pain
And I must have blocked her sun away
Cold ice came flyin' and it landed on my face

Well, I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop

As the whole world stood still

How can I forget that prayer for the dead
Underneath that blackened sky
As close as we could get

A dark sign of the times
Can't let the madness
Kick us down to the ground

We'll shine in the night
We'll rise, we'll shine
From the ashes of eternity

We'll rise, we'll rise

Another silver moon
And soon the sun will shine

How do you rate me?
Poorly or greatly?
Everybody seems to be goin' for their's lately
Yo mad heads be needin' money
So listen very close as I conduct this little study
See it's, funny to me, you can watch TV
And give up your life trying to be all you can be
In the Army
Not knowin' your history
You either fight and die or come back home in misery
Yo get with me, I deal with reality
Loosen your mind to the truth, and don't get mad at me
No politician can give you peace
If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast?
Emancipation is long over due
So overcome procrastination
Because freedom is within you
For some reason we think we're free
So we'll never be
Because we haven't recognized slavery
You're still a slave, look at how you behave
Debatin' on where and when and how and what Massa gave
You want to know how we screwed up from the beginning?
We accepted our oppressor's religion
So in the case of slavery it ain't hard
Because it's right in the eyes of THEIR God
Where is our God, the God that represents us?
The God that looks like me, the God that I can trust?
A God of peace and love, not mass hysteria
I don't want a God that blesses America
I could never really vote for the devil
Let me take you to a higher level

Title, take the title from the Bible we can get there
Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there
Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries
Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughing and drinking and singing and
Kissing me
I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke
I like to ask these politicians would Jesus vote?
The way we view God is a freakin' shame
Church is to blame
We trust God, but bomb Hussein
We simply lovin' the scripture
Same scripture that whipped 'cha
Sooner it'll hit 'cha
Religion's gettin' richer
With that European version of Christ made into a picture
Our society's gettin' sicker, and sicker, and sicker...
Like liquor, we are God-Intoxicated
Not to the true God, but the one the government created
The same governments tellin' people to vote
I pray to God because the people have lost hope
You either vote for the mumps or the measels
Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil
Politics and God are not equal
But the education if you don't guard, is really lethal
People have more respect for a holy book
Than they do for a cow on a meat hook
Believers of Jesus be denouncing Satan on every level
But every Halloween they're dressin' like devils
I pray to you for the light you might give them
Mother make them know that you're livin' with them
You begin them and end them in silence
Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence
I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican
Have mercy Mother, cause I know that you're mad at them
The White Jesus deceived us awhile ago
And Pope Julius the Second paid Michaelangelo
I know this happened in 1519 yet
This is the image we can't seem to forget
Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil

But I can't get out of it and I can't seem to wake up
So I'm runnin and racin, blunt smokers are chasin
This is insane, I'm caught by House of Pain
I'm picked up, they said they gonna Put My Head Out
They slit my back and all the tobacco fell out
Now I'm hollowed wet thin and yes ready
They poured the shumpang gently and re-wet me
I'm in the mouth yo, I can't wake up
Yo I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

Check it out now, in the same attire here comes the fire
OW they lit it, now I'm burnin by the minute
But check it out, more heads came to chill
Everlast took a pull and passed me to Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill took a pull, lungs are full
Who's next? I'm bein passed to Das EFX
As they took a mad pull, smoke blows in heaps
It's really smoky but I can still see Black Sheep
Whoa! Black Sheep gets me, relights me
Room is proper, now I'm passed off to Shabba
Shabba's voice gets low like a tuba
He said, ""Me no follow no rumor"" and passed me to Grand Puba
I wasn't burnin right so Puba got mad at me
And said, ""Who rolled this?"" and passed it to Kid Capri
Kid Capri said, ""I won't front!
Pass it to Redman, he knows how to roll a blunt""
Redman said, ""No need to re-roll""
He hit, relit it, and passed me to De La Soul
De La Soul took a hit and kept hittin
Now they're buggin cause they passed me to Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton said, ""I'll smoke but I won't inhale
I'll only hit it twice,"" he got slapped by Greg Nice
Now I fell on the floor, Greg Nice picked me up
I'm bein smoked and I can't wake up

I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

Get me out of this, somebody wake me up
I'm still on fire and I'm still bein smoked up
Half my body is gone, now they're comin to my head
Now my head is being pinched by Teddy Ted
A crazy nightmare I got to go
I got to wake up and I'm passed off to Yo-Yo
Yo-Yo gets respect as a lady
She didn't smoke, she passed me to Showbiz & A.G
A.G. said, ""Respect due seen""
He got one big pull and passed me to Smooth B
Smooth B, although he's talking to Teddy
Took a hit and passed me to Fab 5 Freddy
Freddy said, ""Yo! There's nothing left pop""
Looked at me in my face and passed me to Chubb Rock
Chubb Rock said, ""Yo Freddy chill!
If you ever catch me smoking, just kick me in the grill""

I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

I'm dreamin'",I Can't Wake Up
KRS-One,"Justin is the pimp on the block 
He smacks and cracks around hoes a lot
Every day around three o'clock 
You can hear all the nasty talk
He loves the disease infested little whores
Whose mouths and things are covered with herpes sores
He brags to the public about how he scores
With 12 year old girls behind convenience stores
His brain is gone from smoking crack
He lost his hair, it won't grow back
He carries around a burlap sack
And searches around for a needle to slap
He's a drug addicted little boy
Who infests your town with disease
Don't play around with his toy

I be chillin' wit the
I'm rollin' wit the

See, this is what I'm sayin' and I know you don't see this
Wack, underpriveledged MCs think they can see Kris
They watchin' too much television and they rocka
This ain't the TV show ""Taxi,"" and I ain't Lotka
I break an MC off proper, yo don't check me
Ask your Moms and Pops, yo they respect me
But here you stand, tryin' to get yours, but gettin' nothin'
You probably can't spell ""Boogie Down"" or ""Productions""
I play for jeeps, I play for keeps, I play for streets, believe me
Put down the microphone and consider a squeegie
You're rated PG
Again I win when I begin
I'm slammin' again, no win, try to comprehend
I don't bend
I ravage and damage
I'm wild like a savage, kickin' asses
Hot flashes, your style's with trash's
Stay out of my classes, PUNK
Stay out of my classes - yo

[Chorus]

Twinkle, twinkle to the little rap star
I got all type of MC tongue in a pickle jar
So here's a quick freestyle to my target:
My core audience, *fuck* the rest of the market!
'Cause I spark it, styles I loan shark it
Then break your legs if you try to chart it
I got heart, it
Doesn't take a lot to rock a record, get wit it
Some MCs can't rock for five minutes
Sorry, that's not the way to approach me
Use caution
I rip up lyrical crews and MCs often
You probably don't know this:
I give birth to MCs
And I also give abortions
I'll do a number to your body structure
You look like supper
And I'm that hungry motherfucker!
You don't want to be on the menu!
I'll end you, twist you up and bend you
Like Gestapo
Pick up the microphone and crush up MC like a taco
No, we're never sad because we nah deal with sorrow
That's why dem challenge me, jah man you know dem challenge trouble
Me are number one of me there is no double!
And you don't want no trouble
'Cause Blastmaster KRS is flashin' lyrics on the double

[Chorus]

Check
Me comin' on quick, me cominadance, now me a sing
KRS-One in a party, man me do me own ting
Nuff MC test, but you don't hear vowel one
All you hear is when the BDP crew slap them up
We have the champion belt and lyrical cup
Any DJ they want my title filled, no way now man step up
But when you lose, now understand you get fucked up
This ain't no game upon the mic
Me bring the noise to you like Chuck

Are you tired of lyrical liars, passing fliers
Wannabe MC's, but really good triers
Tripping over mic cords, getting you bored
A total fraud, this kind of thing I can't afford, so I
pick up the mic and kill it ill it top bill it
The cough is a skillet, where MC's get fried in it
You got beef chill it, blood I spill it
After seven long years of ripping the party and I'm still widdit
You call my name I don't think about suing ya
I come to the club with that BOOYAKA
Laughing while I'm doin ya the crowd is booin ya
Gimme one month, record for record on tape I'll ruin ya

I rock the African, the European, and Jap
Beneath I got to show you that I am all that
So I must, roc, the mic

Of course yeah I'm the most brilliant recording artist in your life
Never have to repeat a rhyme style twice, precise
In a lyrical drought like water to your lips oh yes my lyrics will suffice
I'm nice, like beans and rice, I am delicious
Who's the freshest lyricist on the mic, you don't want to fuck with Kris is
Lyric for lyric rhyme for rhyme style for style I break you like dishes
Either you come fully correct or the lyrics you simply makin wishes
We got no time for fake black leaders and dreamers blowin wishes
youse a fraud, I mean a fraud like in fraudulation
I know what it is, the crown of rhyme supremacy you're tastin
And yes, before the flavor hits your greedy tongue
You get ripped up by KRS-One
Now, lyrics, somebody want lyrics, from the lyrical terrorist
Here's a little somethin for you all to remember Kris, and remember this
I am no pessimist, more of an optimist
Activist revolutionist, yes the hardest artist
And the smartest, Premier, spark this

MC's get ate, get broken like a pretzel
and get dissed if they ever try to step to
They can't take a MC with loose lips
Talk a lotta shit [but sink no motherfuckin' ships]
Lyrics make bigger holes than hollow tips
Watch another rapper body get stiff
Just like in church, we pass the basket
as I preach over his casket
Fuck it, kick the body right over
and say ""See ya, hmm, nice to know ya""
Got another rapper to see
Yo Kris, bust that ass [certainly]

If you're shiverin' get off the pot
Let the original rapper rock the spot
You stand there and jock, goin' [mumbles]
This is absolutely ludicrous, what can you do to Kris
Chattin' foolishness, step along quick with that stupidness
It's me rippin' this for self, where else ya lookin'?
I got more rhymes than all the Jamaicans in Brooklyn
So beat it or be seated, Gee I'm mad undefeated
Young boy, you can't see me, run along and make pee-pee
I was rockin' rhymes when ""La-Di-Da-Di"" was a demo
Admit you been on my tip for years and just can't seem to let go
Go, go call your mother, tell her you want to battle KRS quick
I bet the minute you get home you'll get your ass whipped
Crazy ill mad styles is what I give 'em
Not a run-of-the-mill 'em, I drill 'em, I got ridiculous rhythm
None of my styles you can get with 'em
Still um, will um, your crew come get some so I can kill 'em

Well I roll by myself but don't let it fool ya
If I got beef my crew'll damn step to ya
We don't play no games, I'll come straight to your rest
Lift up your shirt and blast you in your chest
[Well that was fresh]

A fad doesn't fill the bill, but mad skills will
Don't let me have to kill you kid, god forbid still
Greed will lead your need to succeed
but your speed, your speech
Your outreach is a breach of what I teach
For lyrical styles you're a leech
If I was Spanish I'd say, [""You lie like a beech""]
Wow-wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow...
Wow, for a amateur you really looked hard
But you're really a bitch, when you get it together
call me, here's my card
Check the list: you lack breath control, mental behavior
Lyrical talent, imagination and flavor
I got no time for amateur rhyme, you could be hurt
Thinkin' you're hard because you wear a gangsta T-Shirt
I'll smash your want to-be ass in the deep dirt
Black, you'll come up dizzy sayin' ""How da fuck he do dat?""
'cause you're yappin' like you can't be reached
If your name ain't Arrested Development, well save your speech
Time to ill, I got mad skills to fill
Not a fake, I got more styles than Drake's got Tasty Cakes
Gotta be the best Gee, don't try to test me
You'll get jacked son, even if your name is not Jesse
Let's be up front when I meet ya
Peace, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' teacher

When we come in all de dance 'nuff D.J.'s shut up, woy!

KRS-One,"Bo!  Boom bye bye, hip-hop will never die
Despite the fact that I'm fly I'm never dry
You could beat me, cheat me, when you meet me try to defeat me
But nevertheless you'll have stress, cause I don't rest
You want to know what my problem is, if you're curious??
I take this hip-hop shit too serious!!
I forget that other rappers ain't true to this
So when they grab the mic I get hyped like LET'S DO THIS!!
All my rhymes are fat, while rappers are skimpy, wimpy
So I simply chew they crew like a Blimpie
Skip me when you dissin, skip me when you on a ego mission..
I blow up, like nitroglycerin!
You better tune in to Teddy Ted
""Yo stop frontin', and use your head""

Well if you ain't called it hip-hop, there's a door, I ain't stoppin
I got more flavors than Baskin Robbins!
I flash the funky fresh flavors force-fully
Freak the phonies and flip philosophy constantly (true!)
That reminds me, rappers rock drip-drop
Not hip-hop, they want to SING and all dem ting
Thank God KRS is still rappin; all that ""ooh I love you baby""
and ""blink blink blink"" - this ain't happenin

Yo this is curtains for these rappers that be frontin on the next man
Lookin down at brothers just because they gettin checks and
haven't got a skill but they're LARGE on the hum-bum
You want to step to Kid Capri, COME COME COME!!
I break em up, just for actin like a superstar
Around the way, we got a neighborhood trooper car
We ride by, and spray your crew, and your honies too
And rip you open and drink your blood like a Mountain Dew

I descend to lend a friend a helping hand
to stop a trend, again and again and again, I just can't say when
I beg to confess my sins to other men
Reverands guard lips, within there I'll begin
I'll always win, over-sakin
The party is ripped, without a hit or with a hit I'm rippin shit
You must admit, I'll never quit the lyrics I flip
I'm tough like licorice, battlin Kid Capri?  It's ridiculous
We come to the party inconspicuous..",Stop Frontin'
KRS-One,"You ain't that tough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end 

You walk around the town like you a big man
But you never know now that there's always a bigger man
You sling the M-16 and flash the M-1
But you don't know what you're doing never learned to handle one
But true! All you friend thinking you a gangster
While your mother tried to warn you from certain danger
So when you in your room you playing with your Mac-10
Fully loaded automatic, just you and a friend
You posing aw dey mirror like you a gangster clown
But the Mac-10 go off and you friend go down

Uh oh! What you gonna do now?
Uh oh! They gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh! Tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh! Look, they cutting you away

Your father telling you ""Now son just go to school
Don't go acting like a fool and don't go acting too cool""
You get to the school and meet up with the right bunch
Just a group of kids with no names taking people lunch
You join the click because you want to meet some girls
And you want a little prestige in you little school world
One day you're walking with your crew along the road
And a member of your crew pull out a gun and unload
He shoot a parked car and all you run far
You and your friends laughing like you a superstar
And you get home and you thinking it was fresh
And a cop meet you there with a warrant for your arrest
Them ask, ""Who shot the gut why you walking down the street
Didn't you see the little boy there in the back seat sleep?
Now the boy dead we want to know from you
Who shot the car up, are we gonna take you?""

Uh oh! Now what you gonna do now?
Uh oh! Boy, them gonna blame you
Uh oh! Now tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh! Look, they cutting you away

You ain't that tough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end 

White kids! You living in the whitest part of town
You are a white kid but you know you hang around
So you and your friends thinking that you are all of that
When you see a youth walk by and yes the youth is black
One kid say ""Hey, what you doing on the block
We don't want no niggers here unless he is a cop""
So the kid pull out a big baseball bat
And them him slap with the bat because the kid is black
Now then the kid fell down but still alive
So he reach in his pants and pull out a four-five
Pop! One friend drop and everyone run
Out of all the white kids now you the only one
You start cry, cause now you gonna die
And it's all because what your friends did to this guy

Uh oh! What you gonna do now?
Uh oh! He gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh! What you think you gonna say?
Uh oh! Now them cutting you away

Check!

You ain't that tough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end 

You ain't that tough ya

You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end",Uh Oh

Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around

So here I go kickin science in ninety-five
I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
Roamin through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Wack MC's have only one style: gun buck
But when you say, ""Let's buck for revolution""
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY!
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK!
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO!
That's for calling my sister a hoe, and for you
BUCK BUCK BUCK, cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
you black people still thinkin about vot-ing
Every president we ever had lied
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died!

[Chorus]

This is not the first time I came to the planet
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin to like
get wit you, showin you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form,  I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
and enters into Kwame Ture

[Chorus]

In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
the devil cannot see through as I unload
into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
and leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin up static
Makin you a naked body, attic and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic

[Chorus]",Ah-Yeah

Ah hah hah, heh heh heh, EHHH

Some fear de 'matic, yes de automatic

While KRS-One, holds the minds of the children
I'm buildin' a followin' of a hundred and forty-four thousand
Chosen few heads up in project housin'
A true rapper, street rapper, rappin' to the center

Kickin' Edutainment while you wait for your arraignment
Save it friend before your chest I cave it in
I got my way again, I'm classical like a fuckin' Harley Davidson
How do you think I kick a lyrical style no and you figure
It's simple, I'm a rap God, and youse a nigga

My reflex'll slap a wack rapper automatically
When you was home witcha mother, afraid of the dark
I was sleepin' out in Prospect Park
Eatin' one meal every 48 hours
Writin' dope rhyme styles that you now devour
Don't you realize, that I'm all about survival
I got only friends cause I KILLED all my rivals
Show up at the rhyme recitals, took they titles
From eighty-six to ninety-six completes my first cycle

De automatic, get de automatic
Disrespect, from MC's, me nah go have it
De automatic, get de automatic
Tonight a rapper gwan die

I spent 40 days, and 40 nights in the wilderness
I'm hard, from head to toe yo there ain't no killin' this
I wrote over 100 rap hooks
and sociological books, while you worried about your looks
Now you want to enter the dragon in sound
But I've got the live club show locked down
Platinum and gold don't hold in my arena
You gots to keep it real on the mic, when they see ya
I manifest, in the West the East and overseas
The vision in rap is wack, and I don't know of these
I represent New York to be specific
The South Bronx, but in Japan I'm still gifted
I grab a jet and land on your set, what the fuck?
Twenty bucks for a rap show is still, twenty bucks
I start from eighty-six, and bring you into ninety-six
No gimmicks, tricks or lip-sync lyrics

De automatic, get de automatic
Disrespect, from MC's, me nah go have it
De automatic, get de automatic
Tonight a rapper gwan die

Yeah yeah it's the God Fat Joe
Representin' the motherfuckin' South Bronx
With my nigga Kris, knockin' off frauds
Motherfuckers want to do what?
Big shout out to my nigga Kenny Parker

Every time you hear nigga, listen up sista

I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, ""You're a gangster""
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a be	-boy stance
Recognize moms I'm one of your sons I'm hip-hop
In the form of Channel Live and KRS-One
Representin MC's across America
She said, ""You're the one who be causin all that mass hysteria""

Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love

She said, ""I like it, that's why I jock it""
Then I said, ""You only on my back because I fill brother's pockets""
Got em drivin Benzes Jeeps and Rolls Royces
Attackin me will leave youth with no voices
The choice is yours not mine hang with me
I'll have you freestyle and bombin graffiti

Because he censors the uses of the metaphor
You can get the dick bum up
Because it's you that brings the, real horrorcore
Expenditures forgettin, gut from the poor

Why sure!  Back before we were born they sold us out
Yeah Dade Jackson we know what you about
Youse a Slave Mason, not a Free Mason
Before long the Goddess Tiamat through hip-hop you'll be facin
Don't start me, cause I be the, lyricist
At the nineteen ninety-nine millennium party held at Giza
Sayin he's a, fraud, oh my Goddess
Never in your life should you disrespect an artist
Instead, focus your attention on astronomy
And the up and coming, shift in the economy
If you can't do that, then heed the final call
To free Mumia, Abu-Jamal

Hate to be so rough, it could be the White Owls
House niggaz are full of crap, like my Colin Powell
Kickin vowels, is how we relieve the tension
Until we start to bounce white people like suspension (revolution)
You paint the pictures, the black man on the corner
But tell me, who blew up Oklahoma?
The City, ain't no pity, for the beast
It's Hakim that voice from the East

[Chorus]

Buck buck!  Buck buck buck!
It sound like gunshots but it could be the plot
Of a chicken, definition, is what you're missin and
Listen to your children instead of dissin em
Senator Dole doesn't understand the young people
Like they be sayin want to, but we be sayin want to
They gettin dumber every summer as they walk the rope
Maybe because they cannot understand the quotes

Word, in actuality, this Norman Bates mentality
Always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
For degrees full circle, dead from the purple
Rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins, cause the trick of technology
A revelation, revelations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm Audi hundred forty four thousand with my people

From Caligula to Hitler, now it's Schwartzeneggar
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf
I sit in disbelief as he crawls underneath
The rock cock back the glock, cause I don't trust
The Devil I rebel until Babylon is dust

[Chorus]",Free Mumia
KRS-One,"Yeah.. yeah.. yup!
You know what?  I was just downstairs
And I was on my way up here to the studio and
A guy bumped into me and
And he said.. he said, ""Yo Kris!
How is it that you stay in this music?
You know, this rap music ex-specially for SO.. LONG.. SO.. LONG""
I said, ""Well you know years ago I made a deal with the Goddess""
He said, ""The Goddess?""
I said, ""Well yeah, you might know her as God
But I know her as the Goddess""
The universal mother
The mother of everything you see in existence
I ax-ked her for assistance
In lyrical persistence
And she gave it to me, under one condition
She said, ""I'll give you the gift
But use the gift to uplift""
I said, ""Okay mom!""

So I tell you the truth, really
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself

In the beginning was the word, the word was made flesh
Knowledge K. Reigns R. Supreme S.
Some of us guess while others of us are blessed
Take heed to the word, that I manifest
I manifest the future, the present, followed by the past
Everything in nature, rules by kickin ass
What they tellin me, but yo, you a friend to me
So I'ma tell you the secrets of MC longevity
Secret one: if it ain't fun, you're done
And about your career, huh, well choose another one
If you don't like what you do, you're through
Lesson two: make sure you got a dope crew
Not some crew, that's like an anchor on a shoe
A MAD CREW, that's of some benefit to you
Lesson three, might be contradictory or funny
But MC's should have OTHER WAYS of gettin money
That's to say learn other things beside music
Make money elsewhere, Hip-Hop you won't abuse it
Too many MC's, just emcee
So their longevity, is based on an Uncle Tom
At the record company
Lesson four: sell your image, never sell a record
Image is respected, records come and go
And get collected
Even the records of platinum artists, that used to rip shop
Can be bought, for a quarter at the thrift shop
Which brings me to lesson number five, the illusion
Has me thinkin, the minute they drop a record
They'll be cruisin, in the Acura
Slow down!  You're still a amateur
What separates the pro from the amateur is stamina
Not how long you can rhyme, but how long you've been rhymin
Changin with the times, and findin yourself
Still CLIIIIIIIIIIIIMbin for wealth
Blow for blow, you're still growin, still showin
(all knowin) now that's a pro at it

Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself

Thank you Mother, I'm out","Health, Wealth, Self"
KRS-One,"Alright, here we go

I'm thinkin' real hard about some money I can hold
But everybody I know is deep in the hole
A steady payin' job is too hard for me to hold
I call around for work but they puttin' me on hold
But in my hand a shiny .45 is what I hold
I make a mayonnaise sandwich out of some whole-
Wheat, I'm feelin' weak, I can't hold
I gotta rob somebody tonight and take the whole
Bank roll, some cash I gotta hold
At the bottom of my shoe is a little bitty hole
That's it, my mental sanity I can't hold
I'm walkin' to the store with this pistol that I hold...

Half of me is sayin' maintain and uphold
Suddenly I bump into some asshole
He's cursin' me out, but this pistol that I hold
Took control, and in his head I put a hole
Ahhh man, now I'm lookin' around the whole
Area, the gun is still hot that I hold
I'm buggin' out, and I don't know how much longer I can hold
I feel myself sinkin' deeper in the hole
So in my victim's pants I rip a little hole
And felt for the wallet, and took the whole
Bill-fold, forty bucks is what I hold
Suddenly I hear, ""Freeze! Police! Hold!""

In the penitentiary I see a whole
Bunch of blacks and Hispanics that they hold
In my cell I cry like hell, my head I hold
One day somebody ax if my shoes they could hold
I told this guy, ""Listen! My shoe's got a hole
But what's up with that shiny sharp knife that you hold?""
He lunged forth, the first thing that I thought of was to hold
The arm with the knife so that he couldn't put a hole
In me, but then I put him in a chokehold
Took the knife and in his neck I put a hole
Suddenly all the C.O's come to me and it's me they hold
Beat my ass and I spend two weeks in the hole
I'm ready to bug out, my sanity I can't hold
My needs and wants messed up my life on a whole.

Damn. Just wasn't satisfied with life.

The moral to the story is...your addiction to your needs and your
wants is what causes problems in your life. Make sure you got whatcha
need. Put at a safe distance all the things that you want. It's wants
that get you into trouble.

This is the balance of life, the balance to life on a whole.",Hold

Historically speakin, cause people be dissin
The first graffiti artists in the world were the Egyptians
Writing on the walls, mixing characters with letters
to tell the graphic story about their life, however
today we do the same thing, with how we rap and draw
We call it hardcore, they call it breakin the law
There used to be a time when rap music was illegal
The cops would come and break up every party when they see you
But now the rap music's making money for the corporate
It's acceptable to flaunt it, now everybody's on it

Fresh.. for nineteen-ninety-five
You SUCKERS!!!!",Out for Fame
KRS-One,"Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth

I lived in a spot called millbrooke projects
The original criminal minded rap topic
With twenty cents in my pocket I saw the light
If you're young gifted and black, you got no rights
Your only true right, is a right to a fight
And not a fair fight, I wake up wonderin' who died last night
Everyone and everything is at war
Makin' my poetic expression hardcore
I ain't afraid to say it, and many can't get with it
At times in my life, I was a welfare recipient
I ate the free cheese, while the church said believe
And went to school everyday, like a god damn fool
Well anyway, here I am, chillin' at the party
Brothers lookin' at me like they want to kill somebody
A cypher manifested in the center of the jam
I got to show these wack rappers really who I am
It's me against them, so I clear the phlegm
And wage the war, hardcore to the end
For someone lookin' inside, yeah from the out
It seems like disrespect is what rap is all about
But hip-hop as a culture, is really what we give it
But sometimes the culture contradicts how we live it
Cause every black kid lives two and three lives
The city's a jungle, only the strong will survive

Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth

Every single day I hear lie after lie
Like ""black people don't die, we multiply""
So when I kick a rhyme I represent how I feel
The sacred street art of keepin' it real
Why I gotta listen, to somebody else?
How they got wealth, let me talk about myself
But all I really got is hip-hop and a glock
The results are obvious, if I'm confined to my block
Occasionally, in the city I'm released
To meet other beasts, lookin' for the feast
We grunt and growl, on the prowl, as the air gets thinner
""yo yo there he go, him,"" there's the dinner
White meat, carryin' a bag of some sort
Life is short, white meat is quickly caught
A scuffle a muffle yet none of us hesitated
Like mother africa, white meat is violated
We quickly disappear, like santa's little elves
And go into a area to fight amongst ourselves
We say, ""peace/piece"" cause that's what we really want
A piece of the pie that america flaunts

Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth

The truth is that police must serve and protect
Reality is black youth is shown no respect
The truth is government has a war against drugs
Reality is government is ruled by thugs
With all this technology, above and under
Humanity still hunts down one another
Rappers display artistic cannibalism
Through lyricism, we fight each other over rhythm
Through basic animal instincts, we think
So the battle for mental territory is glory, end of story

Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth

KRS-One,"Blastmaster Kris, I don't talk ish.
Expand your consciousness and dismiss foolishness.
No one is new to this or new to Kris.
In hip-hop's atomic structure I am the nucleus.
That is the center of the group we, us.
They, them, you, every squad, every massive, every crew.
Dental floss is lost when a true rapper jumps off.
The cash is incidental, but not mental distract you off course.
The style that I am kickin' is like chicken.
It will be bitten, rewritten, then performed for a twenty-five dollar admission;
Reviewed in The Source.
You will listen, then find somethin' missin' of course... it's skills;
That's what you're fishin' for, it's lost.
I'm gettin' too explicit; the track jingles.
I won't do a wack album, then remix it for my single.
Kickin' rhymes till I wrinkle, and my brown eyes twinkle.
God called hip-hop for the nine-cinco.

Tasty like a soufflé french croisant on Tuesday.
Rappers be boo-tay.
Goo-fy, that's how they crew stay;
Bitin' whatever you say to boost they ego.
We know the steelo; your whole character is foul.
Makes me want to shoot a free throw; blaow!
From the git go, no, get go, my flow hits low.
Wherever all the dope shit go; there's where my shit go.
Bee-dee-bee-bo, skank, I think;
Self with ya groups, everyone else, and the bank.
Others like to bring the shottie to the party;
I bring knowledge of self; you cure the mind; you cure the body.
Some rappers like to come to the party hopin' to leave with somebody.
Check, I come with skills, and I leave with your motherfuckin' respect.
Ahh yeah... so check, uh!

New types of verbal hip-hop I bring.
When you know you can sing, boy, you know you can sing.
I do not clutter up the airwaves with stacks of useless facts.
MC's trying to be macks, but acts like ignorant blacks;
Freak that, I'll snap your back as it cracks.
You will experience loss or lack of balance.
Stop the violence; fry from week to week like an allowance.
All of you are cowards; hiding behind the mask of MC.
I remember, thinkin' back to eighty-three;
No video; no you had to be a real, live, MC.
Now you younguns grow up buggin' any new jock you're huggin'
Weak production; let me tell you somethin'.
Any MC can battle for glory,
But to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people's another story.

violence in society would be a minimal
Cause the education yeah, would now be metaphysical
Not livin by laws, but livin by principal
If you disobey, the UNIVERSE gets with you
We would study giving so no one would steal
And we would read each other's magnetic fields

You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
""Yo Kris you hit too hard"" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is ""Who let the K out?""
?No great area?
Everything is black and white we took the gray out it's scarier
Either you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin
I'm droppin a lot in your noggin
Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so
You know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One
is the holder of a boulder yo, money folder yo
You want a fresh style let me show you slow
your blow, I'm not your foe
Battling me?  No no no no no no NO!

South South, Bronx

Raw rhymes for raw times
My albums are underground, but this blessing is all mine
And when it's tour time, we open more minds
You need to rethink who you think is the ""Greatest of All Time""
I got this -- I'm raw like Freddie Foxxx is
Hardcore like The LOX is, Scott LaRock is where Tupac is
Where hip-hop is, Digital-ly Underground like Shock is
Oh yes -- I know where the top is
But I'd rather rhyme about how crooked some of these cops is
My synopsis ain't pretty
I'd stay, off them plains and, out the city if I were you
Do what you gotta do
But while you wave them flags, remember Amadou Diallo
Here's what we gotta do, follow
I'll put hip-hop in you if you're hollow
Those that already filled, still take swallows
Goin over potholes with Tahoes
You don't think +I+ know? Huh! I'm lookin at you right now
You ain't dancin in the club, you in your car, sittin down
You in the crib, on the low
You got them headsets on the go
You just saw me at the show oh you don't know?
It's the Temple of Hip-Hop, comin, with a whole different flow
Yo where them hoes at? I don't know
But wherever God at, I'ma go
I give 'em a hard rap and a flow
That's why when they call back for the show, with no video
We get up and go

Yo where it started at?

Peep it out while I tell ya like this
In every single hood in the world I'm called Kris
It's the, truth for ya, it's the proof for ya
My Cristal passes more bars than lawyers
The underground sound, this is not easily found
You don't need no rings to be down
This is, past the platinum and gold
We already had 'em, it's old
Here's the truth if it be told, gather 'round
Philosopher style is known to be wild
If you only holdin them guns, who's holdin your child?
You got to be thinkin you know that you shrinkin
When the art of Navigation has been reduced to a Lincoln
Change the dial! I was free then and I'm free now
You free, runnin to MTV? I don't see how
You know the real from the fake, you know they stealin they cake
You know it ain't about the art, it's all about what they make
You know the radio's late, you know they play what you hate
That's why you got that Kay Slay tape, tryin to escape
You know the love of the cars and the rims
Tattooed arms and Timbs, are also called sins
You know you got to pay for these spins
You know the rap magazines be wack from beginning to the end

You my sister I'll be tryin to get you out of the bed

I don't fill you with lead, I bring that knowledge instead
Follow this dread, I'll take you from A to Zed
Who am I? Just a scholar called K-R-S
You can spend your money on others but they ain't blessed
You can spend your money drugs and still be stressed
Look around for conscious rappes yo there ain't none left
I'm holdin it downbetter yet I'm holdin up

KRS-One,"Anybody in here right now with tape decks turn em on
And put em on record, I'll give you a second
I want to add authenticity to your tape
So when it's sold out in the street
You all can know this was a real party

These are poems circulating throughout the nation
Everybody's bad and everybody's tough
But how many people are intelligent enough
To open up their eyes and see through the lies
Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive?
Not many
That's why the universe sent me today on this stage
With this to to say
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto
Let go, it's not a novelty
You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty
Follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter
There's no reason to fear the New World Order
We must order the whole new world to pay us
The New World Order and the old state chaos
The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see
Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society
But first you and I got to unify
Stop the negativity and control our creativity
The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?
Could it be we still thinking like niggas?
Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!",2nd Quarter-Free Throws

Count the truth poetic construction, audio abduction

Floatin' like a soap bubble that you don't wann puncture

Not succeeding still pursuing what you doing?

KRS-One,"Open a the herb gate selling pure ganja
Babylon come but they undercover
They never really want me stop sell ganja
(They just wanna take a cut of what you make so far!)
But I'm not having it, I load the SLR
Pack the ganja boom! They break down the door
Pop-pop! T'ree shots, exchanged at close range
Out of three Babylon, me hit one in the brain
Pop-pop! Two shots hit the window pane
I exchanged four shots, I drop and feel pain
but I'm not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window, it's a one story fall
I'm falling, hit the ground and start crawling
Soon I'm walking 'round, blending in with the crowd
Another day, I got away, I gotta fix this problem someday
But the very next day

Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)
Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)

I'm in another herb gate like a superstar
Eleven A.M., things are safe so far
I used to worry 'bout the competition on the block
But now the competition on the block is the cops
And even block watch doesn't know where we lay
Well (""Open up! It's the D.E.A.!"")
Aww man, just when I went for more lead
The door opens up, I got a glock to my forehead
(""Get down! Get on the floor!"") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead
But I woke up instead in a cell laying on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound
Two D.T.'s came in and laid they glocks down
One was whistling a love song, as he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn something's wrong
Boom bap! Boom bap against my head
I fell back on the bed, down to his feet
The pain was insane but the hit was sweet
Cause these dumb-ass cops punched me right by the heat
The glock, two shots, three shots they screaming
Then someone said (""Hey wake up kid, you're dreaming!"")
I said, ""Yo dreaming?! That nightmare was hell""
But as I look around, I was still in my cell
Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam
The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?!
I wiped the saliva, off my mouth
The D.T. said.. (""Let's make a deal"") No doubt!
No question, now we started up the session
No need for guessing, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher?
He said.. (""Don't be a God damned liar!"")
You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me
But still the cops you knocked off yea was dirty
Now the whole investigation is federal
We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal
He continued to say, you can't think it through
This whole drug game is BIGGER than you!
Follow our plan man and you'll be free
Let me explain one thing so you can see, we

Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)
Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)

Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up
Constantly thinking about being tied up
Snap out of it, I'm thinking, ""Damn we like elves!
The federal and local cops got wars with themselves;
and I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle.
My nose is runny"" (""Let me get a 20!"")
A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown?
(""Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!"")
God damn, God damn, here we go again
But this time I'm set up by my federal friend
Suddenly I hear (""Yo, move from the door!"")
Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four
After the violence, then there was silence
Then I heard.. (""Hey yo it's us, open up the door!"")
But rule number one in this game is self-reliance
So I picked up the mini-mac in case they wanted more
The door opened up, the feds said what up?
They was sticking you up, so they had to get bucked
Suddenly a sense of trust came over me
I thought to myself, ""Well soon I'll be free!""
But as I turned around, I heard the gun go click
I said wait, but it was too late","Can't Stop, Won't Stop"

Hardcore lyric comin at ya they attackin ya
Rappers bite like Dracula the soul of hip-hop
I'm puttin back in ya, with the South Bronx vernacular
Bound to put the crack in your armor, I am much sharper
Than a lot of other mic rockers, slightly eccentric
But everything's authentic, when I said, ""I'm hip-hop,"" I meant it
Emcees want to debate the issue, but false though
If they studied they would see that they are hip-hop also
Hip-Hop you can't do it, you gots to be it
You can't confine it, you have to free it, so you can see it
As your expression, and learn the lesson, on life in ghetto sections
And what you feel is the forward direction
For black people, not these Star Wars save that for R2-D2
I got five fingers like Bruce Lee do
And with the five fingers I grab microphones and bring the
Stinger to DJ's, rappers, singers and beer drinkers
This MC's a thinker, unlike others but I won't diss yaz
You're still my brothers and sisters, Kris is
ONE aspect of hip-hop rap
Negative rap, positive rap, forget that black it's a trap
To set us back, concentrate on various rap talents
Presently the rap radio format is unbalanced
You either got the player, or the conscious rhyme sayer
All day, on your radio, not with a different flavor
Someone has to DIE before you hear a conscious record
People don't like gangsta rap, but conscious rap, they don't respect it
The truth is people are afraid of black youth
Our expressions, our lessons and gold teeth, so..

All I really need is a friend

If we can't have trust then you can't hang with us
We respond to those who show respect with respect
We respond we connect on the same deck

We could stand on the corner with a hat sellin toys

Until we blow the spot then they all want to crowd us
And want to shout us, but you my man from way back
I just gots to say that, actin large I don't play that
But I can't say that, where I play at isn't fast-paced
A friend can acquire the taste to become two-faced
And that's a disgrace there ain't nothing you can say to us
When the kid you grew up with betrays your trust
When we used to ride the bus we had trust
Now we cash checks and drive Lex, and can't show respect to one of us
Yo the heads I hang with ain't tryin to just get
What they can get, sit quickly backstabbin the click
I roll thick, but only some are friends really
Down to the end, my right hand men and women

Thumpin, between the crew we always got sump'un
But if we had nuttin no frontin whatever
We'd still be crew you and me, me for you together

You caught up in the image and, don't know they rhymes
You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is
Fat Joe's a leader, Busta Rhymes a preacher

But through Cassidy my lessons are quicker to reach ya
We one community

Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter",I Got Next/Neva Hadda Gun

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

Again we start, let me say my part
About the only guy who has some heart
It took some time for the heart to come
But it's here, and everybody's in fear

Crashing through the door of that whore
Bringin’ a end to this gold chain war
What you saw, KRS-One is now seeing
Another fly human being

Making no excuses for the losers
Chain snatchers, pimps, drug abusers
You don't like it but you gotta keep pushing
Until somebody starts mushin'

All these suckers, claimin' to rule the environment
(Nah man, I ain't buyin' it)
You seem to think that everybody can be taught
That everyone else can be bought

But you took a short, 'cause one guy hasn't been paid
He is the Jack of Spades

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

He's a calm kind of guy, courageous and loyal
But don't let the temper boil
Cause just like a pot when the whistle blows
(That's right boy, anything goes)

The crime is committed and he's right on your tail
There's no bail, not thinkin’ 'bout jail
All the ends are justified by the means
When Jack's on the scene

Track the movement, don't lose it
Cause if he come through the back, he attacks
Crack, cocaine, cops, and more fiends
Who all get the same in the heat of this gold chain game

Here is the aim
Destroy all the stereotypes, hypes, and crack pipes
We don't like, criminals, and crime
But we don't pay it any mind

So here comes Kung Fu Joe, and Fly Guy
Slade, Hammer, and Slammer
I am a renegade teacher and scholar
If you ain't up on it you gotta

Fall to the back of the line
Hear this rhyme, cause I'ma say it one more time
It's Jack's theme song that KRS made
It's called the Jack of Spades

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

You know, the Jack of Spades is now down with the BDP posse
If you wanna see more, just watch me man
Do what I do, throw your hands in the air
And scream it out, oh yeah

(Oh yeah)
One more time
(Oh yeah)
(Flash the rhyme)

Cool, guy, loud and quiet
If your head's in the way, he'll fly it
Don't try it, cause Jack of Spades doesn't buy it
He's a one man riot

Cleanin' the community, of all its debris, the C-R-I-M-E
The road was long and scary and some didn't make it
The average guy couldn't take it

But Jack is not the average guy
He took a piece of the pie and bit it
Got with it, for his brother he did it
So you gotta admit it

This is a martyr, a soldier, a hero
Why? Because he started from zero
In this battle he clearly understands their power
They're payin' people by the hour

To sell, to lie, to try, to stand up and deny
They are gettin' everybody high
High on a cable, cash under the table
Currency is how they're able

To buy the cops and props and keep the law paid
But here comes the Jack of Spades

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

Break it down

Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

KRS-One,"What was it like to see
The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone.
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him
By coming home.
Moving me with a sound.
Opening me within a gesture.
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven.
It took so long to realize that
You hold the light that's been leading me back home.
Under a dead Ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light,
And wondering
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping, lost, and numb.
So glad that I have found you.
I am wide awake and heading home.
Hold your light,
Eleven.
Lead me through each gentle step by step
By inch by loaded memory.
I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows so we can
Reunite and both move on together.
Hold your light,
Eleven. Lead me through each gentle step by step
By inch by loaded memory
'Til one and one are one, eleven,
So glow, child, glow.

KRS-One,"Ya know that's why man I be telling you all the time man  you know 
LOVE  
That word love is a very serious thing  and if you don't watch out I 
Tell ya 
That (Love's gonna get you) because a lot of people out here say ""I 
Love my 
Car"" or ""I love my chain"" or or ""I'm I'm just in love with that girl 
Over 
There"" so far all the people out there that fall in love with material 
Items 
We gonna bump the beat a lil' something like this 
I'm in junior high with a be	 plus grade, 
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade, 
I walk from school to my moms apartment, 
I got to tell the sucaks everyday ""don't start it"", 
Cause where I'm at if your soft your lost, 
To say on course means to roll with force, 
A boy named Rob is chillin in a Benz, 
In front of my building with the rest of his friends, 
I give him a pound, oh I mean I shake his hand, 
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man, 
I go upstairs and hug my mother, 
Kiss my sister, and punch my brother, 
I sit down on my bed to watch some tv, 
(machine gun fire) do my ears deceive me, 
Nope, that's the fourth time this week, 
Another fast brother shot dead in the street, 
The very next day while I'm off to class, 
My moms goes to work cold busting her ass, 
My sisters cute but she got no gear, 
I got three pairs of pants and with my brother I share, 
See there in school see I'm made a fool, 
With one and a half pair of pant you ain't cool, 
But there's no dollars for nothing else, 
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf, 
Every day I see my mother struggling, 
Now its time I've got to do something, 
I look for work I get dissed like a jerk, 
I do odd jobs and come home like a slob, 
So here comes Rob he's cold and shivery, 
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery, 
I do it once, I do it twice, 
Now there's steak with the beans and rice, 
My mother's nervous but she knows the deal, 
My sister's gear now has sex appeal, 
My brothers my partner and we're getting paper, 
Three months later we run our own caper, 
My family's happy everything is new, 
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, 

[Chorus] 
That's why, (loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
You fall in love with your chain, 
You fall in love with your car, 
Loves gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind, 
So I want you to check the story out as we go down the line, 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 

Money's flowing, everything is fine, 
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine, 
Business is boomin' everything is cool, 
I pull about a g a week fuck school, 
A year goes by and I begin to grow, 
Not in height but juice and cash flow, 
I pick up my feet and begin to watch tv, 
Cause now I got other people working for me, 
I got a fifty five inch television you know, 
And every once in awhile I hear just say no, 
Or the other commercial I love, 
Is when they say, this is your brain on drugs, 
I pick up my remote control and just turn, 
Cause with that bullshit I'm not concerned, 
See me and my brother jump in the BM, 
Driving around our territory again, 
I stop at the light like a superstar, 
And automatic weapons cold sprayed my car, 
I hit the accelerator scared as fuck, 
And drove one block to find my brother was hit, 
He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring, 
And all I could think about was war and, 
Later I found that it was Rob and his crew, 
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, 
Ya know that's why, (loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(love loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
(love loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
That word love is very very serious(loves gonna get you) 
Very addictive 
My brothers out of it, but I'm still in it, 
On top of that I'm in it to win it, 
I can't believe that Rob would diss me, 
That faggot, that punk, he's soft a sissy, 
I'm driving around now with three of my guys, 
The war is on and I'm on the rise, 
We rolled right up to his favorite hang out, 
Said hello and then the bullets rang out, 
Some fired back so we took cover, 
And all I could think about was my brother, 
Rob jumped up and began to run, 
Busting shots hoping to hit someone, 
So I just stopped, and let off three shots, 
Two hit him and one hit a cop, 
I threw the gun down and began to shout, 
Come on I got him it's time to break out, 
But as we ran there were the boys in blue, 
Pointing their guns at my four man crew, 
They shot down one, they shot down two, 
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
(love loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
(love loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you), 
(loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
(love loves gonna get you) 
Ya know a lot of people believe that that word 
Love is real soft, but when 
You use it in your vocabulary like your addicted to it it sneaks right up 
And takes you right out. out. Out. Out. Out. 
So, for future reference remember it's alright to like or want a material 
Item, but when you fall in love with it and you start scheming and carrying 
On for it, just remember, it's gonna get'cha",Love's Gonna Get'cha (Material Love)

I'm not flammable 
I don't burn 
So please stop burnin' 
And learn to earn respect 
'Cause that's just what 
KR collects 
See, what do you expect

You got to have style 
And learn to be original

We stood up for the South Bronx 
And every sucka MC 
Had a response 
You think we care? 
I know that they are on the tip 
My posse from the Bronx is thick 
And we're real live 
We walk correctly 
A lot of suckas would like to forget me 
But they can't 
'Cause like a champ 
I have got a record 
Of knocking out the frauds in a second 
On the mic 
I believe that you should get loose 
I haven't come to tell you I have juice 
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level 
I'll be back 
But for now just seckle 

I'll play the nine 
And you play the target 
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it 
Or should I say, ""Start this"" 
I am an artist 
Of new concepts at their hardest 
Yo, cause I'm a teacher 
And Scot is a scholar 
It ain't about money 
Cause we all make dollars 
That's why 
I walk with my head up 
When I hear wack rhymes 
I get fed up 
Rap is like a set-up 
A lot of games 
A lot of suckas with colorful names

About hip hop 
About D-Nice, Melodie, 
And Scot La Rock 
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker 
Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker 
Some mc's be talkin' and talkin' 
Tryin' to show how black people are walkin 
But I don't walk this way to portray 
Or reinforce 
Stereotypes of today 
Like all my brothas 
Eatin' chicken and watermelon 
Talk broken english and drug sellin' 
See I'm tellin' 
And teaching real facts 
Now when some act in rap 
Is kind of wack 
And it lacks 
Creativity and intelligence 
But they don't care 
'Cause the company is sellin' it 
It's my philosophy 
On the industry 
Don't bother dissin' me 
Or even wish that we'd 
Soften, dilute, 
Or commercialize all our lyrics 
'Cause it's about time 
One of y'all hear it 
First-hand 
From the intelligent 
Brown man 
A vegetarian 
No goat or ham 
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger 
'Cause to me that's suicide

And what it meant to DJ Scot La Rock

It's all about reality

Kings just rule 
And most are never understood 
If you were to rule 
Over a certain industry 
Fuck right now 
Would be in misery 
No one would get along 
Nor sing a song 
'Cause everyone'd be singing for the king 
Am I wrong?! 
So yo, what's up 
It's me again

KRS, BDP again 
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend 
We're criminal minded 
And only tend 
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records 
No more than four minutes 
And some seconds 
The competition checks and checks 
And keeps checkin' 
They get the album 
Take it home 
And start sweatin' 
Why? well it's simple 
To them it's kind of vital 
To take KRS-One's title 
To them I'm like an idol 
Some type of entity 
In everybody's rhyme 
They want to mention me? 
Or rather mention us 
Me or Scot La Rock 
But they can get bust 
Get robbed, get dropped 
I don't play around 
Nor do I fuck around 
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around 
When some clown jumps up to get beat down 
Broken down to his very last compound 
See how it sound? 
A little unrational

Why is that? Is it because we're the minority?
Well, black kids follow me

Genesis chapter eleven verse ten
Explains the genealogy of Shem
Chem was a black man in Africa
If you repeat this fact they can't laugh at ya

Genesis fourteen verse thirteen
Abraham steps on the scene
Being a descendant of Shem which is a fact
Means, Abraham too was black

Abraham born in the city of a black man
Called Nimrod, grandson of Kam
Kam had four sons, one was named Canaan
Here, let me do some explaining

Abraham was the father of Isaac
Isaac was the father of Jacob
Jacob had twelve sons for real
And these were the children of Israel

According to Genesis chapter ten
Egyptians descended from Ham
Six hundred years later my brother read up
Moses was born in Egypt

In this era black Egyptians weren't right
They enslaved black Israelites
Moses had to be of the black race
Because he spent forty years in Pharaoh's place

He passed as the Pharaoh's grandson
So he had to look just like him
Yes, my brothers and sisters take this here song
Yo, correct the wrong

The information we get today is just wack
But ask yourself, why is that?

The age of the ignorant rapper is done
Knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone
The stereotype must be lost
That love and peace and knowledge is soft

Do away with that and understand one fact
For love, peace must attack
And attack real strong, stronger than war
To conquer it and its law

Mental pictures, stereotypes and fake history
Reinforces mystery
And when mystery is reinforced
That only means that knowledge has been lost

When you know who you really are
Peace and knowledge shines like a star
I've only shown you a simple fact
It takes a nation of millions to hold us people back

Which is wack but we can correct that
Teach and learn what it is to be black
'Cause they're teachin' birds to be a cat
But ask yourself homeboy, why is that?

Okay now, listen to this..
[Seagull sounds]
A mystical teacher sat by the seaside
It was about five o'clock cause we heard the free ride
Anyway; the teacher was talking in stride
Sitting upon a rock that was wide
And warning against false pride
""Come to where I reside!"" a woman cried
And the teacher replied, ""Do you serve your fish fried?""
""Yes,"" she replied, ""with potato salad on the side.""
And the teacher replied, ""Well where do you reside?""
She said, ""Up on the hillside, it's not a far ride.
If you came to have dinner, I would be so gratified.""
The teacher replied, ""It's six o'clock, seven o'clock, you decide.""
She replied, ""Seven o'clock, do you like stir-fried?""
She was mystified and felt so dignified
The teacher was coming to the house where she resides
So she purified with pesticides
[Chemicals sprayed; noise]
Called her friends up nationwide
[Phone being dialed]
Some of her friends were tongue-tied they felt so glorified
She made steamed fish, baked fish, fish that was fried
Soup, steamed vegetables, potato salad on the side
[Cooking food]
You could smell the bread in the oven far and wide
Natural juices and water purified
Organic fruits brought from the countryside
With silver forks and knives placed side by side
[Silverware clinks; noise]
You could not be dissatisfied;
Looking out the window staring at the mountainside,
You would have died
6:59 she's swollen with pride
As the moment intensified, there's a knock from outside
[Knocking at door]
She opens the door, for the teacher has arrived
[Door opening]
But to her surprise, it was a bum who cried
""Please, I smelt the bread from outside!
One piece,"" and then she replied
""The teacher is coming, he's soon to have arrived.
You're making me look bad, come on now, step aside!""
The bum then replied,
""When I say I'm hungry I haven't lied.
Give me some of that chicken that you just fried.""
[Food cooking]
She replied, ""Chicken - fried?
No that's for the teacher, you're not purified""
Then she slammed the door and went back inside
[Door closing]
Sat on the couch with the TV Guide
She looked at the clock, it was 7:09, then 7:30;
He still hasn't arrived
Eight o'clock, she's on the downside
Nine o'clock, by now she's teary-eyed
She's pissed off and her anger multiplied
She cried, then fell asleep dissatisfied
Next day she woke up, and was preoccupied
With meeting the mystical teacher who lied
Where could he hide?
She ran down by the seaside
[Seagull sounds]
He was there teaching about - false pride
""You lied!"" she replied, ""You lied!
You said you'd be there at seven o'clock, you lied!""
He replied, ""No I have not lied.
I came at 6:59, and you told me to move aside.
I asked for bread and the chicken that was fried.
[Food Cooking]
And you said, that I wasn't purified.""
She replied, ""I wasn't notified!
I had no idea that you was the bum that cried!""
And the teacher sighed, then replied, 
""This concludes our lesson on false pride.""",False Pride

What is a real hip-hop MC?
Is it MTV, is it BET?
Is it five m-i-see's 
So the people can see
I mean, how you think you're free 
When you act like property?
Tell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin
I mean rockin it live, not pickin his cotton
I mean adjustin his clothes, I mean how do you know
Before you come to the show that you're not gettin heated
That you're not gettin cheated
That you ain't come to the club thinkin 'I must've been weeded!'
(Word)
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
Ass they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas in a flick
When you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we bust off the gatler

[Chorus]

This is the ""Sneak Attack""
The ""Edutainment"" style returns like that
Take it off your shelf
Cause all we deal with is knowledge of self, health and wealth
Not Stealth bombers, leather goose bombers
Original hip-hop armor on cd-rom - eh
You got to get with a
21st century philosopher
Representin the religion of hip-hop, sir
Those that oppose are foes and will get rocked - eh
Stopped, eh, I rise like a helicopter
Like Zulu I'll Shaka, crowd
With a beat that's loud
Huh, I'm black and I'm proud - irrelevant
I'm black and intelligent
I teach my kids to watch the education they give em
Cause it's really all about street wisdom

[Chorus]

True hip-hoppers don't bleed
True hip-hoppers don't need
True hip-hoppers don't speed
No time for greed
True hip-hoppers do read
And will lead, not plead
Will sow seeds that breed
Ah-ha that's safer than weed, indeed
True hip-hoppers don't slave
True hip-hoppers don't crave
Silver and gold, we're not amazed
We live f-are-e-e
If you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me
My philosophy keeps it plain and simple
Here it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you
Or is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?
I'm ringin a bell within you
You only seek in a cell, that's what sin do
It tells you to put your craft on a menu, a chart
So they can sell you and your art

1987 I was at the Latin Quarters
Listenin to Afrika Bambaata give the order
The call of the order was to avoid the slaughter
He said, ""Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya!""
Without a lawyer, he taught The Infinity Lessons
In how hip-hop could be a, many a blessing
And that was great, so in 1988
There was no debate, we had to end the hate
The name of the game was ""Stop the Violence""
And unity, knowledge, and self-reliance
We - started talkin bout Martin and Malcolm
Had these ghetto kids goin, ""Huh, what about him?""
1989, Professor Griff speaks his mind
But his freedom of speech is declined
1990 came with the West coast
East coast, West coast, who is the best coast?
Lookin back now, of COURSE it was bogus
The whole argument was where we lost focus
We got hopeless; not with the lyrics and music
But with hip-hop, and how we used it
Or abused it, you know how the crew get
""You like it cause you choose it""
1991, we opened our eyes
With Human Education Against Lies, we tried
To talk about the state of humanity
But all these others rappers got mad at me
They called me ""Captain Human"", another message was sent
""Self Destruction don't pay the {fuckin} rent""
Remember that? Nobody wanted conscious rap
It was like - where these ballers at?
Where can they call us at? All was wack
Hip-Hop culture was fallin flat and that was that
So in 1992, I found my crew
They said, ""Yo Kris, what you wanna do?""
I said, ""Damn - why they wanna get with me?
If I bust they {shit} I'm contradictory.
If I play the bitch role, they take my shoe.
Tell me what the {fuck} am I supposed to do?""
So I did it, don't stop get it get it get it
All of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it
""Kay Are Ess One is con-tra-dic-to-ry""
Just cause I wouldn't let these rappers get with me
{Fuck} that, {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen
If a rapper wanna diss, yo I'd do it again
But I'm makin these ends, and I got my friends
And I really don't wanna have to sit in the pen
So I go back to the philosopher
1993 hip-hop is uhh.. wack
Go back, check the facts
1994, ""Return of the Boom Bap""
It wasn't all about the loot
It was all about Harry Allen Rhythm Cultural Institute
Blowin up, 1995
Conscious rap is still alive
But nobody wanna play it, nobody wanna say it
Nobody okayed it, they'd all rather hate it
1996 it really don't stop
We put together somethin called the Temple of Hip-Hop
Not just DJin, breakin, graf and lyrics
But how hip-hop affects the spirit
""Step Into a World,"" that's what I did
1997 I was raisin my kid
Or kids, but I, had to go
Cause New York DJ's changed the flows
To clothes and hoes, but that wasn't me
I'll be damned if I dance for the MTV
So in 1998 I began to debate
Should I go now, or should I really wait?
'99, I moved to L.A. you see
And took a gig with the WB
Started studyin philosophy full-time
To have a full heart, full body, full mind
But you know what the problem is or was?
DJ's don't raise our kids, cuz
They so caught up in the cash and jewels
How they gonna really see a hip-hop school?
How they gonna really see a hip-hop temple?
They don't even wanna play my instrumentals, but
Big up Dr. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit
Especially Xzibit, he was there in a minute
Mic Conception, all of them, said
""Yo you need help? I should call them""
When I was in L.A., I held the crown
Bloods, Crips, they held me down
I could never forget Mad Lion, killer pride
With the gat in the lap in the low-ride
Oh I can't forget, Icy Ice, Lucky Lou
Julio G, that was the crew
Davey D, Ingrid, David Connor
The list goes on and on, let me tell ya
FredWreck, and my man Protest
Much respect, no less
To my spiritual and mental defenders
Big up to L.A., temple members
But in 2000, I seen how I wanted to live
I wasn't no executive
So I picked up the mic and I quit my job
Said to Simone I gotta get with God
She said, ""Don't worry bout these dollars and quarters.
Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya.""
Damn, she took me back to Bam!
Took me back to who I am!
Brought me back to the New York land!
Now I overstand!

Now KRS-One, now you've been quoted as saying that
Rap is something we do, hip-hop is something you live.
{KRS} Yes!
{interviewer}
Explain that to us please.
{KRS-One}
Well, well, today hip-hop, we are advocating that hip-hop is not,
Just a music, it is an attitude, it is an awareness, it is a way
To view the world. So rap music, is something we do, but HIP-HOP,
Is something we live. And we look at hip-hop, in it's 9 elements;
Which is breaking, emceeing, graffiti art, deejaying, beatboxing,
Street fashion, street language, street knowledge, and street
Entrepenurialism - trade and business. And uhh, that's where y'know
That's the hip-hop that that that we're about. We come from the uhh
The root of, of Kool DJ Herc, who originated hip-hop in the early 70's
And then Afrika Bambaata and Zulu Nation (mmhmm)
Who instigated something called The Infinity Lessons
And added conciousness to hip-hop, and then Grandmaster Flash
With the invention of the mixer, on to Run-D.M.C. and then myself.
And uhh, we created the ""Stop the Violence"" movement, you may recall
A song, ""Self Destruction"" and and and so on. All of this, goes to
Uhh uhh, the idea of LIVING this culture out and taking responsibility
For how it looks and and acts in society.",Hiphop Knowledge

A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't MAKE YOU A THUG
That tough guy talk don't MAKE YOU A THUG
An ill mug and a gat don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A real thug is a thug that's HUSH!
A doo rag a platinum chain don't MAKE YOU A THUG

Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
We CRUSH, THEM, and they crew
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to do
While they floss with the chi-ching and all the rings
You stay focused, keep doin your thing
You cannot get the diamond ring, if you can't really sing
Or if you haven't got a skill, that you ready to fling
What you bringin to the table if you not really able
Tryin to get to the top, like the Tower of Babel
Back in the days, remember all the old gold cables
Where they at now? Sold, when they dropped from the label
All the money they gave you made you very unstable
They really enslaved but you wasn't able with the coke in your nasal
to see, you up in the crib but they rockin your cradle
You a joke and you fatal, they made you an M.C.
Meaning: Most Confused
Not E-M-see-E-E, that's what I use
Many people really want to know from me

I refuse to come up short, I refuse to lose
I refuse to be caught in the court
I refuse to refuse bein taught, I refuse evil thoughts

I hit it all day, all night, all afternoon
Rock all mics from the days of sassoon
Where the hell was you? On the corner with rats
when we was at the LQ, lockin it down and that was that
Divine speaker, mind keeper, time teacher, time leader
I'll be sittin in the club by the speaker
Waitin for you rappers to choke up then I eat ya

You find that in those with skills
This a real MC, of the highest degree
With no video, my show they dyin to see
Not whether I'm buyin 'em three

Don't you think it's time we thought about the future?
Whether our children they gonna be winners or losers?
Don't you think it's time to advance the rhyme we spit?
Whether you know it or not, you deep in politics
All inside of it, in fact YOU the issue
Don't let this government diss you!
They really do not want you to vote
They really do not want you to hope
They really want you sniffin they coke
You look around yo we missin the boat
I coulda wrote about ANYTHING to get on, but this what I wrote
And what I'm writin, is guaranteed to enlighten
Like Dr. Cornel West, Michael Eric Dyson
This is how we do it today, enough of the crime talk
KRS got somethin new to say
Rise up, and put aside childish things
This is the message we bring; listen
[Chorus Two]
[KRS-One]
Last verse, KRS, blast first
Ignorance is bad, but temptation that's worse
They hide they purse, cause of the way we spit the verse
No one ever told 'em that the style's rehearsed
And even if they did, it wouldn't be new to they mind
Cause all day rappers confess to doin these crimes
So when the cops see you, they're not thinkin about me
They thinkin about takin you out of society
Keep it right, don't lie to me
You think it's too much preachin teachin?
Huh, well fine, we'll see
When you're locked up in J.D.C., or even prison
The truth shall set you free, just listen
You want health, and really that's about prevention
You want love, real love, and not depression
You want awareness, which come from discipline and will
You want wealth, which come from skills
When you really ready to talk, let's build
You ain't gotta be a scholar to know the next 4 years gonna be ill
I believe you already know the drill, don't lie
don't steal, seek peace and don't kill

We the winners, cause they the sinners

Workin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin
Workin while the world is turnin and these cities burnin
God is always workin, workin while you learnin
Workin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy? I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap
Slangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me

[Chorus]

One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin while they pants is tight?
They not hot! Really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
if these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child
Keep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin
But this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
Listen, listen, listen

[Chorus]

Look! Spiritual minded, you must find it
Find your spirit and go deep inside it
This goes out to the Christ-ians listenin
This is the flow that, gospel's missin it's
urban inspirational rap
We got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack
We respect tradition, from the start
But we now know, the true word of God is written in our heart
We gotta say somethin to the streets kid!
All these churches surroundin the devil still ain't defeat it?
They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From ""Criminal"" to ""Spiritual Minded"", now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money, and a movie part
Let me begin - what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're livin in sin
Hear the truth - how long you think you gonna last
Rockin the mic, without havin to go back to class?
Now you're forced, to listen to the teacher outrap them
Yes there's life after platinum",Ain't Ready
KRS-One,"You think this is easy right? (Yeah!)
You think this is easy right? (That's easy!)
You think you got what it takes? (Yeah that's easy!)
Huh, we gon' see.. we gon' see right now (Now what?)
Look

So you wanna be a conscious rapper
Can you handle the press and they negative chatter
Can you eat cold platters, and still spit data
Watchin others spit lies and they pockets get fatter
Can you climb up the ladder, and reach the top?
But it still doesn't matter, cause you ain't pop
Can you rock for the love of the art
Can you drop hit after hit after hit and still don't chart?
Can you REALLY stay loyal to God
when your life is full of strife, plus it always seems so hard
Can you handle the criticism
People holdin you up to higher standards, but they don't live 'em?
Can you hear these kiddy flows and laugh at it
But when you spit they callin you arrogant?
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', let's do it!

[Chorus]
Think you can do what I do
Think you can step in my shoes
You have no clue what I go through
You never felt my pain
When they attack my name
All because I have spoken the truth

To be a conscious rapper ain't a mystery
You gotta laugh when they call you contradictory
The whole industry, you gotta push and pull it
To really get with me, you gotta dodge they bullets
Blaow, blaow, blaow, every day and every way
You critics got somethin to say
At the same time, you gotta uphold Christ
Uphold life, while others flash cars and ice
It could break you down, take you down, make you frown
It could actually shake your ground
But if you love who you are, and believe in that
Best believe you will BE where the teacher's at
And where's that? In fact, in cold or heat
Yes, I declare victory over the streets
Overstand, over these beats, over the so-called elite
Over the strong, over the weak
I know how to speak, and most of all I know how to eat
I know I want humble and meek
So you better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', uhh

[Chorus]

Look!
So you thinkin about bein a concious MC
Well you gotta love God and you got to live free
You got to see the life that others can't see
You got to be the person that others can't be
You can't be a S-L-A, V-E
If you sayin to yourself, ""This may be me""
Then you know goin in that you work against sin
Your very skills will kill the demons within
So don't expect respect from slaves and hoes
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Especially black mags, you know they don't know
Just go to the crowd that you know will need you
Cause NOTHING compares to the respect of the people
That's what you look for, that's what you work with
Cause anything else, is truly worthless
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris'
You better think about that, 'fore you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris', uhh

KRS-One,"God core, urban inspirational
Holy hip hop
You know the type, all in your city
Word up

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

Let's come together once and for all
Before our children cannot walk in the mall
Before we cannot talk or walk at all already aviation is stalled
Now everybody wants to drive, bringing our highways to a crawl

Just about three weeks on back
I was talking to a journalist about my album, the sneak attack
Now I know, why I felt that way
Why the cards God revealed to me was dealt that way

Be prepared for the unexpected, that was the theme
But if your booty's shaking, you can't know what that means
Look, we all, in the, same, game
It's that world bank game that got struck with two flame

But we, yes the people, are struck with true pain
'Coz the world Bank'll do the same under a new name
We gotta recognize the prize and the people at the door
No more lies, you can no longer ignore

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory

Captivating lyrical flow
(They don't play it on radio)

Yeah, but the spirit know
But only a few can hear it though
The metaphysical lyrical blow
The minute you're in it and hear it, yo

See the evil and clear it, yo
See that for as many that died there was twice as many miracles
Uh, so let the dead bury their dead
Life is but a dream and in the dream we gotta get ready for bed

Better we look ahead instead, to the ones that survived
Pray for them too, 'coz there grace of God kept them alive
Yes, we mourn for the dead and will still kill for them
But what about the injured that must still rebuild again?

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

To all the people, that never lost someone
Consider the cost of the loss of a lost daughter or son
These cowards slaughter and run
And to know that there's more than just one

Makes you wanna store up your gun
And withdraw all the funds, but

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victorya
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

Y'all don't really about why we stay trapped

First realize givin up is wack
Say to yourself I can never be wack
Then realize that we must go back
And the reason you can't seem to get on track
is you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
And how I get down and move around
I've already been to the proving ground
In conscious rap, who rule the sound
The question is are you down?

Look - KRS-One, I've learned already
Everything they doin is temporary
No matter how big you live
You still the creation of a music executive
And when you get old no matter what you did
They throw you away and they pimp your kid
Yeah kids, on the TV whylin
You know why we got racial profilin?
Cause you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name

And then we will see we were under attack
But it'll be too late, the loss'll be too great
You'll see, just wait!

Teachin our kids which way to go
And the way that they tell our kids to go
If you listen, heads right straight to prison

Where hip-hop is, Digital-ly Underground like Shock is

TV is wack, they wanna show us beatin Iraq
When the question is, is where is Chandra Levy at?

Murdered God and left for dead like hip-hop

Now the, blind is the leaders, your styles is egregious
Gets now the brow beateth to underground emceeth

No doubt, they sellin us out, what's happenin loc?
Quit this rappin I won't, cause MC'n is dope
If I can't do it for the love then do it I won't
How many times we note when these rappers is dope
Satisfied, that's why I'm renewin your hope
Broaden your scope, when cleaned out your mind

If a man really wants you, that man really flaunts you
In public or private a real man really supports you
'Member what Guru taught you? Of course you ""Royalty""
You dress how you like when a QUEEN is what you ought to be
and ought to act like, and also ought to manifest
How you dress makes you constantly blessed, or constantly stressed
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} Yo!

{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}

Yo, yo
So while you burnin off those calories, think about reality
Get a skill for the salary, a man for the family
Not a boy, that's a catastrophe, don't get mad at me
Instead of always clubbin visit museums and art galleries
Pick the single man, admirin the ancient sculpture
He's cultured, chances are he won't insult ya
Give him your number only after you know what he does
Ask him what it is, not what it was
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the, you want the, you want the
C'mon, you gotta {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}",Take Your Tyme
KRS-One,"At midday today, some Americans attended memorial services
For victims of Tuesday's acts of terrorism. Thousands
Gathered at Chicago's Daily Plaza. Hundreds more looked
On from the windows of surrounding office buildings.
Many waved flags, and traffic came to a complete standstill.
On the rooftop of City Hall, which faces Daily Plaza, a
Police sharpshooter watched the crowd, even as he saluted
The flag. After a minute of silence, church bells rang.""

{Ain't no need in all the tears, oh no no, yeah yeah
Yeah cause things will be better tomorrow}

[Chorus x2]
No need for tears, no need to cry
No matter what we face, we shall get by
When the problems you face are too much to bear
Know I'll be there

Hold that head up y'all, don't get fed up y'all
C'mon let's get up y'all
Make that bed up y'all, life is a set-up y'all
Sadness comes from a lack of knowin, not knowin
Where the one that you love is goin
We all gonna reap what we all are sewin
There is no death, just constant growin
We can't stay here forever
We all gotta go to a place we believe is better
So why be sad, why be mad
Now you can see it ain't about the cheddar
It's all about the time that we spend together
Not the rhyme or the crime or the Gucci sweater
The house that's built on a rock can stand the weather
Faith, can stand the weather
But is your house, upon the rock
Or is it on sand and about to drop
Here is the question that you got to ask
Do I live for today or do I live for the past?
Think fast, but do not hurry
Life is a class and we should not worry
But tell me, how long you gonna ignore
Tell me how long you gonna ignore God's law?
How long can you really endure
Livin like pimps, livin like whores
The choice is yours, or really ours
Think about this while you lay the flowers
On the grave, uh, let's talk about how you behave, uh
Do you come out the neighb' or out the cave?
Better change your ways, we comin up on some stranger days

[Chorus]

Uhh, uhh
Don't step where the danger lays or danger lies
Open them EYES UP, better to RISE UP, WISE UP
Raise your MINDS UP
Look to the left, look to the right
Pray in the day and the night
Be prepared for the fight, not scared of the fight
He's the way, the truth AND the light
J to the E to the S to the U to the S
You can remove the stress
Yes, we do need you here
Yes, we wanna be free from fear
Yes, we wanna start seein clear
Havin you here, not over there
Lookin around sayin where, does anybody care?
Yeah, I'll be there
At the door, not at the war
At Matthew 5:44
""But I say, unto you
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you
Do good to them that hate you
And pray for them which despitefully use you
And persecute you""
This goes for them terrorists too
But them publicans, done put themSELVES up above again
Lookin for blood again, hate no love again
Got them soldiers runnin in, with a gun again
With a ton of sin, in a holy war, how we gonna win?
I think it's time for KRS-One again

[Chorus: x2] 

The time is now, you gotta make your choice
Which side are you on? Turn now to Matthew 5:46
""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
Do not even the publicans the same?
And if ye salute your breddern only, what do ye more than others
Do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect;
Even as your FATHER which is in heaven, is perfect""",Tears
KRS-One,"C'mon, gather round now, gather round now, look now
How many times did you pre-meditate
what you thought was your fate, cause you couldn't just wait
You had to have it the way that you thought in your mind
But in the end, everything came in time
But before the time, you was losin your mind
You was racin and rushin and fallin behind
But let me tell you bout God and the way that She works
I mean the way that He works, I mean the way that We work
You gotta trust in your Lord, everything is in accord
Don't rush or fuss, you gonna get yours
Close your eyes, your heart, your ears, your mind
to the ways and thoughts of mankind
And seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And things won't seem so hard
You gotta trust your Lord, uhh, uhh.. tell 'em bout

[Chorus]
Trust and obey, trust when afraid
Trust when you paid, trust when betrayed
Trust when you fear, trust when you unclear
Trust when you here, trust when you near
Trust when you down, trust when you found
Trust when you clown, trust

C'mon, let's do it again, uh, uh
Let's raise it up, c'mon, look

After you live and you learn then you see
You will learn how to trust in your G-O-D
You will be so free, you won't see no me
You will only see the will of the almighty
You sick of what? Well ya will, give it up
Stop thinkin and begin to, live it up
Every time you think it's one way it's not
Every time you wanna start you really stop
Trust in the inner the outer is for the sinners
In fact this whole rap is for beginners
Those that have talked and walked upon the path
Know that they get what they want before they act
So why rush, if your respect is due
Whatever you DON'T have is protectin you
Here's what you DO have that be bringin the drama
Ask and it shall be given, with a comma

[Chorus]

You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends

Uh uh, soundin good, soundin good, look, look
So when will you be it, when will you see it
That thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it
But God be lookin out for you
Puttin a stop to what you're about to do
In your life, and in your circumstances
Every time you speak you be takin chances
Talkin bout things that you really don't have to have
So when you get 'em, your life turns sad
Your life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?
Trust in God, that's where the crown is at
It's not in what you get, it's what happens after that
So if you think your life is shrinkin
It may be cause you keep thinkin
Not that intellect is wrong
It's just the beginning, it might be time to move on

KRS-One,"You cats still worried about chart position
It's the heart that your missin
It's the art that your missin
Just a little something to hold why'all over

The Kristal album on the way, word up
When you're number one, everybody come
But when you drop to two everybody still with you
But when you drop to three everybody want to see

But when you drop to four everybody still endures
But when you drop to five people will help you strive
When you drop to six you still in every mix
But when you drop to seven people start guessin

When you drop to eight people hesitate
But when you drop to nine that's when you start to find
That when you drop to ten you start to lose your friends
When you drop to eleven your record stop sellin

When you drop to twelve it's everyone for themselves
So when you drop to thirteen you stop working
When you drop to fourteen no more self esteem
You drop to fifteen 'cause you lived and you seen

When you drop to sixteen you now out the scene
When you drop to seventeen you see things you never seen
Like when you drop to eighteen you know what it mean
So drop to nineteen and on then to twenty

At nineteen you lose your honey
At twenty your money to a Playboy bunny
At twenty one things ain't funny
At twenty two you don't know what to do

So you hit twenty three you look for security
So you drop to twenty four no more can you endure
When you drop to twenty five at the bottom you've arrived
When you drop to twenty six you in a old school mix

When you drop to twenty seven until you start steppin
When you drop to twenty eight you start to meditate
When you drop to twenty nine you expand your mind
When you drop to thirty you see it was all dirty

No you drop to thirty two and it occurs to you
When you hit thirty three now you can see
That it's all about skill and a love for the art
Not whose above or whose below in the chart

KRS-One,"Word up, it's just a little somethin' to tide you over
Word up, the KRS style album comin' soon, KRS-One
All in the room, we gonna bounce these cats this year
Word up, why they do this? Ha, yo, yo

I climb up the back of rappers, reach over they head
And rap backwards at 'em, excuse me, madam
I used to throw these Uzi's at 'em
But I'm a teacher, skills I truly have 'em
These clubs, I duly pack 'em

Potential lawyers, engineers and doctors, I do attract 'em
Go to your professors and ask 'em
If the songs of the edutainment in college
They didn't blast 'em

Yes, I'm that ancient one, I set the framework
For today's rappers to make they funds
But no, you don't know me son
My facial features matches the Sphinx with it's nose redone

You know how many clubs we done, rocked?
You know how many guns we done, popped?
You know how many funds we done, dropped?
You know how many ones we done, got?
We been gettin' live since the days of Chubb Rock

We know how to survive, these other cats
Be in at nine o'clock then be out at five, uhh
We doin' the overtime on stage, I over-rhyme
Makin' these whack rappers tow the line

Steppin' to me, I know you blind 'cause your whole flow
Your show, your style, you know it's all mine
The first time you learned to spit, it was either me
Kane, Rakim or Slick Rick

Welcome to the KRS style
This year I had to switch styles and bust off, two missiles
And that's not all, rappers have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall but still in all
I have X amount of lyrics to get 'em all

Live at the club, I spit 'em all
Rappers backstage lookin' sad and pitiful
'Cause they know I'm the pinnacle and they minimal
I spit the metaphysical, the spiritual
The oracle, the lyrical, the oratorical

Rookie, I'll mop the floor wit you
I'm the lyrical foundation to all your flows
All your clothes, all your shows and I'm not alone
You wouldn't even know how to hold the mic or the phone

You couldn't even bite on the bone
While we was rockin' mic's out in Rome
Now you hyped 'cause you grown
You know we internationally known

The people love it, but what they learnin' 'bout
Is on the whole, look above it, but let us get back
To what we call hip-hop
Before you, whack rappers went, pop

Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what?  Ah yeah!

So here I go kickin science in ninety-five
I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
Don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
Roamin through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Wack MC's have only one style: gun buck
But when you say, ""Let's buck for revolution""
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY!
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK!
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO!
That's for calling my sister a hoe, and for you
BUCK BUCK BUCK, cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
You black people still thinkin about vot-ing
Every president we ever had lied
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died!

[Chorus]

This is not the first time I came to the planet
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin to like
Get wit you, showin you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form,  I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
And enters into Kwame Ture

[Chorus]

In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
The devil cannot see through as I unload
Into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
And leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin up static
Makin you a naked body, attic and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic",Ah Yeah!

It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style  (sound of the mic)
I know the way how  (I know)
Bring it back to one
It's supposed to be

This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they runnin' this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and poppin' them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we poppin' they brains out
It's supposed to be about seekin' in the seek out
You witnessin' injustice, you got to speak out
If you claimin' you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about

[Chorus]

Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you runnin' over me
It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
A Hiphop guild�we got to begin buildin' 'em
It's supposed to be NO police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of OUR lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wilderness;you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about makin' it better
You see, Hiphop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go ahead be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that

[Chorus]

You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doin' your part, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Pursuin' your art, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you movin' slowly
Then talkin' junk when you don't even know me
And you cats be pussy like Josie
ITouch ""50 MC's"" like +Tony+

Yo, how bad do you want it?
Fear I ain't got no time for it
If you want it, yo there's the track;put your rhyme on it!

This hunger inside of me's unexplainable, Kris
The struggle we put in this box will be put into disc
Birth and ever, these family problems is hurtin'
Both of my sisters is pregnant, fuckin' feel like murkin'
All I have is my word and my balls
And my fam and my music speaks for them all
It's the Dominican animal ready to damage, you puttin'
Pressure to rappers that think they can challenge you, Kris (uh huh)
We been through it all, the grimiest days, this earth ain't
Ready for my brain, comin' to face (word)
Everyone plus everyone
Do you hear me, KRS-One?

Well listen
You grimy and hungry?
But how long you gonn' trust me?
You really down for this cause or just chasin' the money?
I be up in them spots to be hot, so dusty and ugly
Nothin' be funny, it's all dark, nothin' sunny
Can you walk with me? Talk with me? Pop the cork with me?
When we in other cities, will you rep New York with me? (yeah!)
I need respect and honor
Discipline and no drama
How bad you want it, poppa? (with all my)

After you rap, will you stab my back? (never)
You gimme a track, will you take that back? (never)
I give the word, yo you bustin' your Gatt? (whatever)
Respect from your crew? They livin' like that? (they better)
This is no game! Why should I make you popular?
You know I'm the philosopha
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
If you see it, you can believe it, perceive it, retrieve it and flaunt it
How bad do you want, doggone it, there's the track, if you want it
You got to put your rhyme on it!

How bad do I want it? I'm ready to die like Big
A serious man with blood in my eyes for this
Success doesn't come overnight
It's gonna be dark a while until I see light (that's right!)
What is it?

This is no game, why should I do it?
KRS-One, me and Peedo runnin' through it
I saw you down the street in FedEx
You said you had the beats was comin', like ""I Got Next""

This is KRS-One�turn my voice up! Wha� (wha-,wha-)
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you see it?
How bad do you hear it?
How bad do you BELIEVE you can be it?
If you doubt, then you're out
If you believe, you can achieve
I got the city on lock, but I'm gonna hand you the Keys like Alicia
You know my style, you know I'm the teacha

With the heater
You comin' with me? You runnin' with me?
In the spirit Scott LaRock, JMJ and Pun is with me
Yo, cats be steppin' to me ALL the time
With the rawest rhyme
But two weeks later, they fall to crime
If you listenin' to this song, and you want to be put on
You must be loyal to the cats that made you strong
It could be your friend, your father, you sister, your mother, your brother or some other
Just remember the days when YOU was under!
Before the Hummer, before the Benz
Before the hundreds, before the fifties, the twenties and tens
When you was thirsty, remember the living water, and who poured it

It's all a struggle (from my hood to around your way)
It's all a struggle (single parents all by theyself)
It's all a struggle (diseases decreasin your health)
It's all a struggle (fiends swearin that's they last puff)
It's all a struggle (hustler tryin to avoid handcuffs)
(No matter what you do, who you are or where you from)
(Rich poor black white, at the end of the day)

It's all a struggle, and most people's struggles are doubled
You ain't the only one with a challenge facin some trouble
Look at the woman chewed up by the dog with no muzzle
Or the workers that got trapped underground in that tunnel
Some kids are playin in pools, others in puddles
When they listen to the news the propaganda is subtle
But it's time for you to know that the cryin got to go
Release the guilt that you built and let it flow
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Move slow and on the low, this you gotta know
You don't get the muscles without the hard struggles
You ain't the only one out here tryin to get dough
From the hustler to the preacher to the government leaders
From the airline pilot to the chef to the teachers
We linked in the same huddle, in the same tussle'n'bustle
Cause at the end of the day, it's all a struggle

[Chorus]

It's all a struggle - but don't let the challenges bug you
Or the government drug you, or the thieves in the street
Beat and mug you - build your tunnel under the rubble
Come up on the other side eye to eye with the trouble
Look at the Twin Towers crumble
Look at the religious leadership stumble, everybody struggles
But not everybody comes through nifty, it's fifty/fifty
The city itself will outrun you quickly
Whether you be healthy or sickly
Whether you be wealthy or thrifty, ugly or pretty
Everybody's tryin to get 50's and 100's
I taught this at UCLA just off Sunset
Now run get ""Ruminations""
It's a book that I published for the healing of this nation
In just a few chapters we run through, some possible solutions
Cause at the end of the day

Let me tell you right not and the whole world
You are the only one

I saw them guys you were with
I don't flash platinum watches and drop-top whips
But you can rest assure you're my perfect fit
Every dollar that we get, we be earning it
Yo, you never have to worry about me taking a trip
Or leaving you at home so I can quickly forget
Yo, with me it's the opposite, you swerve the jeep
You the queen of your house, you earn your keep
And I respect that, in high school we both got left back
We both were divorced and had setbacks
But you should never let that depress you

You are the only one (one, one, one)

Crazy why love making we already did
Shit, that's why we got four kids
Romantic, our parenthood we planned it
On the queue two to England, cross the Atlantic
Respect, you don't have to demand
It's like you got the perfect husband and your friends cant stand it
Especially when I watch the kids
And when you come home I ain't trying to find out what you did
It flips theirs leave, 'cause they looking for the player
A little boy trying to pay theirs cell phones and pagers
But with me you living with the savior
We be up in the temple of hip-hop, or chilling with the mayor
I thank the creator
We don't need what they handing out
This is what your man is about
It's like peace and much love
Trust and respect
Your friends may have diamonds but they ain't get that yet
They may have the burghettes and cars and private jets
But all they're really good for is sex

[Chorus]

We be hanging out late night at Denny's
Having conversations about every and any
Many people want what we got
A relationship that just keeps getting hot like hip-hop
You know I'm not the regular guy
You know I can't be compared
You know when the drama comes I aint scared
My name rings bells in the street
You can say my name in any hood your protection is complete
Thugs be right on their feet
Saying 'What, your man is Kris?'
You don't worry miss

[Chorus]

But most of the time you're with me and the kids
Mind at ease, chilling out at Chucky Cheese's
These are my kids, I know what their need is
I know what the doctor bill in school to which in fee is
My daughter, I know who she is
And all my sons know exactly what being free is

[Chorus]

No, you might not get the drop-top three
But all your kids want to be like me
Their father, and even when times is getting harder
There's only one name you could trust, Kris Parker

What does it mean to be UNDERGROUND?
It means you gotta be free to be UNDERGROUND
Yo, you got your own key when you're UNDERGROUND

Now look around your own town for the UNDERGROUND
Yo, you rhymin for the TV, or a million CD's?
You ain't a MC, you ain't UNDERGROUND
You could be platinum or gold, hot or cold
But it's the respect you hold that's UNDERGROUND
When the critics don't get, that for the streets you spit it
When your lyric they fear, that's UNDERGROUND

Not hip-pop, you UNDERGROUND
Yo it ain't about jewels, bitches and cars
It's about Nas, that's UNDERGROUND, yo!

To be underground simply means that you're down
for the struggle, get 'em up, that's UNDERGROUND
You could be a classy lady or a whore
But if you protest the war, for sure, you UNDERGROUND

We carry books around, manuals are bound in leather
We rock the center, the only point that's in the circle
We free MC's, what we decree will not desert you
We know what we doin, we wise and we chillin
We calculate against the continued cries of our children
They may be cryin now but they won't be cryin later
We love hip-hop, because WE are it's creators
So we, build the Temple, write the books, teach the classes
Create instrumentals, write hooks and rock masses

And that's my track, and that's my rap
And that's some chorus they did way back, look honey bringin' it back

Animating every rhyme and every dare in every mind

Hey yo, once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets, you see stress
Streets a matter of life and death, no regrets
Life's a test, strife, wit special effects
Neighborhood's full of reps, cities are projects
Where the young cadets get stripes from the vets
And comrades quest to be the next, to fitness 
Collect debts and select bets with death threats
Object, chedder, better your total net
Where trends are set from ways to express the outfits
Friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect
Avenues to check, boulevards to sweat
The smell of gun smoke more common than cigarettes

We got clicks for wreck
We like Pits for pets
We got Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets
We like much respect and sex extra wet
And high-tech dialect you ain't catch yet

Ya out there?
No doubt
Brooklyn,
Ya out there?

Hey yo, we got blocks and glocks with
Big shots with big knots and big props
Yo this is where the bullshit stops
Where herbs get got, if you snitch you get shot
We get down and leave the town in a state of shock
We got dangerous hang out spots and slick cops
Place called Riker's Island where kids get locked
A lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops
Styles are top notch, this is the place to watch
So bust the box, the radio station is Hot
Ease your mind staring at skylines from rooftops
Flip scripts for chips, and new whips off the lot
Quick to call a shot, politic with thick plots
And the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got
To make sure the core of the Big Apple don't rot
Where seeing's believing, we be achieving a lot

With many places to meet, you get lost in city streets
The city that never sleeps
Mecca, Medina the population increase
The desert and the oasis, New York, the far East
With Gods and Sheiks, pretty Amazons for weeks
Player dons that fleece the family's black sheep
Icons that teach that we all act unique
We got stats to reach so we all have to eat
A mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece
The crafts elite, we going past the beat
The latest technique no other place get as deep
Who parks release some of the worlds greatest athletes
DJ's and MC's and graffiti artists
Who use walls and subway trains for marquees 
We go back to B-boys, break dancing, break beats
And it'll never cease, and on that note, we say peace",New York

Get on the mic and do the best you can

Well, the teacher comes to you, in effect 
From a different style, a whole different sect 
I inject, force and intellect 
When I hit the mic, suckers hit the deck 
I come correct and practice what I preach 
I don't pimp you or rule you I teach 
Come through the doors and slap up whores 
Ordering them to put back on their drawers 
Cause, I run their pimp 
When I leave he leaves with a limp 
Shrimp, I got the tartar sauce 
Never underestimate the power of the force 
of the intellectual KRS-One 
I don't think yet my job is done, because 
I stand alone while others have to verify 
Just why they are thought to be fly 
Makin the public believe that they are way up in the sky 
Sort of like a rap superguy 
But I, horrify and terrify the super duper rap guy 
Because you're SOFT as a lullaby 
While they sit on their throne lookin 
Well I'm walkin in the streets of Brooklyn 
Or Harlem and Queens and Bronx and 
I'm even out there walkin in Compton 
Cause everywhere BDP is schoolin 
So anywhere, KRS is coolin 
I'm not foolin, cause no, I'm not a fool 
Don't act stupid boy, you know the rules 

Word, aiyyo Kris, they act like they don't know the rules 
But yo, I tell you what 
Yo get on the mic and tell em what makes up KRS-One 
YaknowhatI'msayin? Huh, and ya don't stop 
Verse Two: KRS 
Yo, from off the sidewalk I grab the mic and talk 
Born nineteen-sixty-five in the state of New York 
My name is Kris Parker, KRS-One for short 
I slap up crews and rock parties for sport 
Lived on the streets about eight years straight 
There I got my education and learned to debate 
So when I pick up the microphone I know what I'm sayin 
Education doesn't come from simply obeyin 
the curriculum, of the school criteria 
In fact what I learned I found inferior 
I'm not a Muslim but I do support them 
My Father in heaven taught me and taught them 
I'm not a Christian, but I won't diss em 
I'm not a Jew, I don't practice Judaism 
I'm not a Buddhist, but Buddha's a master 
I don't eat beef pork nor Diet Shasta 
Reason for this is very simple indeed 
When it comes to music everybody's in need 
You got wealthy artists spendin money loosely 
You ask about the culture, they talk 'bout Gucci 
Metaphysics, the science of life 
And how to live, free from strife 
Walk with ease, and no disease 
Understand that I am the breeze 
And the trees, oceans and seas 
And the be and the D and the P's 
Suckers try it, but I don't buy it 
When I speak you seek to stay quiet 
Shut up! What what? You better stay cool 
And heed the warning boy, you know the rules! 

Ah one two yeah, and ya don't stop 
Ah three four (say what?) and ya don't stop 
Ah five six (pop pop) and ya don't stop 
Ah seven eight (get down) and ya don't stop

Your raps don't bubble 'cause they're inconceivable

In hip-hop's culture there's really no need for you

I'll bring the heat to you, when it comes to them glocks
Like Freddie Foxxx, I'm keepin two
I'm known for my scary feuds
That's why I'm called The Terrorist by the Daily News

I rarely lose, I'm known to rattle a cage
I'm known to throw rappers off the stage
Maybe it's a matter of age
But as a MC I got no patience for some rappers these days

I'm not old skool, or new skool, I'm all skool

I'm not old skool, or new skool, I'm all skool

I'm not old skool or new skool, I'm all skool

I fly through the hood like chicken wings do
Like a chef Marley likes mixin' things too

We came together just to change the weather
Busy Bee, he made this game remember?
These unoriginal rap flows, I don't speak those
Too many rappers just copy like Kinko's

Dressin' like they from office depot
Tryin' to be CEO's with whack weak flows
I teach those that flow how to be better
I train MC's to gain in any endeavor

But if you tryin' to diss, you'll get dismissed from the class
In other words, I'm kickin' yo' ass

You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
The investigation won't go further, kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper

Scott LaRock's a open case, unresolved
The cops never find the killer, when it's one of ours
Tupac's a open case, even though
He was killed in a open place, there's really no haste

It's sorta like we govern ourselves
Even though we lack a love for ourselves
Or is that we know this thug shit sells?
You want them pockets to swell well

Even though we know we livin' in hell, what about big L?
Hold up, let's stop frontin', let me tell you somethin'
JMJ's dead and the cops don't know nuthin'?
We gotta open our eyes to this too, this issue

It seems like when a rapper dies, it don't matter
He simply becomes a poster, somethin' to run after
A reason for these kids to pull they guns faster
Tryin' to emulate and be like dead rappers

I roll with them visionary look-ahead rappers
From the city to the farm pushin' John Deere tractors
Bust this, in the city, there is no justice
The whole system is flawed, how could you trust this?

Crimes can't seem to be solved when it's one of us
That's why there's no forgiveness and cats just wanna bust

Do the math loc or get goin

How can I get in the front if I ain't gettin in front

Lies spread it to none, rely on heaven and funds

Can't win on the streets dog you need a lawyer
Use your real eyes and realize

But when you're finished rhymin' you have not heard nothing new

So this one dedicated to the one that run their rhyme-a
Time after time after time after time
I know what you will say before you jump up on the stage
But make sure you don't say, ""Di-di-di-dah-di-di-di-day""

Then we'll have to look for you and chop you all up
So when you see me in the street just keep your mouth shut
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new, what?

Everythin' you doin' kid we already did it
Everythin' you spittin' kid we already spit it
This my 15th album, I'm havin' fun wit'chu critics
Everythin' you doin kid we already did it

If rap was a toilet, I woulda already shit it
Critics sayin', ""Kris you shoulda already quit it""
But I can't stop, won't stop spittin' crazy lyrics
'Cause I, am hip hop, other rappers just try

You critics wanna sit down and debate every line
But tryin' to get into my concert same time
Spot all packed up, cops yellin', ""Back up, back up""
KRS yellin', ""Sound man turn the track up""

We act up the whole spot a hour straight
We rock 30 classics at least 20 breaks
We always in demand and you must over stand man
We won't be found man on Billboard or SoundScan

Seek me and you will find
Where I be kickin' or spittin' that ill rhyme
Until then they can't see me 'cause I be
In the heart of every rapper I shine

Which one of you punk ass rappers
Wanna get chewed up like seafood platters?
Bring your best rhyme, it don't matter to me
You ain't gettin' on tonight by battlin' me

The streets won't forgive you man, them guns go blam
Have you crawlin' up the wall like Spider-Man
You all in the jungle, with no Spears like Brittney
Like the coke want Whitney, you still wanna get me

But no, you ain't made for this
I put my hand through your chest like Agent Smith
I jam like them big four-fifths
I go off like a glock 9, no safety on Kris

y'all talk 'bout platinum, I don't need all that
I got 26 gold and platinum plaques
I'll take away your rights like the Patriot Act
Have your whole crew thinkin', ""Well maybe he is kinda whack""

KRS-One & Marley Marl,"[Incomprehensible] to you super listeners how you doing tonight?
All you fly guys and fly girls
Welcome once again to the world famous
Mister Magic Rap Attack and of course I am [Incomprehensible]

Way way back before the 'Hots' and the 'Powers'
We used to listen to live mixin' for hours
Roxanne Shanté, U.T.F.O.
Mister Magic Rap Attack some of y'all know

But I was in the shelter in weakness
Homeless, turntableless and microphoneless
Fresh gearless but still I was fearless
And focused on being the dopest MC alive

It's '85, LL's on Def Jam with the best jam
And Whodini's on Jive, man you know I had to survive
New York City was crazy in the 80's but damn it was live

So here comes the Juice Crew with MC Shan
Shanté's already the queen, Marley's already the man
Y'all don't really understand
When you throw on Shanté or Shan it got live in the jam

So we went to Mister Magic
If anybody had to power to put you on he had it
We gave up the demo tape no love lost
But it seems Mister Magic just brushed us off

Somehow we heard we were whack
Every track, and that we shouldn't even call back
Right there my jaw dropped, no doubt
But it made me see what I was all about

And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got

We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got

In the spot new hip hop and Latin Quarters
And the Union Square and the rooftop
We used to hear them tunes pop in the parking lot
Where it got dark a lot me and Scott La Rock

But it was all for the hip hoppers
Salt-N-Pepa answered Doug E Fresh with 'The Show Stoppa'
MC Shan was gonna challenge LL
Shanté was battling 3 or 4 groups at the same time what the hell

Answer records were big then after Shanté did it
Everybody was trying to spit them so we spit off
To tell you the truth it was the only way an MC could get on

We answered MC Shan's 'Queensbridge'
A dope jam about where he was from and where he lived
But in the Bronx there was these kids
KRS, Scott La Rock trying to live

And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got

We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got

This it what an MC was we had a strong street buzz
Marley and Shan showed us some love and love never hurt
'Cause while Shan was with Marley we was with DJ Red Alert

Every Friday night, every Saturday night
On the airwaves the battle was right
Under New York nights, smog and lights
Jargon at night the Roxy used to get so hype

You could put on your headset
And get what heads didn't get yet
Live MCs going, ""Check, check""
Spitin' rhymes over the radio set

These are the days and the ways I can never forget
So I don't forget it to Marley and Shan I am indebted
For the start of my career these guys could take credit

For my rappin', the whole battle they let it all happen
Marley and Shan and Shanté could have been gun strapping cousin
But they wasn't and you know why
'Cause we was on some real hip hop let's keep it buzzing

We ain't done, uh huh
We ain't done, let's go
Here we go, here we go
Y'all been waitin? for this
Here we go

I spit them conscious lyrics for those that can hear it
I'd rather rhyme about the mind and the body and spirit
But them cats be too hardheaded, they like, ?Aww, forget it?
'Til they locked up and they blood is sheddin?

I really spit conscious rap
And when I say stop the violence
How you think we stoppin? that?
With a flower, a protest, a rally, a band
Oh no, I got the baseball bat in my hand

Overstand, I'm takin? a stand, not takin? ?The? stand
I don't disrespect women ?cause I'm a man
And some say fe-man
You uninformed journalists, y'all can talk to the hand

On my block, women get respect and trust
?Cause when you diss a woman you dissin? her fetus
And dissin? our unborn children will defeat us
I'm not an elitist, I just know the world need us

And the whole world don't need y'all
Y'all just beatmakers

A man once said that the streets are watchin' us
If this be the truth we must keep hip-hop in us
They'll never topple us, you done heard them thugs
Now, it's time to hear from the philosophers

Buildings fallin', employment stallin' us
Now, it's time, the future is callin' us
Television is boring us, radio is whorin' us
Lurin' us with a chorus plus, you can't even trust

The church, the synagogue, they all deceivin' us
It's time to believe in us
To believe in a hip-hop lifestyle that agrees with us
No squeeze or bust, bo, bo, you find ease with us

The DJ's, the MC's is us

My cats in Atlanta like ""I am hip-hop""
Cats in Miami like ""I am hip-hop""
Chi-Town like ""I am hip-hop""
All over L.A., ""I am hip-hop""

Keep the rawness, the gutter the real
The movement's growin' like corn in the field
KRS-One was born with the steel
I'm on top of my game like Shaquille O'Neal

No surprises, hip-hop come in all sizes

Kehidupan anak muda di kotaraya
Hari-hari ku mencari destinasi ini
Seperti semua aku juga punya mimpi
Namun kita berbeza
Usia, harta, rupa, latar keluarga
Hitam putih kehidupan sendiri menentukan
Namun terlalu banyak kehitaman dalam kehidupanku
Aku...aku lakukan apa perlu
Hari ganti hari masa terus berlalu
Bukan ku pinta kehidupan tak bererti
Situasi yang menjerat tak bisa ku lari lagi
Sampai bila, sampai bila nasib ku begini
Bila ku mati, siapa peduli?
Inilah sehari dalam diari
Anak metropolitan, di kotaraya ini

Adakah hidupku satu gurauan
Sekadar penuhkan pementasan
Diriku tak perlu belas kasihan
Bersendiri ku menyepi di sini
Jangan kau cuba mendekati
Kamu juga pentingkan diri sendiri
Mengakulah ini realiti
Yang lemah 'kan mati, gagah berlari
Sedar tidak sedar, akulah sisa
Dipandang hina tak pernah ku sangka
Kais pagi, aku berdosa lagi
Fikirku tak mungkin akan berlaku pada ku
Temanku...semuanya dikejar, diburu
Lambat laun tersungkur juga satu persatu
Bila-bila saja masanya 'kan tiba
Aku juga mnejadi lelaki diburu
Mengimbas sekias semalam
Anak kecil masa depan cerah menjadi malap
Takdirnya di dalam diari
Anak metropolitan ku bersendiri lagi
Sehari di dalam diari
Sebuah kehidupan di metropolitan

Sepuluh tahun pengalaman
Anak jalanan juga punya prinsip dan pegangan
Inilah dia syarat pertama
Jika gua tak kacau lu, lu jangan kacau gua
Apa jua kau berkata
Beranilah juga tanggung risikonya
Aku masih muda, umur dua tiga
Jangan kerana mulut badan binasa
Dan janganlah kau cuba menyekat dan berinasihat
Kerna mungkin kini masanya sudah terlewat
Biarku dengan caraku nanti hidup kau juga akan tidak menentu
Walaupun apa kau fikirkan
Aku masih menaruh sedikit harapan
Agar diari lebih bererti
Anak metropolitan tak perlu berdosa lagi

Who’s better, Mawi or Jackie
And in awards shows, will anyone ever beat Miss Siti?
Who cares if she’s got something going on

So why can’t we be obedient when no one’s watching us 24/7

Cause at the mamak stalls they watch the EPL scores
Maybe that’s why it’s hard for our national team to beat Singapore

Just think about it..just give it a chance coz we need it
There’s no one else in the world who cares if we don’t care at all
Just go on and on..and move on
Now everybody c’mon, Say ‘La-la-la..’

Haiya, why you want to fight-fight
Make noise some more
Make the blood go up
C’mon lah, we Malaysian what?!!
C’mon lah, together-gether mah

How to go far when we fight-fight
Make noise some more
Make the blood go up
C’mon lah, we Malaysian what?!!
C’mon lah, together-gether mah

Hey brutha..hey sista!

Too many wannabes in our Hip Hop community
Talking crap bout the ghetto, G thang and the rivalry
Talk the way you normally talk lah
You’re from KL, not an American rap star
What’s wrong with the honies wearing minis
Whether in the clubs or malls or streets in the cities
We make a big deal about the little things in life
On the differences rather than the similarities alike
Just chill, be cool with each other
After all there’s no one out there gonna do us this favour
Stop the slacking, dissin’, slammin’ and moanin’
'Cause we’re brothers and sisters, now everybody sing

Krumb Snatcha Mobsters,"Uh, '97
Premo, D&D why'all, that's right, I want to speak a little truth
'Bout what guns is really about cause me being victim of guns
Was an experience of gettin' Closer To God

Since the day I was young I had preminitions of an ending to come
Behind the barrel of the next man's gun
It used to be fun, when I'm the one doin' the clappin'
Now I'm facin' my death, doin' fast breath, no laughin'
How can this happen, holdin' my chest to the floor
Laid up, or spraid up dreamin' to even the score
Bright lights all I saw my life flashed before me
From a distance I heard a faint voice steady call me
I guess my time is here, suppress my fear I'm ready
Tryin' to breath steady, feelin' my legs gettin' heavy
Lord, don't let me..die this young, without leavin' a son
To carry tradition, listen my life has just begun
A nightmare flip visions of swingin' the poolstick
Defendin' my near if I turn left the pool quick
Lost control of my mind, flipped the safety of the nine
And squeezed tastin' down this judge and roused, then fell on my knees
Weak from my heart feel my chest gettin' hot, I got caught
Vivid memories of how my gun dropped, bullets in stock
Lost all thoughts of me rappin' try to catch one for I die
For self satisfaction, get up off my knees begged him don't please
Picked up the squeeze dipped behind cars bullet shelves hittin' the trees
Curse my enemies will be as smart enough to take cover
Feelin' my body shudder as I drop right in front of
The boot place as hot shells hit the cheek of my face
Catchin' bloody taste, watch my blood leave trace
Hennessy got me trippin' plus the brew I was sippin'
Feelin' more blood drippin' I see them load a second clip in
Betreated, I been defeated my life is ice like popsicles
Open the door hit the floor of the hospital
It's on

""Gettin' closer to god in a tight situation""
""Let me be your angel and I be your protection""
""I stopped breathin' damn I see demons""

My heart's racin' a casualty and convertation
Hopin' one day I'll awake and feelin' my body, start shakin'
I been mistakin' retaliation to come
Soon holdin' my gun boom on the floor of the hospital room
Or shall I cry for help as I look up at the ceiling
My inner feelin' tellin' me to start healin' not in a million
Years I would want to end here, whipin' my tears
Thinkin' of my long lost career, in this business of rap
Now flat on my back, tryin' to put it place to face on this enemy cat
Cardiac control, I put a hold on my soul
Twenty-two years old and my life gon' took her some toe
My body fall for numerous feelings I fell layin' here lonely
Watchin' my homie scream for help I hear a doctor
Yellin' directions to the meds cut open my friends
Bring me to the nearest bed half dead
My inner head screamin' losin' my breathin'
""Damn I see demons"" -> Snoop
Don't remember the good Krumb, only the bad one
And now I can tell the depths of hell for evils I've done
Can't run, facin' my worst of fears
Leavin' my physical as my spiritual descends stairs
But wait, this can't be real, I feel the agents are real
Askin' my name, overlookin' my bloodstained gold chain
Easin' my pain from where we came I don't know
But he's tellin' me it's not the right time to go
Back in my fo' tubes suckin' the ooze from my mouth
As nurses run about, tryin' to send me down south
Who shot ya? That's word from the detect' and the doctor
Before I got flown to Beantown in a helicopter

""Gettin' closer to god in a tight situation"" 
""Let me be your angel and I be your protection"" 
""I stopped breathin' damn I see demons""
""Gettin' closer to god in a tight situation"" 

I awake with cold feet feelin' weak and can't eat
Seein' homies stand around, but no sounds I can't speak
Cheap hospital clothes a badged up of holes got me depressed
As I'm lookin' at my legs and my chest
They patched up five, lucky that I had survived
Layin' in bed with a naked head, but alive
We call it a night, before, we tryin' to make sure
I was staggerin' in to the hospital door
Whosader, the flash to a honourable respitator
The flashback to me gettin' respect form my savior
I can't understand it, must been the way that they planned it
And my commandment I've never takin' live for granted
Rememberin' on my knees, beggin' please
Don't let my soul get seized, lost track of my thoughts
Cause the d.t.'s came and question me, testin' me
Guess havin' thoughts arrestin' me
Stop stressin' me cause ain't no confession see
Funny ain't it thought I was back in an inseignment
Now my image is tainted coughed on my crutches for enreignment

Whereas, breakbeats have been the missing link connecting the diasporic
community to its drum woven past
 Whereas  the quantised drum has allowed the whirling mathematicians to
calculate the ever changing distance between rock and stardom.
Whereas the velocity of the spinning vinyl, cross-faded, spun backwards, and
re-released at the same given moment of recorded history , yet at a
different moment in time's continuum has allowed history to catch up with
the present.

We do hereby declare reality unkempt by the changing standards of dialogue.
Statements, such as, ""keep it real"", especially when punctuating or
anticipating modes of ultra-violence inflicted psychologically or physically
or depicting an unchanging rule of events will hence forth be seen as
retro-active and not representative of the individually determined is.

Furthermore, as determined by the collective consciousness of this state of
being and the lessened distance between thought patterns and their secular
manifestations, the role of men as listening receptacles is to be increased
by a number no less than 70 percent of the current enlisted as vocal
aggressors.

Motherfuckers better realize, now is the time to self-actualize
We have found evidence that hip hops standard 85 rpm when increased by a
number as least half the rate of it's standard or decreased at ¾ of it's
speed may be a determining factor in heightening consciousness.

Studies show that when a given norm is changed in the face of the
unchanging, the remaining contradictions will parallel the truth.

Equate rhyme with reason, Sun with season

Our cyclical relationship to phenomenon has encouraged scholars to erase the
centers of periods, thus symbolizing the non-linear character of cause and
effect
Reject mediocrity!

Your current frequencies of understanding outweigh that which as been given
for you to understand.
The current standard is the equivalent of an adolescent restricted to the
diet of an infant.
The rapidly changing body would acquire dysfunctional and deformative
symptoms and could not properly mature on a diet of apple sauce and crushed
pears
Light years are interchangeable with years of living in darkness.
The role of darkness is not to be seen as, or equated with, Ignorance, but
with the unknown, and the mysteries of the unseen.

We are determining the future at this very moment.
We now know that the heart is the philosophers' stone
Our music is our alchemy
We stand as the manifested equivalent of 3 buckets of water and a hand full
of minerals, thus realizing that those very buckets turned upside down
supply the percussion factor of forever.
If you must count to keep the beat then count.
Find you mantra and awaken your subconscious.
Curve you circles counterclockwise
Use your cipher to decipher, Coded Language, man made laws.
Climb waterfalls and trees, commune with nature, snakes and bees.
Let your children name themselves and claim themselves as the new day for
today we are determined to be the channelers of these changing frequencies
into songs, paintings, writings, dance, drama, photography, carpentry,
crafts, love, and love.
We enlist every instrument: Acoustic, electronic.
Every so-called race, gender, and sexual preference.
Every per-son as beings of sound to acknowledge their responsibility to
uplift the consciousness of the entire fucking World.

Krysna,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Krysta Youngs,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

But you better sacrifice, before I have to close

The first one to take him to church
You helped turn him around

You better get it right, and forget your selfish ways

And know you inside

You set me, you lit me, I'm on fire
What a beautiful sight to see, I'm on fire
Until my light is burning bright

And let this flame get higher, fire

Let your fire feed on all my disbelief

By a life that I made
Destined to crash
Beat up and bruised

Lovely traces fall behind you

Lovely traces to remind you
Everything that you've been through
What it took to get you to me

All my mistakes
Regrettable choices I'd like to forget
But somehow you make
All that I wasted useful again
I thought I fell from grace
But you can't erase

The lovely traces behind you
Turn around and you will see
Lovely traces to remind you
Everything that you've been through
What it took to get you to me

Through everything around me I find comfort in You
Through trials and the heartache Your words, they speak the truth
Lay me down to sleep now, You'll still be on my mind
If I die before I wake, You'd still see through the lines

Pray for me one more time
I can feel You though You're not here

Yeah, I've been ripped out, cut short
Stopped within my tracks
I've been tied down, turned 'round
Learned to face the facts

I was nothing now something

Have they gone too far

But she knows she wants to feel beautiful

She struggles finding self-respect
She'll wake up feeling regret
Her purity's been compromised
But she knows she wants to feel beautiful

A promise made to treasure
You don't have to give it away
Falling for the pressure
You can't mend a vow when it breaks
Explain your hesitation
Jesus can be your escape
Don't taint the situation

Gotta make a move
Move it onto the bed
Temptation whispers in his head
Believe the lie
Suck it up and be a man

He'll trade her heart
For a trophy
Put it on the shelf
So his friends can see
He has what it takes to get what he wants
Tonight's the night
Suck it up and be a man

You might walk away unsatisfied

Is the only love to fill the void

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

A little flash of brilliant white
Reflecting the perfection of the world

Give her sisters, give her brothers
But compared to me and others
She'll always be a motherless girl

Every single day
There's a million parts to play
There isn't any time for being lonely
Going up in aeroplanes
Pulling back on pony reins
Making sure that what she wears
Is looking super like her hair
The emptiness inside
Isn't strong enough to hide
That her features aren't too pretty for her pearls

Give her sisters, give her brothers
But compared to me and others
She'll always be a motherless girl

Although it's heaven to touch her
She's just like a soldier
She loves
And as she sees you grow older
And no longer hold her
She knows

Give her sisters, give her brothers
But compared to me and others
She'll always be a motherless girl
Oh a history of lovers
But compared to me and others
She'll always be a motherless girl

Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree

I felt a little fear upon my back
He said, Don't look back, just keep on walking
When the big black horse said, Hey lady
(When the big black horse said, Look this way
Said, Look this way, will you marry me?
(Said, Hey, lady, will you marry me?)

But I said no, no, no, no, no, no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me

And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years

So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
Now it won't come back 'cause it's oh-so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see

And it said no, no, no, no, no, no
Said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Said no, no, you're not the one for me


Said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

And remaining in permanent crisis
Affection is yours if you ask
But first you must take off your mask
When you're backs turned I've decided
I'll throw it away just like I did

Find yourself up against another brick wall

Waiting to change

Is full of tired excuses
But it's to hard to say

Holding on with fingers and feelings alike

Clinging to a feeling like a fish on a line
It's sublime to find it lately
Hopeless
No more saying that there's no more time
That there's no more time

Well,
I'm just discovering
I'm living in a different body
Got a little insight into
Everything that's happening to me
Like a little spider, I'm climbing the insurmountable
But I never hold myself accountable

No oooh
Because I'm hopeless
Everybody says I'm hopeless
But I got a bit of hopeless
In this
Oh and you could never bring me down
Even though I got solid ground
Oh because I love it so
And I think you should know

That I'm hopeless
Everybody says it's just another decay
Of the soul But I know
I'm hopeless

Of being something you are not
In light of the incident
With that little piece of
Clothing you forgot
And now your cheveux
Has gone grey
And you're standing by the fire

And trickles a little, when I'm by myself
I wove a great story, to tell all who'd hear
Of murder and theft, and a message so clear
If for all of the glory, your heart is the cost
That jar of salt water, will be shattered and lost
But a foul wind was blowing, so mean and so still
Stirring the fate, to make real of my tale
And I like a boat, on a langourous sea
Was blind to the dangers, that hankered for me
The killer, he hooked me, and reeled me in
I looked in his eyes and saw nothing within
As soon as I saw him, I knew I would die
Two moonless black oceans, in sockets bone dry
My bones for the doorframe, my skull for the wall
A loft on a placard, on a prominent wall
My skin for a blanket, to scare winds so wild
My heart on the table, my teeth for the child
But what if the water, salt secrets I held
Unkindly discovered, as here I tell
I see through the walls, so I'll sing it myself

KT Tunstall,"Head to head with a demon in my dreams
Fight to the death and I don't know who wins
I'm sitting ringside and in the middle
How can I be both

Like love can be tough and I don't feel my age
But life is a moving ocean of colour
And I choose what I know
To be true

Often it's not the same as it first seemed
While nothing can last forever
Everything has its shape
And usually it's exactly what you need

What will it take to break the magic spell?
Who saw the mercy, who heard the whistle
Of a bullet as they fell?

Kuana Torres Kahele,"A long long time ago
There was a volcano
Living all alone in the middle of the sea

He sat high above his bay
Watching all the couples play
And wishing that he had someone too

And from his lava came
This song of hope that he sang out loud
Every day
For years and years

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Years of singing all alone
Turned his lava into stone
Until he was on the brink of extinction
But little did he know
That living in the sea below
Another volcano
Was listening to his song

Everyday she heard his tune
Her lava grew and grew
Because she believed his song was meant for her
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
As he sang his song of hope for the last time

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Rising from the sea below
Stood a lovely volcano
Looking all around
But she could not see him
He tried to sing to let her know
That she was not there alone
But with no lava, his song was all gone
He filled the sea with his tears
Watched his dreams disappear
As she remembered what his song meant to her

I have a dream
I hope will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Oh they were so happy
To finally meet above the sea
All together now their lava grew and grew
No longer are they all alone
With Aloha as their new home
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing

I have a dream I hope it will come true
That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you
We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too
I lava you
I lava you
I lava you",Lava

Daría todo por saber

Why tu cara ya no esté
Why me quede frente el mar

Ojalá que al despertar
Trates de pensar en mi
Porque yo no te olvidé why es que

Tú, eres todo para mi, todo lo que tengo yo
Why sin ti no seguiré viviendo
Tú, si es que puedes entender, yo jamás te dejaré
Aunque traten de alejarte de mi

Si estoy loco, qué me importa
De alguna forma voy a hacer
Que me devulvan de una vez
Una tarde junto a ti

Una risa, una foto
Una película después
Why una mañana te diré
Como duele el corazón

De sólo pensar que estás
Escondida en un rincón
Preguntándote por qué
Por qué, por qué

Tú, eres todo para mi, todo lo que tengo yo
Why sin ti no seguiré viviendo
Tú, si es que puedes entender, yo jamás te dejaré
Aunque traten de alejarte de mi

Tú, eres todo para mi, todo lo que tengo yo

Are they gonna fabricate the part to fix the hole in my lonely heart?
If I laugh its cause my tears ran dry, my sense of humor is my alibi
If you could hear what's going on inside, you'd hear my heart beat double time
She goes boom boom ,boom boom, boom boom ,boom boom, boom boom,
When I look at you

So I guess I'm gonna hit the streets, find someone who can rescue me
Locked up behind my rib cage, my heart wants to come out and play

My heart pumps red blood, big buckets of red love
That's exactly what she does, when its you I'm thinking of
If I were a machine my pistons would be pumping
You could hear my heart valves thumping like boom, boom, boom
If I were a machine my pulse pace would be jumping
You could hear my system bumping like boom, boom, boom",Boom Boom

Sometimes it takes him weeks

Am I bit too old for games?
Too young to have a spouse
I like to try new things

I know what love's about
Don't need no diamond ring

And we share all our time, all, all our time, all, all our time

Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

Kuh Ledesma,"When I think of home I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowing
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into meaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I could convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

Suddenly my world has changed it's face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing
Oh, if you're listening God
Please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe in the things that we see

Tell us, should we run away
Should we try and stay or would it be
Better just to let things be
Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So it's real, real to me

A world full of love

Trying to see poetry
Within the shifting imagery of meaning
Well, if you’re feeling hollow man, just throw the stone
To shatter your reflection with questions

Well, if you’re trying as hard as you can
To see where you fit in this plan
It’s a long road, long lonely road

But nobody really knows you as you are
And we'd like to see you shine
Yeah, we'd like to see you shine

I can see by the light that you shine on me
If I could surrender tomorrow
That the flames of fire inviting me
Are sending me further and further away

Scheiß drauf ich bleib Ghetto, sch-sch-scheiß' drauf ich bleib Ghetto
In Handschellen, wegen dem Aussehen und den Tattoos
Scheiß drauf ich bleib Ghetto, sch-sch-scheiß' drauf ich bleib Ghetto
Ich soll mich ändern, sonst gibt es keine Rettung?
Scheiß drauf ich bleib Ghetto, sch-sch-scheiß' drauf ich bleib Ghetto
Du kommst nicht klar? Pech, wir sind echt so
Scheiß drauf ich bleib Ghetto! sch-sch-scheiß' drauf ich bleib Ghetto",Ghetto
Kurdo,"Ja genau ich hab jetzt Sachen die sind wertvoll
Doch ich hab nicht vergessen wo ich herkomm
Ich weiß irgendwann werd ich wieder da sein
Denn irgendwann steht hier mein Grabstein
Ich hab's gesagt, ja ich bleib dabei man
Denn die Hälfte von mei'm Herz bleibt in der Heimat
Kann dich nicht vergessen, von dir hab ich die Narben
Ich träume von dir, dass ich wieder da bin
Fühl mich fremd hier, ich seh das in ihr'n Augen
Ich fühl mich wie ein kleines Kind, als hätt ich mich verlaufen
Meine Heimat im Fernsehen, Bombenkrieg
Mama weint, sie hat damals dort gespielt
Flüchten vor dem Krieg, verlass was du hast
Manche meiner Freunde haben's leider nicht geschafft
Ich wünsche mir ich könnte an der Zeit dreh'n
Es ist lange her, ich hab Heimweh

Abschiedstränen, küssen und umarmen
Und dann ging es los, flüchten mit dem Wagen
Die letzten Blicke, winken aus dem Fenster
Der Moment wenn du weißt du kannst nix mehr ändern
Ich sah Mama, wie sie ihre Augen schließt
Denn sie wollte nicht dass ihr Kind sie traurig sieht
Wie kannst du nicht traurig sein, wenn du nicht mehr viel hast?
Wo soll ich jetzt spielen, meine Heimat war mein Spielplatz
Papa sagte ich bringe euch in Sicherheit
Vom Krieg in das Ghetto, ich gehör zu ner Minderheit
Du merkst schnell dass du das Klima nicht verträgst
Wenn dich niemand hier versteht, wenn du niemanden verstehst
Willkommen in Deutschland, jetzt wird alles cool
Man ich hab noch Staub von der Heimat auf den Schuh'n
Ich dacht wirklich mein Leben ist hier sicher
Doch dann kam die Angst vor Abschiebung, beten und zittern

Kurdo,"Es waren zwei Brüder, Rashid und Aziz, 
Flüchtlinge aus 'nem kleinen Dorf Falastin's. 
Von klein auf hatten sie Respekt in der Ader, 
keine Widerrede, sie hören auf ihren Vater
Sie gehen Freitag gemeinsam zur Moschee, 
bitten um Vergebung für den toten Bruder ein Gebet. 
Aziz, der jeden Morgen ganz allein im Bus sitzt will mal Arzt werden, weil es Mama's Wunsch ist
Und Rashid will sich als Mann rächen, 
nach der Schule will er für sein Land kämpfen. 
Das Geld ist knapp, doch sie kämpfen weiter. 
Teilen sich das Pausenbrot, teilen sich die Kleider
Die Mutter oft allein', traurig, sie weint dann. 
Sie wünscht sich eine Tochter, dann wär' sie nicht mehr einsam. Sie betet zu Gott, sie nahm' ihr dein Geschenk und ein Jahr später kommt Lydia auf die Welt

Wir machen so vieles falsch, doch verzeihen wenig
Die Zeit vergeht, der Zeiger dreht sich
Du veränderst dich, doch merkst's erst wenn's zu spät ist
Wenn es dann zu spät ist bereuen wir es ewig

Wir machen so vieles falsch, doch verzeihen wenig
Die Zeit vergeht, der Zeiger dreht sich
Du veränderst dich, doch merkst's erst wenn's zu spät ist
Wenn es dann zu spät ist bereuen wir es ewig

Ja die Zeit vergeht, mit Tränen und Lächeln
Lydia ist jetzt Vier, lernt langsam zu sprechen
Aziz ist jetzt 20 studiert Medizin, Mama zu liebe, 
ja einfach aus Prinzip
Rashid ist jetzt 18, trägt mit sich ein Messer, 
macht nur noch Probleme, seine Freunde sind Verbrecher. 
Nur noch dieses eine Mal, dann der Ruhestand, er kauft 'ne Kette, 
für Lydia zum Geburtstag
Er küsst ihre Stirn, legt sie auf den Schoß, 
„Ich beschütz dich, jeden Tag, ich schwörs auf mein' Tod“, 
Rashid nimmt die Regeln der Familie nicht mehr ernst, deswegen wird Rashid von der Familie entehrt
Ja die Zeit vergeht auch ohne ihn, 
erfällt tiefer und tiefer und tiefer, einbrechen, Drogen dealen. 
Ja es war Rashid, der Junge aus dem Krieg, 
in Geld und Ruhm verliebt, vom Teufel besiegt

Wir machen so vieles falsch, doch verzeihen wenig
Die Zeit vergeht, der Zeiger dreht sich
Du veränderst dich, doch merkst's erst wenn's zu spät ist
Wenn es dann zu spät ist bereuen wir es ewig

Wir machen so vieles falsch, doch verzeihen wenig
Die Zeit vergeht, der Zeiger dreht sich
Du veränderst dich, doch merkst's erst wenn's zu spät ist
Wenn es dann zu spät ist bereuen wir es ewig

Es sind Acht Jahre her, es hat sich nichts verändert. 
Es bleibt wie es ist, Rashid bleibt ein Fremder. 
Lydia ist jetzt 12, heute auf dem Schulweg, 
glaub mir die letzten Zeilen hier, sie tun weh
Es ist Freitags morgens, auf der Straße nichts los. 
Rashid und Freunde kommen besoffen aus der Disko, 
sie steigen in den Wagen, ja sie sind zu viert, 
Rashid fährt und denkt sich „Was hab' ich zu verlieren?“
„Gib mal Gas, Junge, willst du mich verarschen?“, 
er gibt Gas und bemerkt da ist jemand auf der Straße. 
Er will stoppen, doch leider ist es zu spät, er trifft das Mädchen auf dem Schulweg

Wir machen so vieles falsch, doch verzeihen wenig

Wir waren Slumdogs, die Wasser aus der Hand trinken
In diesem Slum junge gibt es keinen Paragraph
Leb dein Leben, Lifestyle Bar-Allah
Ja, man wir liebten diesen Lifestyle
Tun was wir wollen, dreckig und frei sein
Wir hatten keinen Spielplatz
Leben Stil extrem, wir spielten auf dem Bordstein Benz zählen
Fünf beste Freunde, wir hatten keine Kinokarten
Einer nahm das Geld und vier mussten vor'm Kino warten
Wenn er raus kommt, erzählt er uns den Film
Er bewegt sich wie im Film, man das Leben war so wild
Spring um dein Leben, von Gartenzaun zu Gartenzaun
Mit vollen Tüten, Früchte aus dem Garten klauen
Kämpfen war Alltag, meine Straße gegen Deine
Deswegen haben wir Narben auf dem Kopf von den Steinen

Wir haben im Schlamm gespielt, haben uns am Fluss gewaschen
Meine Kindheit war ein Traum, ich würd’ es keine Stunde hassen
Diese Jungs die gegen Regel verstoßen, wurden von zu Hause aus mit Schlägen erzogen
Wir lernten schnell, auf der Straßen gibt es kein Vertrauen
Ja, auf der Straße haben wir nach der Schule Eis verkauft
Pyjamahose, Unterhemd, scheiß drauf ich muss weiter Sparen
Gutes Essen, schicke Kleider gab es nur an Feiertagen
Und wir sahen wie Helikopter übers Land fliegen
Man wir taten so als würden wir sie abschießen
Ich habs geliebt, schlafen auf dem Dach
Der Sonnenschein am Morgen, die Straße macht uns wach
Bei den Nachbarn essen, zu Vertieft in Armut
Scheißt drauf wir hatten Spass, Fußball spielen barfuß
Nach dem Spiel gab es Eis oder Tee, ausruhen
Und dann liefen wir Gemeinsam zur Moschee

Mir kommt es vor, als wäre ich wieder am Anfang
Deine Fotos, ich falte sie, ich versteck sie zwischen alten Jeans
Ich habe Angst, dass sie mein Vater sieht
Weißt du was mich von den anderen unterscheidet
Ich schwöre, Schatz, ich wollte nie, dass du leidest
Ich wollte nicht, dass dich irgendein Bastard anfasst
Deswegen war ich manchmal anders
Du bist nicht mehr meins, ja, es tut weh
Doch ich bete jeden Tag, dass es dir gut geht
Mein letzter Wunsch wäre eine Stunde mit dir
Ich leg dich schlafen und gebe dir ein Kuss auf die Stirn
Ohne dich hab ich Angst, wenn es regnet, Schatz
Tagsüber bin ich tot, ich lebe nachts
Freunde, ablenken, damit hab ich es auch versucht
Und trotzdem kriege ich nachts kein Auge zu

Hey, du bist weit weg
Ich würde gern wissen was du machst und wo du steckst
Doch du bist nicht da (Doch du bist nicht da)
Und ich komm nicht klar (Und ich komm nicht klar)

Es ist für dich, ich red mit dir in diesem Liebessong
Ich Schau' aus dem Fenster in der Hoffnung, dass du wiederkommst
Meine größte Angst war, dass ich dich verlier'
Und genau das ist dann auch passiert
Ich seh' dich in meinem Traum, ja ich sehe das brave Mädchen
Und jetzt soll ich so tun als wärst du nie da gewesen
Wie soll das gehen, es tut weh, du weißt es
Ich hab dich jeden Morgen auf dem Schulweg begleitet
Ich kriege keine Antwort von dir, ich habe Angst
Ich würde so gerne wissen was du grade machst
Ohne dich vergehen Stunden wie Tage
Ich sitze ganz alleine im Dunkeln und warte, warte
Ja ich warte auf ein Zeichen
Ich schwöre eine Nachricht würde reichen
Ich dachte, wenn du wegbleibst fickt es nicht mein Herz
Doch seitdem vermisse ich dich mehr

Hey, du bist weit weg
Ich würde gern wissen was du machst und wo du steckst
Doch du bist nicht da (Doch du bist nicht da)
Und ich komm nicht klar (Und ich komm nicht klar)

Kurious was never one for ring around
The rosie, not Josey, but I mosey on down
To a meadow where the flowers stay wilted
So what I ain't hit as many skins as Wilt the Stilt did
It's like that, never labelled a wack
And yo, they choose behind my back to do the Duckville quack
My style is cool, sweet like a ???
But still (what?) you gossip like a bitch
Mental stimulation when I'm rollin with the rat pack
If you're frontin rock, get the doodoo out your knap sack
The fat track provided by the Beat' got you goin
'nuts kickin butts, underneath be when I'm flowin
I'm knowin, you frontin-ass ducks is gettin smeared
My crew rolls thick like a hillbilly's beard
Constipated Monkeys gettin to the point quick
Like my man Apache said: yo, get off (MY DICK!)

It's like that and - ah
Didn't go to Georgia, took the train to Alabama
On the midnight tip like Gladys Knight and the Pips
My sole intention bein to move the marrow in your hips
Family confusion's what motivates the rhymer
Got an aunt named Tom, uncle named Jemima
Kurious Jorge on the welfare line
Plus American Airline never prepared mine
Ears for the poppin, hands for the clappin
If I sense turbulence, commence to see the captain
Two strikes, your motion got a notion of funk
I must prescribe a mint (why?) cause your breath stunk
(Ill) I paid the bills, sent a check to my mama
If you try to wreck my mind, there's mad drama
I'ma deliver one worm for the hawk
Eliminatin quacks on the duck walk

I drop limes like you drop mescaline
Tabs on my tongue as I swung from the swing
And came up with that thing they call 'Walk Like a Duck'
Quite frankly don't give a fuck
Mama raised me humble, so I never ever label
Myself as the best, cause some of the rest got more flavor
But that's okay, beyond a shadow of a doubt
I got skills, I ain't conceited, but still might take you out
Half Puertorican, half Cuban, not Fidel
Castro, like an astro you know I excel
Time to sell mad units, scratchin on my pubics
Complicate confusion like a ?Nick Kubrick? on a Rubik
Who kicks the bubbles that allow the truth to surface?
I never will delete, so I don't defeat the purpose
Slapshot the gift like a hockey puck

I was naive, kinda young, mighta even brung
Flowers to your door, but be damn sure
Those days are no more, so classify em as ancient history
Mysery was caused cause your wack way of thinkin
Breath stinkin cause I'm sittin here drinkin
A 40 gettin naughty, then my thoughts start linkin
Together, back-trackin, never was into girl-slappin
Releasin tension by grabbin the mic and rappin
Gifts with ribbons, when will this madness cease
You played me like a pair of Lee's with a permanent crease

Never makin any attemps to show love
But that's okay, see, I'm not a first grader
Don't need attention, need not mention that I'm greater
So later for that, cause I'm not the type for braggin
Just like my jeans my self-esteem was saggin
Pick up a 40 or a six of the stout draught
My life was hittin, know what exactly I'm talkin about
The style that flips, the sips of the 40 ounce
To the bounce I got more, so I score
One thing's for sure: understand and comprehend
Before you play yourself like a trend I send
A little word of advice, Fisher Price toy I'm not
Man, I ain't a boy, thought you mighta forgot
The song I sing cause your ill mood swings low

Play the role of Santa Clause, so save the drama

After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one

Love is wild in her. I confuse her love with the sea.
She is a rare and emerald fantasy told to me
and to me it seems that she lives in a mystery.

But her kisses! I dig her kisses.
While washing the dishes or feeding the fishes.
It's her kisses. Her k-k-k-k-k-k-kisses.
It's her kisses. Kisses that'll make you holler loudly
that you're glad enough to be a man.

Vs. 2
And in the evening - later - after dark
she quietly reveals to me all her miracles
Flying all up around me everywhere,
just like a fountain springing up around my eyes - a love!
I'm in a shower of a lovely one.
She makes the sun rise and set for me.

Oh, gotta' make her stay
because she's got a wiggle that'll make a clock stop.
I dig her even when we're apart.
Digging on my baby's really getting me high
& making me sigh & helping me fly
back to the woman who could tease old Frankenstein's suture-boy to living.

Moxie is as moxie does & she is moxie with the kind of moxie love she's giving.
And I know she'll never ever need forgiving
with kisses that will make you say you're glad enough to be a man.

Vs. 3
And she giggles when she talks.
And she's happy if we go to the races & party or not.
And she squeezes all the living daylights out of me.
And if I ever should sever the tether that keeps us together
forever where never a tear or a sorrow could weather
the amorist passion that flashes from in her eyes
- I'd be a dunce -
if i should ever try to walk or try to stray into any other woman's arms.

Because I dig her kisses -
the kind that I like because they're warm & tasty
and they're good and chewy and I like 'em.
And you would dig them too, if you could ever get
a kiss from my sweet miss.
But we will be kissing and kissing & so you'll never ever
get a taste of heaven - that I know & guarantee that you will never see.

A bucket of loving is what she brings to me. She is my sweetie.
with kissing - loving - hugging that'l make you glad just to be a man.

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

They live only for the dream of living so come follow where they will take you there.

In the eye if the hurricane to know despair,

He knew all the dreams by heart just like sailing in a boat of
crystal silence seeing visions of the world of life within a life.

In a turning like a burning came turning 
Out of everything stirring and what had begun before

But all wrapped up in one great godly becoming -
Tumbling and fumbling and stumbling
Into bumbling and rumbling along -

Whirling it and swirling it and twirling it and hurling it 
And overturning it and burning it again.

I shared a whirling dervish out on the side of a hill called metaphor vivace
Swinging en route to a nascent solar with the scissored visored blizzard wizard 
Gizzarding planets and secrets within like an avatar.

While meanwhile in turn styling and spinning over him
Spells bespeaking kingdoms in the dark

Calling me to yield knighting me in a field covered with armies
And with princes. All were signing cannons shining pennants flying.

And when he spoke to me he sang and his words really rang -
This child of the knowledge of the beauty of the night -

He sang to me of masters passing on of father after father after father
Climbing up into the lotus bloom upon the tortoise's back

And of grandfathers who danced through their living a longer time ago.
He showed me a palace in time in which all the talismans
From all the zeuses swing upon a pendulum of secrets
In a circle that remembers and when asked a question will surren",Night Dreamer

that love was sent from above
yet, today, find my love has flown away

Something deep inside
Cannot be denied

All who love are absolutely blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realise

And I gayly laughed
that they would doubt my love

love will leave you
crying in your sleep
once you're in too deep
love will leave lost and lonely
love will break your heart

love will make you fall apart 
the moment that you stop belonging
nothing ends the pain
tearing you away
wondering where you made your big mistake

promises go far
now, she's gone

I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

And all it meant to me

until you've flipped your heart

Let's catch the wind
An evening breath 
On naked skin
Out where the sun 
Meets the Monterey Sea
A dream / that's as real as can be

On the way

The blue will shade 
A touch of jade
And make a sight
Very few ever see

Tonight 
When the sky meets the sea 

We can glide 
Though ocean sky
And cover waves 
With ocean eyes
Out where the moon 
Meets the wondering sea

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer

Starring you and me
The hero is struggling to say, that his lady is far away
In her prison of wishes

We're loving, we fight but it's all day for night
Just to masquerade
We're reel till the red light is off, then we go, take our faces off
Like two clowns in a side show

Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Just another Technicolor, role man's on the screen
Love is like two dreamers dreaming the same dream
Just another Technicolor, romance, romance on the screen

Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Just another Technicolor, romance on the screen

I keep you in frame and I whisper your name
Till the picture fades
The feeling is already gone, I don't know why I'm going on
Can't remember the ending

Kurt Elling,"Where is your heart, my love?
I can’t believe you’ would forget
I haven’t finished with love yet
And I’m wondering where, where can you be?

I still see your smile in my memories and photographs
Pictures of hand holding laughter
I guess there’s more that you're after
But you're teaching my songs to cry

Making love with you was easy, it was a thrill
And I guess that’s how it goes, hearts break every day
I just thought you’d go just a bit more gently
And I hoped you’d pick up the telephone if I called

My angel, where can you be? You have flown out
Out of time, out of love, out of my arms
Leaving me with a heart full of empty
So where baby, where are you?

And now, starting now and my whole life through
Must I go on just pretending, where is my happy ending?
All I wanted to play from long ago was your true love Romeo
I need you baby, but darling where, baby, where are you?
Where are you? Where is the dream we started?

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

You find yourself lost in despair

So take a dive 
You're surrounded by water
You need to find peace of mind
It won't kill you if you give it a try

So, baby run
Run like the wind
Looking what you're leaving behind
It's nothing more than a hole in the ground

It's too late
There's nothing to hold on to
It's so sad
'Cause everything's shut down
It's so hard
'Cause everythig you know is here
You find yourself lost in despair

It's too late
There's nothing to hold on to
It's so sad
'Cause everything's shut down
It's so hard
'Cause everything you know is here
You find yourself lost in despair

You find yourself lost in despair
You find yourself lost",Lost in Despair
Kurt Nilsen,"Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly.
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say,
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
Left me in the vacuum of my heart.

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say,
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Feared today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

(Just blown away)

And I don't
But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.

Every world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world
Every world is my world",Ordinary World
Kurt Nilsen,"She's blood, flesh and bones
No tucks or silicone
She's touch smell sight taste and sound
But somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know we're right where I belong and nothing's gonna happen, yeah
Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high
High above me
First class, fancy free, she's high society
She's got the best of everything
Why could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be, why should I even bother, ah ha
Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high
High above me
She comes to speak to me
I freeze immediately
Cause what she says sounds so unreal
Cause somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know we're right below and nothing's gonna happen
Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high
High above me

I've done nothing wrong

You create a wall
That's too hard to crack

New lifestyle, to make you new
Those sad eyes, when I'm with you

We had it all going our way
But now it hurts to tell you
Oh my god, it hurts to tell you, yeah

Wake up and smell the roses
This was too good to be true

It doesn't bother me at all

How am I gonna prove, this ain`t no lie

Kurt Nilsen,"The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
But there's no room
No space to rent in this town
You're out of luck 
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck 
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day, the sky falls
You feel like it's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road 
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination
You love this town 
Even if it doesn't ring true
You've been all over 
And it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day

Touch me 
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by clouds
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouins fires at night
See the oil fields at first sight
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out 
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

Do you have to go away?
Stay stay for tomorrow. 
Then I will know, if I'd rather be alone.

Take, take a moment of time and turn it back 
So we can start from scratch 
Suppose, I'll leave all I've got 
Would it make it easier on your heart? 

Well I'll take what I can before you leave
If that is just a smile 
I'll stay up all night, so I can watch you breathe 
If that is alright
Come on and show me that silky skin 
You're oh so fine
I know we could turn it right 
I know we could turn it right 

Throw; throw me a lifeline way out to sea 
Would you save me if it all goes wrong? 
Grab, grab me 'cause I'm yours 
Forever that's for sure
Because that's what I want you to tell me 

Well I'll take what I can before you leave 
If that is just a smile
I'll stay up all night so I can watch you breathe 
If that is alright
Come on and show me that silky skin 
You're oh so fine 
I know we could turn it right 
I know we could turn it right 

But it's all an illusion 
Easier said than done

Is it worth giving it a try?

Kurt Nilsen,"See the morning sun from my window
Not a cloud for a mile or two 
Wearing out my slippers when I walk 
But that what they're supposed to do 
What is the purpose and what am I doing here 
When I ought to be at work 
I'm going round and round in circles all day 
Can't stop thinking about where it hurts 

Look ahead 
Is this what I want to do for the rest of my life? 
Well that's not right 
Look ahead 
Does it mean that I'm afraid to give it a try?
Just a try 

I'm taking a sickleave; I got to make the call 
Just let them know that this is too hard 
I can't figure out what in gonna say 
'Cause telling them lies will end up bad anyway 
A little scared as I dial up the phone 
Saying that the fever has got to my bones 
I'm sweating like a pig 
When you return my call 
Get well soon and take the day off 

Look ahead 
Is this what I want to do for the rest of my life? 
That's not right 
Look ahead 
Does it mean that I'm afraid to give it a try? 
Just a try 

I'm keeping a straight face trying to seem real 
Enjoying my self well here is the deal 
I'm never ever going back there again 
No, no, mm, mm, no way at all 
I'm never ever going back there again 
I got to be honest with myself

Kurt Nilsen,"How many times have I seen?
You only get to keep the ones that you love
So if not, why bother.
If you could pick and choose from the top of the shelf
It wouldn't have worked because you'd be aiming too high
You really want someone you like

For you
For you

I see you right there, with broken eyes 
What are you trying to do to yourself?
please forget it and move on
You always want the things hard to get, and when you get them, 
You want something else, whatever that may be

For you
For you 

For You
For you

All this time, where did it go?
I can't believe my eyes, but you know I'm here for you

May the best of luck, may it guide you on your way, wherever that may lead

For the better, for some peace

See the old guy with the broom in his hand
Cleaning up what's left
And the cavalry with my bad boys once again
Oh, I feel so complete
Here on my street
I call it my street

I will always be right here
I will always be right here
I will always be right here
Here on my street
I call it my street

Fell in love for the first time of my life
Here on this bench
Said to myself I will always find the time
And then she moved away
From my street
From my street

I will always be right here
I will always be right here
I will always be right here
Here on my street

Many years have gone, I glance back to see
Growing up here was good
Many people say that don't you ever forget it
Try to come back soon

I will always be right here
I will always be right here
I will always be right here
Here on my street
I call it my street

I stop and stare, walking down the road again
