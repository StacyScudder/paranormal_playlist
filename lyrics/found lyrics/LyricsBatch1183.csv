Status Quo,"People all around they look at you, and I have seen them sneer
But they don't realize how much I need you, so let me make it very clear
That you won't have to worry just ''cause your clothes are torn

Your windows they need cleaning and the weeds are growing high
But Little Miss Nothing I won't pass you by

You have no daddy to tell your troubles to, but don't you worry I'll share
them with you
We won't worry about the stormy weather, if you have troubles we'll share
them together
Your house is nearly falling, but I'll change all that for you

Your windows they need cleaning and the weeds are growing high
But Little Miss Nothing I won't pass you by
Now I will clean your windows, cut the weeds from high to low
I will mend your rooftops, and the taps again will flow
But Little Miss Nothing I won't let you go",Little Miss Nothing [Stereo]
Status Quo,"There's a man sitting in a concrete room
In a place full of emptiness and gloom
With his head in his hands he's far away
It's a long time ago since yesterday

And now his hands, now his hands start to fall
In his world of nothing at all
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall
In his world of nothing at all

As a boy he had made so many friends
Now they're gone loneliness just never ends
And in that cold concrete room he trials the day
Yes, the price of a life is hard to pay

And now his hands, now his hands start to fall
In his world of nothing at all
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall
In his world of nothing at all

Close your eyes, there's nothing more to see
Close your eyes and thank the world you're free

There's a man sitting in a concrete room
In a place full of emptiness and gloom
With his head in his hands he's far away
It's a long time ago since yesterday

And now his hands catch the tears that start to fall
In his world of nothing at all
And now his hands catch the tears that start to fall
In his world of nothing at all
And now his hands, like the tears start to fall
In his world of nothing at all
Yes, now his hands, like the tears start to fall
In his world of nothing at all
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall
In his world of nothing at all
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall
In his world of nothing at all
Yes, now his hands.....",Nothing At All [Mono Version]
Status Quo,"In a world of education there's no time for compassion
Life's a fire, never ending, bringing pain and then befriending
And like a fire that burns no light
And drifts to heaven, so ends another life

Is there time to care, it's only fair that life goes on
And on and on and on 'til in the end you can't go on

So ends another life to let this world go on
Don't cry for pity my friend, you never gave none

There's a hunter with his gun pointing upwards to the sun
Thinks a bird can feel no pain, if it can it won't again
And like a fire that burns no light
And drifts to heaven, so ends another life

Is there time to care, it's only fair that life goes on
And on and on and on 'til in the end you can't go on

So ends another life to let this world go on
Don't cry for pity my friend, you never gave none
So ends another life to let this world go on
Don't cry for pity my friend, you never gave none
So ends another life to let this world go on
Don't cry for pity my friend .....",So Ends Another Life [Stereo Version]
Status Quo,"There's an emerald sky
Silver birds flying by
Purple trees all around
Velvet grass on the ground

Then I see a face, of the girl who's calling me
And love is in my eyes for this girl was just a dream

When I awake she is gone
And I return to reality
When I awake she is gone
Because it's just a dream, a fantasy

Then the morning light
Slowly flows into night
And I close my eyes
And reality dies

Again I see the face of the girl who's calling me
And now she's in my arms but this love can never be

When I awake she is gone
And I return to reality
When I awake she is gone
Because it's just a dream, a fantasy

Again I see the face of the girl who's calling me
And now she's in my arms but this love can never be

When I awake she is gone
And I return to reality
When I awake she is gone
Because it's just a dream, a fantasy
When I awake...",When I Awake [Stereo]
Status Quo,"Hey little woman
You're just what I was looking for today
I needed someone
And you're just what I was looking for today

Good things seem to happen to you
When you just happen to run along livin' right
But if you wait too long you know that
When you turn around you find you have lost them in life

The sun may have to shine
But the visions in my eyes were painted gray
Now listen to the lightning
You're just what I was looking for today

We could drift away together
Where you and I could be alone

Nothing that is real applies
Need for nothing [Incomprehensible]
We could drift away
Undo the world of lines

Hey little woman
You just what I was looking for

",You're Just What I Was Looking For Today [Stereo]
Status Quo,"You never seem, seem to have the time to listen to what I say
How can I know just what goes on in your mind if you always walk away
So what's the good, what's the good of trying
And hanging around you begging for your love
When it seems there's someone else in your dreams
And I can't be sure of you anymore

Are you growing tired of my love?
Have you had too much of my love?
Are you growing tired of my love?
Where is the love you once gave me?

And when we meet, things are not the same now, you always hurry away
And all the friends that once you used to share with me are ignored now, and you're bored now
I guess we are through, but still I go on hoping
Because you never put it into words
Can't you see you should be honest with me
And I've got to find what is in your mind

Are you growing tired of my love?
Have you had too much of my love?
Are you growing tired of my love?
Where is the love you once gave me?

Are you growing tired of my love?
Have you had too much of my love?
Are you growing tired of my love?
Where is the love you once gave me?

Status Quo,"Drop your silver in my tambourine
Help a poor man fill a little dream
Give me pennies, I'll take anything
Now listen while I play my green tambourine

Watch the jingle-jangles start to chime
Reflections of the music that was mine
When I toss a coin you'll hear it sing
Now listen while I play my green tambourine

Rub-a-dub before I walk away
Anytime you want, I'll gladly play
Money feeds my music machine
Now listen while I play my green tambourine
Listen while I play my green tambourine",Green Tambourine
Status Quo,"When you look at me tell me what you see
Do you see a man or just a jagged outline of one?
Do you hear my words, or do they go straight through you?

We get it together now and then
But I can feel we won't again
Still I can't stop this endless strain of you

Listen to my words and talk the sadness that I bring you
I'll leave you today, 'cos I am nothing to you

Oh-oh make me stay a bit longer
Make my heart and my body get stronger
Make me stay, don't send me away or I'll be alone
Make me stay a bit longer
Make my heart and my body get stronger
Make me stay, don't send me away or I'll be alone

Where I can put those people of my mind

And sleep that stops my head from spinning round

I just wanna be left on my own
Leave me to a life that's mine alone.

You feel a little pain inside
And now our heads are whirring
It's done, there's no returning
You feel the little pain - it dies

Shy fly keep on smiling, gonna keep on smiling every day
Shy fly keep on smiling, you're gonna keep on smiling every day

But teasing and back-biting makes loving much more fun
Fly gets him together, and Tiger thinks he's won
But Fly, she keeps on smiling, he's not the only one

The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
Costs you more when you're to blame

You're happy now but that won't last
You talk too much, you laugh too loud
You see her face in every crowd

Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

I saw this picture in a magazine
With it's gold plated grovers

So I, I did my home work
And I worked like hell

I got that blues and rhythm
Good enough to eat
Sound and vision
Hit me with the backbeat

From those nights in Tienanmen Square.
It's coming from the feel
That this ain't exactly real,
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.
From the wars against disorder,
From the sirens night and day,
From the fires of the homeless,
From the ashes of the gay,
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming through a crack in the wall,
On a visionary flood of alcohol,
From the staggering account
Of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all.
It's coming from the silence
On the dock of the bay,
From the brave, the bold, the battered
Heart of Chevrolet:
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the sorrow in the street,
The holy places where the races meet,
From the homicidal bitching
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat.
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away,
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

Sail on, sail on
Oh mighty Ship of State!
To the Shores of Need
Past the Reefs of Greed
Through the Squalls of Hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on. 

It's coming to America first,
The cradle of the best and of the worst.
It's here they got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst.
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open

But they don't realize how much I need you
So let me make it very clear that you won't have to worry
Just 'cause your clothes are torn

Your windows, they need cleaning
And the weeds are growing high
But Little Miss Nothing, I won't pass you by

You have no daddy to tell your troubles to
But don't you worry, I'll share them with you
We won't worry about the stormy weather
If you have troubles we'll share them together
Your house is nearly falling but I'll change all that for you

Your windows, they need cleaning
And the weeds are growing high
But Little Miss Nothing, I won't pass you by

I will mend your rooftops and the taps again will flow

Status Quo,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far

But she loves her rock and roll
You say what you want
But she's gonna take control

Gotta run, gotta hide, get outside of town
Somewhere we go she isn't far behind
Seems like another day in paradise
Another day for me to lose my mind
Now she'd be there, anywhere, didn't have a chance
And I believe everybody knows
She is the girl that you can't ignore

Status Quo,"Down at backwater junction
Rolling down the line
In the dark early morning
I heard the one-forty-nine
I was walking down the highway
Needed somewhere to go
A lady laid beside me
And she invited me home
She led me cold, tired and hungry
Down the backwater road

In a house on the corner
Looking over the track
I woke up with a fever
And a pain in my back
She was lying there beside me
My fever started to grow
Had a funny feeling
But the lady said no
The lover needs a doctor
Down the backwater road

Whatcha lookin' for?
Whatcha lookin' for?
Lady do you know whatcha lookin' for?
Was I wrong to play along?
Lady was I right or lady was I wrong?

You've got me breathing in time
It's ten-thirty in the morning
And I'm feeling alright
I went back to my lady
But I wasn't to know
Lady left this morning
And she's not coming home
I was cold when she left me

Wenn ich durch das Fenster seh'.
Und ich fall' nochmal in jene Sekunde,
In der ich wusste, du gehst.

Du hast doch schon so oft vor jedem Sturm
Deine Angst in meine Arme gelegt.
Bei jedem Wind, den ich spür', frag' ich mich,
Wer jetzt mit dir durch den Regen geht.

Wie lange tut es noch weh?
Und wann geht es vorbei?
Wie lange braucht die Zeit,
Um uns're Wunden zu heil'n,
Bis man sie irgendwann vergisst?

Manchmal wenn ich Lieder schreibe,
Fühlt es sich so einfach an.
Doch wenn ich dann die Augen schließe,
Fängt wieder alles von vorne an.

Ich geh' noch so oft dorthin zurück,
Wo wir wie auf Wolken schwebten.
Und ich seh' uns immer noch hier,
So als hätte es nie
Einen Abschied gegeben.

Wie lange tut es noch weh?
Und wann geht es vorbei?
Wie lange braucht die Zeit,
Um uns're Wunden zu heil'n,
Bis man sie irgendwann vergisst?

Sag' mir, dass die Zeit Wunden heilt
Und der Schmerz, den ich spür' nicht bleibt.
Wann ist mein Herz wieder frei?
Wie lange tut es noch weh?
Und wann geht es vorbei?
Wie lange braucht die Zeit,
Um uns're Wunden zu heil'n?

Oft dasselbe gefühlt.
Wollten alles übersteh'n,
Egal wohin uns das auch führt.
Haben nächtelang geredet,
Schliefen erst am Morgen ein.
Konnten uns doch blind verstehen,
Wollten uns doch alles verzeih'n.

Und ich frag' mich, warum.
Mir nichts weiter bleibt als Staub.
Denn zwischen Tränen und Vergessen
Hätt' ich so gern an uns geglaubt.
Und ich frag' mich, warum,
Unser Paradies zerfällt.
War es denn nur auf Sand gebaut?
Denn zwischen Tränen und Vergessen
Hätt' ich so gern an uns geglaubt.

Ich wär' gern bei dir geblieben,
Hab' dich so gerne angeseh'n.
Manchmal haben wir geschwiegen
Und dabei stundenlang erzählt.
Ich hab' irgendwie gewusst,
Das wird nicht für ewig sein.
Hab' mich gut damit belogen.
War lieber einsam als allein.

Stavesacre,"It's opening time down on Fascination Street 
So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit 
Cause I feel it all fading and paling and I'm begging to 
Drag you down and kick the last nail in 

I like you in that like I like you to scream 
And if you open your mouth I cannot be responsible 
For quite what comes in or to care what comes out 
So put on your head and put on your pout 

And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over 
If you slip going under slip over my shoulder 
Put on your face Put on your fear and let's hit opening time 
Down on Fascination Street 

Kick the last nail in drag you down with me

You know my way... 
It's just my way 

Restless, tense, and shifting in my seat 
Changing times fight bottom lines fight dreams 
And darlin' you won't hear my voice tonight 
Even that is held just out of reach 

(chorus) 
But if you should wake one day to find 
You don't see yourself as mine 
If you should need to leave my side 
You'd leave a better man behind 

All I've seen and known I would make ours 
But for each thing that blesses, more leave scars 
And baby, we could just stay home tonight 
I found some softness in world so hard 

No one sees us making this 
I feel it, and see it in their eyes 
But I won't lose sleep if when they see you 
They don't see me 
I won't mind 

I found an island in a sea of failing coals 
A fire that never dies before it's grown 
And I'm just another soul that's come in from the cold 
Seeking shelter from the coming storms ",Island
Stavesacre,"Couples gather on the street,
No way they notice me.
But I watch them walk together
And it reminds me,
Of nights when everyone was gone
And I ended up alone

To hold for anything

But lately I have noticed
That so much is not what
I'd imagined it to be
When the harder times come calling on us
We'll know if we're gonna need…

Promises
Don't promise me
Say yes, say no or yes
But don't promise…

For all the reason not to try
I can't forget the times, I swore
That if I finally knew
The answers to my prayers those nights,
When it came time to decide
I just know
That I would be ready…

That so much is not what

Fast livin' got me trapped in this street game 
Before i die i hope i have a chance to make a change 
4x 
I'm at the time in my life when a nigga ready to change 
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this thang 
feel like I'm trapped in a prison slowly waiting to die 
it's getting harder for my people yet we don't know why 
they cuttin sistas off welfare these kids can't eat 
and it's the children like thuggish minds turned out by the street 
I couldn't see it while I was outside slangin my rocks 
servin' death to my people, commitin the ultimate evil 
robbin' and killin' my own kind, Lord forgive me 
blinded by this life of crime, God somebody hear me 
since the death of my momma, my life is filled with drama 
lost both of my kids, punished for what dirt that I did 
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget 
all the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase 
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game 
Steady checkin' myself, God help me to change 
Chorus 4x 
If I could change, I'd bring my momma back from the grave 
I ain't got too much trouble cause we livin' in the last days 
crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these 
days 
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress 
jealous fool of the world trying to put me to rest 
last night i had a talk with my momma 
then the cry, asking god if she'd serve a purpose before she dies 
you can see it in my eyes, a brotha wanta slow down 
I ain't mad at ya daddy cause you didn't come around 
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it 
You see the opportunity, you take it 
but what about my little baby, I got a mouth to feed 
But i still wanta hang on the streets and smoke weed with the O.G.'s 
my homies rest in peace in the game 
I don't think you'll ever know the pain 
I wanta change 
Chorus 4x 
Lord know, picute me ballin 
trapped in this ghetto with my young G's callin 
Henacee and weed when they bury P 
a quarter key, 6 G's, when they carry me 
fall on my knees to no nigga 
trapped in this hood, raised by chrome trigga 
never had a pops, a nigga learned to slang cream 
should have been a chemist, the way i work a triple beam 
life, is like a page, I wanta turn 
I wanta make a change, but Lord you let my brotha burn 
I done seen a nigga lose his life over zurcubian stones 
everynight, my auntie bring a nigga home 
momma worrying cause the rent late 
3 strikes, my cousin's doing time upstate 
I sent him Camel with no filters 
I'm in the ghetto slangin dope with staight killas, ugghh 
I know kids that pack gats cause they bout it, bout it 
I'm from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy, rowdy 
is there a heaven for a gangsta, Lord put me to sleep 
cause your best friend turn into your enemy

Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot

Stealers Wheel,"We sat up talking right on through the night
And the day had just begun
Then you said let's take a walk outside
And watch the rising of the sun

And over my head there was so much to see in the sky
Just that feeling of being alive
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away

Stealers Wheel,"My daddy was a miner, said there was nothing finer
Than an Irishman who worked an honest day.
From Steamboat Row, in rain or shine, he'd make his way down to the mine,
Along the dusty road he'd travel,
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go,
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

He used to tell about the time he got hurt down in the mine,
He said he'd never go back down again.
But in his heart he knew he would, he did the only thing he could,
Kept on walkin' down that road,
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go,
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

But when he took to drinkin' we knew that he was thinkin',
That his days were quickly coming to an end.
He'd only speak of Steamboat Row, he said someday we ought to go,
And walk along that dusty road,
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go,
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

At the longer I waited, I thought I was led astray

That came down from the hills 
To kill and slaughter man 

But instead I beg you 
To keep your heart clean 
And make sure that the opposite 
Remind you of what I'll say 

Take my hand and we'll go back in time 
Just before the evil rituals 
Hold on tight and read my mind 
So you won't forget what I'll say 

Now! Help me find a way
To make you understand
The way that mankind's selfishness
Will make people all banned
Quick! Give me answers
To all my unsolved thoughts

I wanna thank you for the loving
That you spread over me

If you caught VD
You'll be screaming my name 
When you sit down to pee

Hey Michael Starr you motherfucker
Whoa, whoa

Suck my balls all night

It's a weenie ride

I want to sing about a thing that's funner than a swing 
And better than the monkey bars
You can take it on the couch or your water bed 
Or in the back of your Daddy's car
And it's open all day, night time too, seven fucking days a week
It only shuts down intermittently so I can take a leak

So put that snatch on a weenie ride
Ride her face down or on your side
You'll be amazed what you can fit in there
When some leverage is applied

Open your legs for a weenie ride
You won't be the first to see it and cry
Just bring the baby wipes and some Astroglide
It's a weenie ride, oh yeah

Scream for me
Scream out in ecstasy
Honey, won't you try the weenie ride
You're never gonna be the same
Baby, how you gonna get to heaven if you can't take a little pain?

Step right up for a weenie ride
It's even more fun when you're gagged and tied
Oops, I think I got a little dna
All over your backside

Go on and tell your friends about the weenie ride
You can charge admission, baby, I don't mind
Even with the big old muff you won't get tonight
For the weenie ride

Weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie ride (it's a weenie ride)
Weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie ride (come spread your thighs)
Weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie weenie ride (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

There was so much spunk on your face neither the boys nor I could see the tears

Ten extra sausage went to Shady Oak Drive

I twisted my nuts to keep from cumming to fast
I had my fist in a butthole til somebody said

When the stars are right and you're alone
Take a journey, lock the world up tight
Out of your mind.

The hall beckons your presence, the doors
Open wide you're to decide to turn back

Deep the bowels of this black abyss,
Compelled I just can't resist it, take me
Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within
Take me away

Drawing near someone passes through me,
A silent entity never looking back I won't dare.
Evil eyes staring through he walls of stone
As I feared I travel not alone

Laughter's echoes with the blatant wind
I have passed the threshold deep within me.
Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within
Take me away

A voice of thunder said turn back
Tabernacle is forbidden
No mortal dares to enter here.
I want to know

Flame is burning center of a fountain yearning, waters
Spring eternal, spiritual water physical fire
Above the center is sky, cold cold never-ness
Just vastness filled with stars upon stars

In the four corners of life are the golden mirrors
Reflecting what you are and what you are to be
In the first is a young boy white dove in
His hand, in the second is a warrior in Armour
In the third is the old man gold watch
In his hand fourth and last
No reflection at all
No reflection at all
No reflection at all

Waters rise toward physical fire, voice says
Tabernacle is forbidden never looking back I don't
Dare
If the water touches the flame
Forever in darkness yes I'll remain

White dove flies from the young boys hand
Through the mirror of the old man, only way out
Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within
Take me away
Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within
Take me away

Steel Prophet,"Born into this life a child in the world of doubt
Rejected as an orphan boy torn from his mothers side
Dogma thrown in his way obstacles from which to pass
The pain his soul endured
Has scarred his body fast
Defiant in an angry heart stubborn in his ways
Determined to reach his goals
Though numbered are his days
Lost within his mind 
Emotionally disturbed
Abused throughout childhood
Wounded deeply by words
Submerged in hate and fear
Neglected by those around
Affliction was all we had 
Lost and never found
But then something snapped within
And turned him inside out
To survive, life had to change
And mend his wounds somehow 
Rebellion against authority
To conform he would never submit
Punished by society 
Upon their face he'd spit
Scarred for life, wounded deep within
Healing the bludgeoned soul
Must somehow begin cry out in the night
Twisted in delusion crawling into the light
Scarred for life
Locked within his mind, a solitary prison cell
Depression fills him with despair
Falling to the depths of hell
Alone in a silent rage the final hours near
Desperate in insanity
He cries, but no one hears
Anger consumed his soul
In a violent state of mind
Destroyed his every thought
Soon running out of time
Lies he believed from voices in his head
Confused in chaos, wishing he was dead
Torn into this life a child in disarray
Blasphemed upon his soul
A victim of his ways

Oh children the fruit of the womb
There are things that you must know

I gave my pledge to you
And I never forget
The good times and the bad times
And even some regrets

Time has passed and we both knew
That there comes a time to change
And tough we're not together
Our love it still remains

So don't be afraid to say
What you need to tell me
'Cause maybe it's love that will work
This time around
It's easy for you to see

I lay my head on your shoulder
And my heart skips a beat
We've got to find love and make it last
Don't you know...
Don't think about defeat

So don't be afraid to try
Because it's a game where the strong
Do have to dwell
And maybe you'll find yourself
The future's waiting... who can tell

The future's waiting... who can tell
The future's waiting... who can tell

So don't be afraid to try
Because it's a game... where the strong
Do have to dwell
And maybe you'll find yourself

Said this love, it's appealing

And getting someone jealous

An expensive taste
Don't get what you want

Or the thing from outer space
A chauffeur-driven limousine
Seems more to be her style

You just ain't worth her while

Told your friends that I mistreated you
When it was you who was abusing me

I don't like the things you do to me - well!

But I wouldn't listen

And I shower you with money

He stopped at every single traffic light
He took the wrong turn

Born in imaha Nebraska
May 19 year 25
Was the son of a Garvey teacher
We will keep his name alice
Youthful years were full of adventure
Drifted to a life of crime
In jail he learned to be our leader
Thank God he was released on time

Spoke out gainst Jim Crows in justice
And never turned the other cheek
There's no room for non violent protest
Yes these words were what he preached
Taught us bout Pan Africanism
To put my people back on their feet
Take what's ours robbed by the system
He said by any means

Let Malcolm live through us
Black liberation is a must
Let Malcolm live through us
Black liberation is a must

They have tried to rid his name 
From history books and magazines
They even tried to criticize
His greatness and philosophy
Against all kinds of exploitation
For all of us he bore the pain
We won't let him be forgotten
No he did not die in vain

Put away the misconception
That he came to teach us hate
So wake up from your sleep and slumber
Wake up before its too late
We need to resurrect that spirit
A lease of life the people need
To fight resistance from the system

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know;

Dem chopping down OUR role models
In the belly of the beast in dis ya struggle
Dem a cutting down OUR role models

Cause every single time we make a stance now yeah arrh!
They always try their very best to catch us with our pants down woe
Want to smear our name
And denounce our fame
It's a crying shame
Hatred still remains
I'm charging dem rascals for libel and slander oh!

To turn our heroes into zero's

Why you stoop so low
I'm charging them rascals for libel and slander oh!

DJ RAP........
Listen to the thing that I'm about to confess
I hate and I despise and I deplore and detest
The tabloids and newspapers better known as the press
And so much propaganda that it leads to distress
Magic Johnson, Micheal Jordan, boom your the best
Advice to Micheal jackson keep your cards to your chest
Mr Iron Mike Tyson always under arrest
And vote fi Jesse Jackson him a next president
The plight of OJ Simpson caused a civil unrest
Police beat up Rodney King until his face was a mess
Defend yourself by any means and Malcolm say yes
I dare a man to ever curse a who JAH JAH bless
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
Dem just a mud up, mud up
Blood up blood up etc

Up ye mighty race
And wipe the dirt from your face
Never ever fall from grace
The mind is a terrible thing to waste (repeat)

In dis ya struggle

And what I see happening now
Seems like the world's gone crazy

Tricky politics fight their corner

Spiritualise it

But still they do the crimes
Drag the devil into health and fitness
Keep him safe all the time

We never get organised
Without a little positive resistance
To open up all our eyes

Scratching in our cage

I write to believe
In the love that I forget
And if you were the sky
Would you let my sun set?

Catch you on the other side
I feel you in my sleep
The colors in my lullaby
Will hold you 'til I get home
I'm coming home

Like a junkie in his cage
I'm itching to be saved
And for everyone I swallow
I'll turn another page

I write to believe
'Cause honey, you'll forget
The colors in her eyes
Before her sun sets

Catch you on the other side
I feel you in my sleep
The colors in my lullaby
Will hold you 'til I, home

Catch you on the other side

Catch you on the other side

So keep one eye open

Ain't what you got, no

To a man with a master plan
To run the world that I ran from

Last time I had left you
This time I'm leaving true
In a quest to lose it all

Can hold the way to your promise land
And my soul, mind
And body will render the crime

So why you gotta be so cruel?
You used me like a tool
It will never fix our love, no, no

I know that it's time to give it all up
When it all so corrupt
And I'm torn from child and lust

Time sublime when pain's a rhyme

Them stars would align for you

Keep that eye open
And keep them eyes open

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night.

There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way

Such a lovely face.
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Till your love reached higher than the wall

Higher than the wall a thousand feet tall
High above the darkness where the blue shadows fall
Your love reached higher, where it's better and brighter
Yeah, your love reached higher than the wall

Now I'm wearin' freedom instead of those chains
Empty reminders don't cause me no pain
It's all gone away like the leaves in the fall

He fairly won my heart, wrote me a letter
With his hammer in his hand he looked so clever

Oh where has my love gone with his cheeks like roses
He is gone across the sea gathering primroses
I'm afraid the shining sun might burn and scorch his beauty
And if I were with my love I would do my duty

Strange news flies up and down that my love is married
Oh I wish them both great joy, though they don't hear me
And if I were with my love I would do my duty

Steeleye Span,"As I walked down through Chatham Street
A fair maid I did meet,
She asked me to see her home--
She lived in Bleecker Street.
Chorus:
And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?
And when we got to Bleecker Street,
We stopped at forty-four,
Her mother and her sister there,
To meet her at the door.
Chorus:
And when I got inside the house,
The drinks were passed around,
The liquor was so awful strong,
My head went round and round.
Chorus:
And then we had another drink,
Before we sat to eat,
The liquor was so awful strong,
I quickly fell asleep.
Chorus:

I had an aching head,
There was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in me bed.
Chorus:
My gold watch and my pocketbook
And lady friend were gone;
And there was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in the room.
Chorus:
On looking round this little room,
There's nothing I could see,
But a woman's shift and apron
That were no use to me.

Down Cherry Street forlorn,
There Martin Churchill took me in,
And sent me 'round Cape Horn.

Listen to my story and I'll tell you why,

They said I wouldn't see him for a long long time.
Chorus: They said he's gone to America,
To work the land that some called Virginia;
They said he's gone to America.
Married him in April, lost him in July;
They took him as their prisoner then told me why,
They said they had sent him where poachers go,
I asked if I could see him but they said no.

Where only long breezes reach out to me.

Steeleye Span,"The priests go down to the river to fish for Friday's meal
The King is brooding day and night
Black with hate, cursing fate
To be ill when the foe is in sight.

The priests they kneel in the chancel in solemn peaceful prayer
The King is laughing, grim and slow
Three brothers die, he hung them high
On a gibbet they died a cruel show.

The priests they crouch o'er their books and scratch away at history
The King he rises from his bed
Leads his men, rides again
But before he sees the border he is dead.

The priests they walk in procession with the coffin of state
The King he leaves his work undone
It is his fate, despite his hate
That his foe lives on to fight his son.",Lanercost

Over many a wild high mountain
And they did say that saw him go

He rode east and he rode west
All in the morning early
Until he spied his lady fair
Cold and wet and weary

Why did you leave your house and land
Why did you leave your baby
Why did you leave your own wedded lord
To go with the Black Jack Davy

What care I for your goose feather bed
With the sheets turned down so bravely
Well I may sleep on the cold hard ground
Along with the Black Jack Davy

Made of the Spanish leather
And I'll put on my lowland brogues
And skip it o'er the heather

Come now unto me,
Could you fancy a poor sailor lad
Who has just come from sea.

You are ragged love, you are dirty love,
And your clothes smell much of tar,
So be gone you saucy sailor lad,
So be gone you Jack Tar.

If I am ragged love and I am dirty love,
And my clothes smell much of tar,
I have silver in my pocket love
And gold in great store.

And then when she heard him say so
On her bended knees she fell,
I will marry my dear Henry
For I love a sailor lad so well.

Do you think that I am foolish love,
Do you think that I am mad,
For to wed with a poor country girl
Where no fortune's to be had?

I will cross the briny ocean,
I will whistle and sing,
And since you have refused the offer love
Some other girl shall wear the ring.

Good tempered and free,
And I don't give a single pin my boys

Steeleye Span,"All things are quite silent, each mortal at rest, 
When me and my true love lay snug in one nest, 
When a bold set of ruffians broke into our cave, 
And they forced my dear jewel to plough the salt wave.

I begged hard for my darling as I would for my life.
But they'd not listen to me although a fond wife, 
Saying: The king must have sailors, to the seas he must go, 
And they left me lamenting in sorrow and woe.

Through green fields and meadows we of times have walked, 
And the fond recollections together have talked, 
Where the lark and the blackbird so sweetly did sing, 
And the lovely thrushes' voices made the valleys to ring.

Now although I'm forsaken, I won't be cast down.
Who knows but my true love some day may return
And will make me amends for my trouble and strife, 
And me and my true love might live happy for life.",All Things Are Quite Silent

Let the hands and feet go cold

To beg for bread and beer
Sometimes we're lame, sometimes we're blind
Sometimes too deaf to hear

In a flock of straw on the ground
Sometimes eat a crust that's rolled in the dust
And are thankful it can be found

That into rags would rend you
And the spirits that stand by the naked man
In the book of moons defend you

Nor travel from yourselves with me
Abroad to beg your bacon

How I spent my days alone 
The busy world was not for me

On the stone an ancient hand 
In a faded yellow-green 
Made alive a worldly wonder

Now and ever bound to labor 
On the sea and in the sky

When there wasn't even any Hollywood

Could be the very same 
A wooly man without a face 
And a beast without a name

Can you see what has been done

The spoor is on the wind tonight
You won't feel it till it grows

[Chorus]
Rose darling my friend
With only you and what I've found
We'll wear the weary hours down

Rose darling come to me
The clock is close at hand
All my empty words of love
Can never screen the flash I feel

Or make you understand
Honey can't you see
I know it's real it's got to be
Why not chase it where it goes

[Chorus]",Rose Darling
Steely Dan,"Lost in the Barrio I walk like an Injun
So Carlo won't suspect something's wrong here
I dance in place
And paint my face
And act like I belong here

[Chorus]
Throw back the little ones
And pan-fry the big ones
Use tact, poise and reason
And gently squeeze them

Hot licks and rhetoric
Don't count much for nothing
Be glad if you can use what you borrow
So I pawn my crown
For a ride uptown
And buy it back tomorrow

[Chorus]

Done like a matador I pray for the weekend
And hope the little girls still throw roses
Else I'll change my bait
And move upstate
Before the season closes

Steely Dan,"Who are these children
Who scheme and run wild
Who speak with their wings
And the way that they smile
What are the secrets
They trace in the sky
And why do you tremble
Each time they ride by

[Chorus]
Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal
Life is unreal

Who are these strangers
Who pass through the door
Who cover your action
And go you one more
If you're feeling lucky
You best not refuse
It's your game the rules
Are your own win or lose

[Chorus]",Your Gold Teeth II
Steely Dan,"In the mornin' you go gunnin' for the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all singin' as they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hangin' and they put you on the street

You go back, Jack, do it again, wheel turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer, and you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one, and she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin' you'll be on your knees tomorrow, yeah

You go back, Jack, do it again, wheel turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

Now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gamblin' man
Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money so you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table

You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again",Do It Again

You don't want to call nobody else

They danced the famous Merengue 
Now we dolly back 
Now we fade to black 

Tearful reunion in the USA 
Day by day those memories fade away

It changed, it grew, and everybody knew

There's no return

One of these surely will screen out the sorrow

Just when it seems so clear 
That it's over now

To bring a body down 
She daily preaches 
On where she wants to be

Can you swallow up your pride
Take your guns off it you're willin'

There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers

You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long

Call me Deacon Blues

A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations
Sensations
That stagger the mind

I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

It's the dance, it's the dress, she's a concept more or less

At century's end
Nobody's holding out for heaven
It's not for creatures here below
We just suit up for a game

It might be careless rapture

This kid's got the eye, call it pirate radar
Scooping out the roof for some trend
But there's nobody new, so she zeros in on you

At century's end
Nobody's holding out for heaven
It's not for creatures here below
We just suit up for a game

By now it's second nature

Scratch the camera, we can grab the locals
Let's get to the love scene, my friend
Which means look, maybe touch but beyond that not too much

I see no tears
I know that you know it may be the last

To be in with the better half
But how many friends must I have
To begin with to make you laugh

Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day

You know that the coming is so close at hand
You feel all right
I guess only women in cages can stand
This kind of night
I guess only women in cages
Can play down
The things they lose
You think no tomorrow will come
When you lay down
You can't refuse

Or played in combination
You throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll

Can't you see it shine behind the glass
Your fortune is your roving eye
Your mouth and legs
Your gift for the runaround
Torture is the main attraction
I don't need that kind of action
You don't have to dance for me

Where the days and nights are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame

That's got to find a place to hide me

Watch the children playing
Perhaps I'll find in my head
What my heart is saying

A kingdom where the sky is burning

To the bottom of a bad town 
Amid the ruins

Their southern sky was clouded by 
A savage winter 
Every patron saint 
Hung on the wall, shared the room 
With twenty sinners

He thinks he's died and gone to heaven

Try to design a postcard from your mind 
Piggy bank ooooo-whee 
If it's Heaven-sent then you'll go far 
Listen well to me 
Smoke that 7 cent cigar 
Can that rumble 
And Avogadro's Number

Snap my jelly roll 
Count your change 
For your midnight chore 
Play that ""sell-your-soul"" exchange

With words that just won't quit

Steely Dan,"I remember Christmas morning 
Back in 1954 
When we moved up to Mount Savage 
As if it mattered anymore 
Mama always said 
How the air can clear her head 

We were colder and much higher 
Than we ever were before 
I recall her tailored jersey 
And the flowers that she wore 
Years ago I tried to tell her 
What was in my heart 
But she was part of the city 

[Chorus]
She took a little with sugar 
She took the money from my old man 
She took a little with sugar 
She took the money from my old man 

All the years that she was with us 
You could count them on one hand 
I was taken with her showboat style 
But too young to understand 
She was all alone 
Ahead of her time 
She was first generation 

[Chorus]",A Little With Sugar
Steely Dan,"Will you walk a little faster?, said a whiting to a snail
There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail
Don't you see how eagerly the turtles and the lobsters all advance
They are waiting on the shingle, won't you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
(3x)
You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters in the sea
But the snail replied ""Too far, too far!"" and gave a look askance
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance
[Chorus]
(2x)
[Ba ba ba ba ba ba etc continuous background to end]
What matters it how far we go? his scaly friend replied
There is another shore, you know, upon the other side
The further off from England the nearer is to France
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance
[Chorus]",Mock Turtle Song
Steely Dan,"The fish are flying in the county sea
The cops are searching for a missing pea
And Billy Burroughs, is he still on the nod?
Be with the girl if I'm not a dandy guy
But be assured that if this shaking world
Is sucked into the sun
More to come
More to come
And when the seventh day at last is gone
More to come
More to come
The ladies sure looked like they're craving for me
But ain't that just what they're supposed to be
I hear the man is moving in next door
The boys will have to use the second floor
You might have answers I can understand
But I know only one
More to come
More to come
And when the seventh day at last is gone
More to come
More to come
The kids have torn a yellow packet apart
Ain't that enough to break a rich mans heart
I see the rats have found the cradle again
I'll let you know if I remember when
There's one conclusion that I must defend
It's where we started from
More to come
More to come
And when the seventh day at last is gone

Steely Dan,"Ten cent store is in my way
Just can't do what the captain say

That stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down

One day I'd stop and click my heels

Cheese in the mouths of babes is fine with me

By morning who knows where I'll be

I was helpless
Like a small child
No eyes of my own
That could take me through the nighttime
No moonlight to guide me
No shadow to hide me

Tried to help me
In a bad way

Strung out and down-hearted

They will be there

Steely Dan,"Hunting in the Sea of Japan,
Ambrose left the tourist trail behind him.
So bold with his gun in his hand,
Of his furs there was no need to remind him.
Tripping over a Holy Man,
Mind that here you don't choose your friends,
Ambrose asked for a helping hand,
He heaved his chest, and pointed West,
To where the river runs.
With Josie back home on his mind,
Brushing off the fruit flies of the season,
And 'Brosie was surely struck blind,
By a sight that defies human reason:
On an island of gleaming rock,
Jutting up from the blue lagoon,
A ceremonial music box
And from it flowed, a bright new mode,
That made our hero swoon.
A finer minor from China.
The World when the traveler returned,
As you know played out its bloody romances.
But Ambrose he knew what he'd learned,
With his prize in hand he took his chances.
Soon the sound that delights the ear,
Blended in with the armies' roar.
When the warriors strained to hear,
This new bebop, this shooting star,
Their guns were bullet-full.
A finer minor from China.
A finer minor from China.
A finer minor from China.",Yellow Peril

As long as you go where I go
I can't complain about the pain and the heartache
The tears when your kisses disguise the lies 
My eyes don't see
And what do I need to know
As long as you go where I go
Wake up in the morning where the bad news can't find me
Walking in the sunshine with you right behind me
'Cause lazy living sure treats me right

Millon things are running trough my brain

There's too many excuses
Instead of what truth is
Fammi dire...

I've heard the world can say a lot
But I know I can stand all deaf in here
My ears ring
And I realize...

Sometimes I'm just trying
To get so far away from here

Trying to find some wisdom
That I hope that I can use

And the light that shines before us
Is looking brighter than the sun

Time is not my enemy my friend
But let it be again...

Every day our last chance
Do that parades and all the world is due

scared of simple conversation
Unaware it's not me that you're fighting
Just hold me...
...so I breathe again!

Believe the sound of thunder 
Is just a never ending kiss

We hold on to forever
So there's nothing I will miss

Try to get it 
Just try like
We've never seen before

Time will be my enemy again
So let it be again

Love is the key 
To be who you are...
To change what you can
And leave the rest of it...

Sometimes I'm just trying
To get so far away from here

Trying to find some wisdom
That I hope that I can use

And the light that shines before us
Is looking brighter than the sun

Time is not my enemy my friend
But let it be again...

Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above

Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far

Stefan Forssén,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

I'd be rich as Rockefeller

Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Stefan Karlsson,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship
Stefan Karlsson,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Stefan Karlsson,"I had a love and my love was fair
Fair as a summer's dawn
I lost my love, I never knew where
Suddenly she was gone
The west wind's purple meadow
The night she slipped away
And I seem to glimpse her shadow 
When the west wind brushes the day

West wind, can you waken my true love
West wind, can you restore a new love
Speak to her softly of the dream we lost
The theme we lost, the gleam we lost

West wind, can you call back an old love
West wind, can you kindle a cold love
West wind, can the magic of them become out once again
Breathe on the amber
If I try to remember
Then some day at last we 
Can recapture the past",West Wind

Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold

Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara my own, think of me now and then
God speed my love till you are mine again

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you

Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best

A wet day, which everyone you choose

When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
Stefan Scaggiari,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Stefan Scaggiari,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In
Stefan Schmid,"Summertime,
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high

Your daddy's rich
And your mamma's good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're going to rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky

But till that morning
There's a'nothing can harm you
With daddy and mamma standing by",Summertime
Stefan Waggershausen,"Do hast vielleicht Nerven zu fragen
Wie es mir geht
Das sieht doch ein Blinder
Daß es blendend um mich steht.
Mein Leben ist nur noch grau
Icgh bin fast schon tot
Was soll ich dir sagen - es geht mir gut.
Ich hab' böse Visionen
Ich schlafe nicht mehr ein
Nur ab und zu bringen meine rosa Freunde mich heim.
Wenn ich daran denk'
Was der andre grad mit dir tut
Soll ich vielleicht sagen - schlafen sie gut ?
Das Bild auf meinem Paß stimmt schon längst nicht mehr
Mein Gesicht ist mir fremd
Die Zeiten sind ewig her.
Ich bin oft betrunken und eigentlich fast schon tot
Was soll ich dir sagen - es geht mir gut.
Ich hab' keinen Job mehr
Die Wohnung
Die ist ein Gedicht
Vor der Tür hängt ein Schild: bitte stören Sie nicht !
Dein Gift wirkt noch immer und macht mich zärtlich kaputt
Was soll ich dir sagen - es geht mir gut.
Ich lebe mein Leben nur noch defensiv
Ich trage 'nen Sticker - ""No Future"" - ganz exclusiv.
Ich seh' alles nur noch grau - bin eigentlich tot.
Was soll ich dir sagen - es geht mir gut.
",Es Geht Mir Gut
