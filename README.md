# paranormal_playlist
This is a recommender system that lets you enter a paranormal romance book and get back a Spotify playlist of hair metal songs as a soundtrack

About:
This was my final project at allWomen Tech DS Bootcamp (5/2021-7/2021). The video presentation can be seen here: https://youtu.be/Ke0LeeY-LK8?t=1367 and the presentations without narration can be seen here: https://sway.office.com/W0qWgUcxXmIMwpbV?ref=Link

Next Steps:
+ Scrape track numbers from Spotify - either use fuzzy match to work with csv I have or scrape track info and combine csv files
+ Create a webapp so people can use this themselves
+ Allow users to sign into their own Spotify account to create their own playlists
+ Set up automatic scraping of books
