The hustlers float
And the young ones dream

As you stare by the neon gods above
While you bask in the heat
And the streets cry freedom
As the blood runs cold
As you stare into the eyes of the walking ghosts
Who've lost their souls
In the summer's heat I'm weary
In the soul of the city
Potential's burning bright
In the Harlem halls
Have you ever lived looking down a shotgun barrel
When they said hey boy, this ain't your home
There ain't no cure for the bleeding heart
'Cause when you fall there's no second start in the city
There'll always be the soul of the city
And the streets cry freedom
As it burns in the heat
You stare by the neon gods above
While you bask in the heat
And the streets cry freedom
As the blood runs cold
You stare into the eyes of the walking ghosts
Who've lost their souls
There is no reason
For livin' in sin
I don't believe when they say hey boy, you better give in
You know I'll fight for what I know
'Til the day that I die
'Cause I'm better off dead
Then buried along with my pride
And the streets cry freedom
'Til the day that I die, yeah

When we're caught in the heat of the fight
Hope it's all gonna turn out right
When we almost say goodbye
That's when we gotta hold on
When we're ready to climb the walls
When we're starting to lose it all
We're both gonna take the fall
That's when we gotta hold on
Love stops the hands of time
In the middle of a dream, we cross the line
Love stops the hands of time
Baby, we can last forever or at least tonight if we try
And like the movies when the ending's right
It's just a battle but it's worth the fight
Love's a prisoner with no compromise, no surrender
But I know when we make love
I never can get enough
When it comes to push and shove
That's when we gotta hold on
We have our ups and downs
Loose pieces on the ground
When hearts beat silent sound
That's when we gotta hold on
Love stops the hands of time
In the middle of a dream, we cross the line
Love stops the hands of time
We can last forever or at least tonight if we try
And did I tell you true magic is a game
You set it up with mirrors to break it down again

And a woman steals an innocent in a crossfire serenade
Sleep can keep this messed-up world shut out
Only so long, what we gonna do?
Swim up a river, the current pulls you down
No rest for the hopeless when the ship starts hittin' ground
The poison is the hustle, the whips about to crack
Get so high to gypsy moon ain't never gonna come back, no, yeah
The sun can rise in the mornin', that's true
But it's one dark afternoon, angel, ooh...
Sentenced to the fire, hear the mission bell
The world is gettin' hotter than hell
Spinnin' in a circle, wishin' in a well
The devil's gettin' smarter
And the world is gettin' hotter than hell
Gettin' hotter than hell
A hero on the TV falls before the crowd
Starve without a reason, cry without a sound
Beverly Hills to Harlem, I wonder, I wonder who's the guide
And the face of ancient stories swims against the tide
Monkey in the middle still laughin' at us all, and we slide
Sentenced to the fire, hear the mission bell
The world is gettin' hotter than hell
Spinnin' in a circle, wishin' in a well
The devil's gettin' smarter
And the world is gettin' hotter
Pray for the sinner and suffer the fool
There's a tale of the dark
Where carnival lights wipe the stars from the sky
And it's your fault and mine
That the pages of time draw the blank
Draw the blank

I can feel you now and then
But I'm kinda losing touch
Something in my mind
Is growing off and on and on again
Stranded in the night
Lonely is the price of love
I would gladly sacrifice
Only for the price of love
I would hang my soul to dry
Maybe for the price of love
And it cuts you like a knife
Stranded in the night
Lonely is the price of love
(Lonely is the price of love)
I would gladly sacrifice
Only for the price of love

I would hang my soul to dry
Maybe for the price of love
And it cuts you like a knife
The price of love

Empty promises that thunder in the night
Something's coming on the wind

So why'd you take so long
My soul is aching, you know I'm not that strong
There was a time I'd live and die for you
Gave you my heart every time
There was a time I'd laugh and cry with you
Only the strong can survive the storm
So tell me how you've been my friend
Do you think of me ever in your life
You gotta lose to learn to win
I never knew it cuts you like a knife
So why'd you take so long
I'd wait forever but forever's far too long

The thrill of the chase is so damn nice
Take me inside
To taste the scent will do just fine
Now I don't wanna have to tell you no lies
The secrets we keep can take us way beyond all heights
Some kinda crazy on the borderline o' sin
Will take you to the shape I'm in
Tie you up
Maybe never let you down
Tie you up
Meet me in the underground
Something in the air tonight
Is driving us insane
Like the fire from a dragon
I'll be breaking at the chains
To tie you up, ooh, tie you up
Lights out on the playground
The carousel starts at the darkened fair
One taste of pleasure now, darling
Where the signs all say just beware
Like a bullet hits you straight between the eyes
Feel your body shaking starting deep within your thighs
You can never match me, bite for bite or gun to gun
I can't stop till I'm done
Tie you up
Maybe never let you down
Tie you up
Meet me in the underground
Something in the air tonight

87,Baton Rouge,Tokyo Time,"We cut a perfect diamond
Out of sync and vague
It bleeds from the heart, it's fallen apart
It's all a big mistake
So many words unspoken
Are lost into the fall
It's headed for dark of powder and spark
The final curtain call
Cut a perfect diamond
And then a perfect lie
You and me, we don't disagree
We're full tilt compromise
It isn't hard to make a blind man see
You're living on Tokyo time
Living on Tokyo time
Once we had the answers
Once we had the key
Then came the rain, the thundering strain
A ghost ship on the sea
I try to understand you
I don't know where it's lost
A haunting inside, a swallowing pride
A fairytale will cost
Once we had the answers
Now we have the lies

Take me inside, 'cause I ain't done yet

A perfect fit like a hand in your glove
Make me electric, baby, set me on fire
Rattle my bones, take me wire to wire
Never knew nothing, baby, quite like this
Till I had a taste of your vampire kiss
In the dark of an alley
In for the kill takes their least
Oh, my will had been taken
Lost in the spell of the beast
Roll me over, midnight lay
Feel your presence though you're miles away
Got to shake it, bound to lose
Balls a-hanging and my head's in your noose
Take me inside, 'cause I ain't done yet
No, I'm not talking 'bout love
Sweat on sweat, baby, sex on sex
Pound for pound, grind to the ground
Make me electric, baby, set me on fire
Rattle my bones, take me wire to wire

Valentines are bleeding, you're not what I need

Lover's leap is waiting, but you can jump alone

93,Bon Jovi,(It's Hard) Letting You Go,"It ain't no fun lying down to sleep
And there ain't no secrets left for me to keep
I wish the stars up in the sky
Would all just call in sick
And the clouds would take the moon out
On some one-way trip
I drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend
But somehow they drove me back here once again
To the place I lost at love - the place I lost my soul
I wish I'd just burned down this place that we called home
It would all have been so easy
If you'd only made me cry
And told me how you're leaving me
To some organ grinder's lullaby

It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart
It's hard letting you go

Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to
Well - me, these days
I just miss you - it's the nights that i go insane
Unless you're coming back for me
That's one thing i know that won't change

Now some tarot card shark said i'll draw you a heart
And we'll find you somebody else new
But I made my last trip to those carnival lips
When I bet all that I had on you
 x2

It's been 4,000 hours
200 days
I curse every minute
Since you ran away
It's hard
Letting you go
It's hard, so hard, it's hard, so hard
It's hard letting you go

Looking for a reason not to leave

If you don’t know if you should stay
If you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just breathe
There’s no where else tonight we should be
You wanna make a memory

I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I don’t wanna ask

If you go now, I’ll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan
You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory

If you don’t know if you should stay
And you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just breathe
There’s no where else tonight we should be-

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

TV and takeout on the coffee table
Paper dishes, pour a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
And for the moment everything is alright
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

Because we can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we
We can, just wrap your arms around me
We can, we can


I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean (I don't wanna be)
I am a rock not just another grain of sand (Oh yeah)
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder

103,Bon Jovi,Bed of Roses,"Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist, I wake up and french kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well, this hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah


Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on...

When all was said and done

Blood on blood
Well, Bobby was our hero
Because he had a fake ID
I got busted stealing cigarettes
And he took the rap for me
Danny knew this white trash girl
We each threw in a ten
She took us to this cheap motel
And turned us into men

Danny, he's a medicine man
And me, I'm just the singer
In a long haired rock and roll band
Through the years and miles between us
It's been a long and lonely ride

I would be right by your side

So you can run as soon as you can""

I been writin' this before I could read
When mama said, ""Son, don't let this hard world
Do what it's doin' to me
Don't let it do what it's done to me""

It's a hard rain that's gonna fall on the city
Still a hard rain that's gonna fall on the farm

There's no seventh day in a world without pity
There's no ball and chain, but the change didn't come
Where's my better days? Where's my Jesus saves?
Where's someone to say
""We gotta hang on""?
We're brothers in arms
Down in southern Alabama
It's ""yes sir"", ""no ma'am"", ""thank you"", and ""please""
But don't you step outta line, don't rewrite or define
What it means to see a man take a knee
Okay, oh, say can you see

It's a hard rain that's gonna fall on the city
Still a hard rain that's gonna fall on the farm

110,Bon Jovi,Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars,"Dressed up for a big date
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face
She was one of a kind
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella
And roller skates in bed
Crash rides the greyhound from his hometown
When he comes around cause they don't let him drive now
Mixed up as a milkshake
But make no mistake
They're shooting for the stars

You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars

Share a toothpick, trading lipstick
Watching traffic for days at the diner
Holding hands, making big plans
Playing Superman, he was wearing eyeliner
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm

They're drunk on love as you can get
Getting high on lust and cigarettes
Living life with no regrets
At least they're gonna try to fly

You and me
We're invincible together
We can be so tragical, whatever
We're Sid and Nancy
Fred and Ginger
Clyde and Bonnie
Liz and Richard
Kurt and Courtney
Bacall and Bogie

Ni ese frío en tus ojos al mirar
No, no vi la realidad

Para aprender hay que caer
Para ganar hay que perder
Lo di todo por ti

Lloré y lloré y juré que no iba a perderte
Traté y traté de negar este amor tantas veces, baby

Si mis lágrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado

Cada hora, una eternidad
Cada amanecer, un comenzar;
Ilusiones nada más
Qué fácil fue soñar
Tantas noches de intimidad
Parecían no acabar
Nos dejamos desafiar
Y hoy nada es igual
Se que en verdad el amor al final siempre duele
No lo pude salvar y hoy voy a pagarlo con creces, baby
Si mis lágrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado

Esta vez la pasión ha ganado
Y por eso sigo esperando
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado

Lloré y lloré y juré que no iba a perderte
Traté y traté de negar este amor tantas veces, baby

We're all a little bit confused
Nothin's the same, this ain't a game
We gotta make it through

As we wave outside the window
Older loved ones stay inside
Moms and babies blowin' kisses
May be saving someone's life
They had to cancel graduation
It ain't fair to Skype the prom
Our kids sit home in isolation

In Central Park last night
Doctors, nurses, truckers, grocery store clerks
Mannin' the front lines
I saw a Red Cross on the Hudson
They turned off the Broadway lights
Another ambulance screams by (Screams by)
There by the grace of God, go I
Although I'll keep my social distance
What this world needs is a hug
Until we find the vaccination
There's no substitute for love
So love yourself and love your family
Love your neighbor and your friend
Ain't it time we loved a stranger?
They're just a friend you ain't met yet
Oh

Water into wine
Some say it's the devil's blood
They're squeezing from the vine
Some say it's a savior
In these hard and desperate times
You see it helps me to forget
That we're just born to die

I came here like so many did
To find a better life
To find my piece of easy street
And finally be alive
I know nothing good comes easy
All good things take some time
I made my bed, I'll lie in it
To die in it's the crime
You can't help but prosper
Where the streets are paved with gold
They say the oil wells ran deeper here
Than anybody's known
Now I packed up on my wife and kid
And left them both back home
See, there's nothing in this pay dirt
The ghosts are all I know
Now the oil's gone
And he money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hanging on

Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one is getting out of here alive
(Not this time)

""In the blessed name of Jesus""
I heard a preacher say
""We are all God's children
And he'd be back, back someday""
I hoped that he knew
Something as he drank that cup of wine
I didn't have too good of a feeling
As I head out to the night
I cursed the sky to open
I begged the clouds for rain
I prayed all night for water
For this burning in my veins (Every night's the same)
It was like my soul's on fire
And I had to watch the flames
All my dreams went up in ashes
And my future blew away

Now the oil's gone
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hanging on

Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash theese sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here alive

A man spends his whole life
Waiting praying for some big reward
But it seems sometimes
That payoff leaves you feeling
Like a dirty whore
If I could choose the way I'd die
Make it by the gun or knife
Because the other way there's too much pain
Night after night after night after night

Oh, down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, now maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not your cry that I hear at night, no
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

118,Bon Jovi,Have a Nice Day,"Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away

Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly

119,Bon Jovi,Hearts Breaking Even,"It's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold night tonight
And I can't get you off of my mind
God knows I've tried
Did I throw away the best part of my life
When I cut you off
Did I cut myself with the same damn knife
Hide my tears in the pouring rain
Had my share of hurt and pain
Don't say my name, run away, cause it's all in vain

My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died
We've both got our reasons
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye
It's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight

It's been a long, long, long, long, long time
Since I've had your love here in my hands
We didn't understand it, we couldn't understand it
But, nothing's fair in love and hate
You lay it all down and walk away, before it's too late
We danced all night as the music played
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made
There in the stains, we remain
No one left to blame

Go on, get on with your life
Yeah and I'll get on with mine
Broken hearts can't call the cops
Yeah - it's the perfect crime
Twisting and turning the night keeps me yearning
I'm burning alive
I'm paying the price again
But I'll see the light again


Go on, get up
Go on, walk out the door
Say you don't care about me anymore
That's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight
I don't love you like
Not like we used to do
Tell me I would hold on to get better than you
You, hah

Let's go

Hey God, I'm just a little man, I got a wife and family
I almost lost the house, I bought into the dream
We're barely holding on when I'm in way too deep
We're two paychecks away from living out on the streets
She's a working single mom, like a saint she don't complain
She never says a word, but she thinks that she's to blame
Her son just got convicted, he blew some cop away
She did her best to raise him, but the world got in the way

Hey God
Tell me what the hell is going on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on getting harder hanging on
But hey hey hey hey God
There's nights you know I want to scream
These days you're even harder to believe
I know how busy you must be
But hey hey hey hey God
Do you ever think about me?
Born into the ghetto in 1991
Just a happy child playing beneath the summer sun
A vacant lots' his playground, by 12 he's got a gun
The odds are bet against him, junior don't make 21

Hey God
Tell me what the hell is going on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on getting harder hanging on
But hey hey hey hey God
There's nights you know I want to scream
These days you're even harder to believe
I know how busy you must be
But hey hey hey hey God
Do you ever think about me?


I get down on my knees
I'm going to try this thing your way
I've seen a dying man too proud to beg
Spit on his own grave
Was he too gone to save?
Did you even know his name?
Are you the one to blame?
Hah, I got something to say
Hey God
Tell me what the hell is going on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on getting harder hanging on
But hey hey hey hey God
There's nights you know I want to scream
These days you're even harder to believe
I know how busy you must be
But hey hey hey hey God
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about me?
Oh hey God, hey God, think about me?
Do you ever think about me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey God, hey God, hey God, think about me?

121,Bon Jovi,I Want You,"The last time that I saw her
Was the night she said goodbye
She said that love's a stranger
And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did
As she packed up her belongings
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye
But I could see a tear roll
Off her face
As we both tried so hard
Not to cry she said

I never wanted the stars
I never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I tried so hard to remember
Where when how why love went away
I tried to drown myself in pity
But your memory kept calling your name, yes it did
I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings
All the things that my money brings
And the servants to paint the skies blue
And I worked so hard seven days a week
Built a fortress for your heart to keep
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you
I never wanted the stars
I never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Because I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I may have built for you a dream house
But never thought you were alone
I filled the party up with company
But never made our house a home
All I got is my guitar these chords and the truth
All I got is my guitar, but all I want is youEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

See how it takes the turns, see if it breaks or bends

But I will drive you home
I want you to know that
I will drive you home

Hell, it ain't nothing new, everything new gets old

Throwing down, down, down
Down, down

Did you really live your life
Or did it pass you by?
What's it take to tell yourself
You really were alive
Look me in the eye
Here comes the knockout
My time is right now
Turning your lights out
I'm throwing down
Here comes the knockout

I'm throwing down
Go start a fire, go start a fight
No regrets, this is your life (Hey!)

Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love

Only fools count treasure in silver and gold
I don't want for nothing that these hands can't hold
If you need something done, put it on the list
And if I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips
If I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips

I know every curve, but it's never the same
If love is a fire, I'd go down in those flames
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name

There's been shelter from the storm
A place to run for cover
'Til the rain clouds had moved on
Now when I get that feelin'
Before the first drop hits the ground
I'm askin', ""Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin' down?""

Wherever there's a soldier
Who won't give up the fight
Wherever there's a darkness
That's tryin' to find the light
Wherever there is hurtin'
There's healing on the way
Like sunshine breakin' through a cloudy day

Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin' down?

Maybe someday, eyes won't judge you
By the bed you're sleepin' in
The God you wanna pray to
Or the color of your skin
When priests and politicians
Tell the truth and nothin' more
That day, we'll know what all of this was for
Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin' down?

These ain't pretty pictures that we're keepin in the cloud
Outside, a storm is raging
Just take a look around

Somewhere, there's forgiveness
For the broken ones like me
Who once stared down mighty mountains
And now sit beneath the trees
And somewhere, there's a church bell
That's summoning the choir
Somewhere, there's a dreamer
Who would walk a thousand miles
Somewhere, there's a dreamer
Who would walk a thousand miles

Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin'?

I could ask about our lives
But I only need one answer

I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in
I say we're living on love they say we're living in sin

Is it right for both our parents
Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights
Or wear that ring of diamonds
When your heart is made of stone
You can talk but still say nothing
You stay together but alone
Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight
They say the promise is forever
If you sign it on the dotted line
So baby, can you tell me just where we fit in
I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in

'Til I can waltz on a moonbeam
'Til I can find a way to turn all tears into wine
I'll hitch my ride to a day dream
Can't unkiss the lips that love is leaving behind

I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hate has done to hope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't living with the ghost
How can I scream?
I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word, you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't living with the ghost

I set my sail over wheat fields
Rode waves of amber, let a new sun shine on my face
I dropped the sword, put down my shield
I left your scars for the stars guiding my way
I traded hurting for healing
I must admit that I was reeling
Now I'm feeling just fine
Traded nightmares for dreaming
Go tell your shadows that I got out alive
I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hurt has done to hope
I found the tree, I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't living with the ghost
How can I scream?
I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word, you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't living with the ghost

Last night I had this dream
I saw a man wash his feet
In the church holy water
He worked up to his knees
From his arms to his neck
Said, ""I'm in over my head""
He was crying trying to get some relief
Lord, I'm just trying to get some relief
I had this dream
That man was me

I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hurt has done to hope
I found the tree I cut the rope

We slither on in and shed our skin
Make our way into the bump and the grind
So I'm passing by, she gives me the eye
So I stop to give her a light
Na, na, na, na, na-na na-na-na, na-na-na ALRIGHT!

One wild night (blinded by the moonlight)
One wild night (24 hours of midnight)
One wild night (I stepped into the Twilight Zone
And she left my heart with vertigo)
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night

Having as much fun as you can in your clothes
Margarita had me feeling alright
It just might be that I found religion
I've been on my knees for half of the night
Then I'm rolling the bones with Jimmy 'no dice'
Gonna take him for a couple weeks' pay
Man, if you lose this roll I take your girlfriend home
So I stopped
(Spoken): But you're not going to believe who comes walking out
One wild night (blinded by the moonlight)
One wild night (24 hours of midnight)
One wild night (I stepped into the Twilight Zone
And she left my heart with vertigo)
One wild night (hey, c'est la vie)
One wild night (welcome to the party)
One wild night (life is for the living so
You gotta live it up, come on let's go)
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night
Na, na, na, na, na-na na-na-na
Na, na, na, na, na-na na-na-na

150,Bon Jovi,Only Lonely,"Another long and sleepless night
You need someone to hold you tight
Sometimes love don't know wrong from right
Another long and senseless
Fight was all you knew they're all the same
There's no one left to take the blame
What's behind this masquerade
How do we win these losing
Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds we know they run so deep
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you

Only lonely, I can't stop hurting you
Only lonely, but I can't stop loving you
Only lonely, how much pain does it take?

It's getting sometimes I don't know
When to stop when to go
Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show
A stolen kiss so out of place
It wipes the smile right off your face
And when those feelings start
We let them go, let them go
Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds that run so deep
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you
Only lonely, I can't stop hurting you
Only lonely, but I can't stop loving you
Only lonely, so tell me babe, how much pain
Can you take before your heart breaks?

I got this time bomb ticking in my head
This time I think she's gonna blow
How can I say get away
When I just can't let go
Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds that run so
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you

Only lonely, I can't stop hurting you
Only lonely, but I can't stop loving you

152,Bon Jovi,Real Love,"They're putting up the chairs to close, she let me settle up my tab
I told her button up, it's cold, I ain't too drunk to hail us a cab
We can get a cup of coffee but unless you gotta get back home

Sitting across that table, a gypsy couldn't read her mind
I took her hand and told her I just wanna crawl into her eyes
She shook her head and said, “It's cruel”; cruel is just a cheap disguise

Have you ever known a real love
The kind of love that makes you feel love
No, this ain't let's make a deal, love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you would die for
Feels like you're falling through the stars
If it could break your heart
It's real love

We drank that muddy pot of coffee, it was morning when I walked her home
I've never been this lonely, lying in this bed alone
Her words still ringing in my head, her sad eyes sunk me like a stone
Have you ever known a real love?
The kind of love that makes you feel, love?
No, this ain't let's make a deal, love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty 'cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you would die for
Feels like you're falling through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love

I put on that same shirt, and I ran out the door
Stole a fistful of roses from the sidewalk store
With just my heart in my hand, I had nothing to prove
Standing up on her front steps calling to her window

Have you ever known a real love?
The kind of love that makes you feel, love?
No, this ain't let's make a deal, love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty 'cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you will die for
Feels like you're falling through the stars
If it can break your heart

It's just a fork along the road
Don't say your prayers, save your amens
You've come this far, but you're still far from home
Don't say goodbye, just say farewell
Write every line you'll live to tell
Hold your head high, like Harry, give 'em hell
As the night ignites the day
Make some memories along the way, hey

Write your song, sing along, love your life
Learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
Start your revolution, and I'll see you at the reunion

Some friends will go and some will stay
Okay, some last a chapter, some a page
For some love comes disguised as lust
But you'll find love when you find trust one day
Do better than our parents did
Imperfect husband, wife, and kids
Go chart your course then turn it upside down
Go live your life, eyes open wide
Who's to say what's wrong or right, right?
Write your song, sing along, love your life
Learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
Start your revolution, and I'll see you at the reunion, oh

Go make some memories along the way

Wish I could read your mind
Move up or out of line
Too late for praying
I know we might lose our breath
We might be scared to death
This chance is like a step
Just gotta take it
Oh, countdown to here we go

Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time flies by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss, love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry-go-round

It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster
Can't lie and won't pretend
I know what's 'round the bend
Too late to start again
Won't take it slower
Let's slip right off these tracks
We'll fly or we might crash
Don't look down, don't look back
'Cause it ain't over

Hold on tight, slide a little closer

They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes

But you was living in another world trying to get your message through

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find

Never felt nothing, jumping right into deep end
I wasn't missin' nothin' that was ever worth getting
Never hung around enough to regret it
You walking in late but just in time
You ended my excuses with a ten-cent rhyme
Your shoes and attitude were stacked way up high
I knew right then you were the story of my life, oh

Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings
Opened my eyes now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets I took that step and I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings, yeah

When you're driving down a street that's only going one way
When every day starts feeling like a month of Mondays
You should know I still got something left to prove
I know what it takes to get back to you, oh
Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings
Opened my eyes now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets I took that step and I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings, yeah

Remember those nights staring out at the lights
Making time with our feet in the sand
Making up words to our favorite songs
Laughin' loud with those drinks in our hands
And as that boy put his head on her shoulder
She pulled him tight to get a bit closer
And as the world just disappeared
You whispered in my ear

Oh, those saturday nights gave me Sunday morning
Opened my eyes now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through

Tell me it's a nightmare
Please wake me up
Say it isn't so
I found a book of matches
Some place we've never been
How come you hang the phone up
The minute I walk in
Last night I had this dream
That I was losing you
I woke up in a cold sweat shaking
Rescue me my heart is breaking

Say it isn't so

Tell me it's a lie

Say everything's alright

Dancing on the beach in a bad B-movie

A little drunk and worn out from the show
It's a hallway to a hotel room
The truck's already rolling down the road
I find the lights, take off my coat
I see her there just lying on the bed
She's seen me through my yesterdays
God knows tonight I'm needing her again

She's the place I go when there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold when there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
She heard my every word when I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack and scratch and scar on this guitar

She's given me her best when I am at my worst
When I can't find the pieces
Fingers scratching in the dirt
And she offers no forgiveness 'cause she likes to make it hurt

She's the place I go when there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold when there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
And she heard my every word when I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack and scratch and scar on this guitar
Morning like a freight train
Last night still ringing in my head
Before today becomes tomorrow
Tonight I know I'll do it all again

She's the place I go when there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold when there's no one to hold on to
And she's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
And she heard my every word when I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack and scratch and scar on this guitar

A box for your dreams
A book for your heart
Take the stick and stone
And we'll make a spark

Been waiting for a miracle

My suitcase and guitar are my only family
I've tried to need someone, like they needed me
Well I opened up my heart, but all i did was bleed
I don't need no lover, just to get screwed
They don't make a bandage, that's going to cover my bruise

Come on, come on, come on

Pull me under (help i'm falling)
Through my veins
To a place
Where i feel no pain
Be the pillow under my head (night is calling)
Cover me when i'm in your bed
Take me higher than i've ever been(feels like i'm flying)
Take me down and back again
Come to me, be my disguise (christ i'm dying)
Open your coat, let me crawl inside
Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when

You sell yourself on hopes and dreams
That leaves you feeling sideways
Tripping over my own feet
Trying to walk to my own beat
Another car out on the street trying to find the Highway
Yeah, Are you going my way?

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white
And it's anything but grey
I know that no I'm not alright, but I feel ok cos
Anything can, everything can happen
That's the story of my life

I gonna write the melody
That's gonna make history
And when I paint my masterpiece I swear I'll show you first
There just ain't a way to see who and why or what will be
Till now is then
It's a mystery, it's a blessing and a curse
Or something worse

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
And I hope you're by my side when I'm writing the last page

168,Bon Jovi,Story of Love,"Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive, 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love

They can offer advice that you don't wanna hear
Words that cut like a knife and still ring in your ear
You think of them ignorant, they think of you arrogant
If you need evidence, who gave you confidence?

A snap of the finger and you're not a child
But you're still holdin' on as you walk down the aisle
When they give you away to hear someone else say
That someone will love you 'til their dyin' day

Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love
And that's the story of love

You can choose to remember or choose to forget
If they took you to school or they tucked you in bed
You can say it don't matter, you won't do the same
You'd think no one noticed when you looked away
Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love

Now they're getting older, and you ain't so young
So you take care of them like your daughters and sons
You can ask for forgiveness, they could ask for the same
Forget all the anguish, the heartache, the pain

Wherever you go or wherever you've been
It's them that is with you, and that's you that's with them
Fathers and daughters and mothers and sons
As one story ends, another's begun

Oh, fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love
From hello to goodbye, that's the story of love
That's the story of loveEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

I want to say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me

Lock the doors

Are these five words tonight

Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me 

I never knew I had a dream
Until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes
The sky's a different blue
Cross my heart
I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe
That you believed my lies

You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me

Yeah 
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words tonight

She came looking for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Trying to learn to fly
From a second story window
He just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy
He said, ""Momma, i've got to try
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
And I guess I'd rather die than f-f-fade away"", yeah

Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving

The picture window's cracked, and there's nowhere to run

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

Drove a spike into the ground and I staked my claim
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Standing on the dirt where they'll dig my grave
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Now what built these walls is in my veins
No time for lookin' back, the wolf is at the door
This heart, this soul, this house is not for sale
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

This house was built on trust
That's what it is, and always was
No wrecking ball could knock it down
This house was built on higher ground

In a world, they forgot
Lives the heart of me
A part that just won't die
Just a boy, not a man
Sent to war, in a land
They said we'd fight for their freedom
But I felt like a hired hand
Sometimes I have to find my way
Sometimes I have to get away
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Working hard, for a pass
Got the night, make it last
It was a time to remember
All my life I would never forget
In a bar, breathing smoke
Snorting whiskey, drinking coke
It was a time when no one would die
And there wasn't a care
Sometimes I wish it was that way
Cause sometimes I have to get away
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
This guy turns me around and he's pointing up the stairs
I found myself in her doorway but there wasn't anybody there
She walked in the room with nothing on but a red light
And with a smile she got so close to me
She whispered something 'bout midnight
You know I didn't understand a word she said
But it felt so good
She knew that I didn't have any money
But baby I knew she would...

I could take a hit but I don't want to take the fall

And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old shit going around
I'm going down, down ,down, down, down
In a two story town

There's a girl that I sleep with
She's got ecstasy eyes
He promised her roses and American pie
I called her and my demons
And I kissed them both goodbye
Seven days of Monday morning
In a two story town

One shot to make a move now
The ghosts are calling me out
And me I'm just one story
In a two story town
But you're never going to find me in the lost and found


It's just the same old sights and the same old sounds
I want to take my horse and drive out of this merry-go-round
I won't give in and I won't back down

They sent us to a place
I never heard of weeks before
When you're nineteen it ain't hard to sleep
In the desert on God's floor
Close your eyes, stop counting sheep
You ain't in boot camp anymore

We were taught to shoot our rifles
Men and women side by side
Thought we'd be met as liberators
In a thousand-year-old fight
I got this painful ringing in my ear
From an IED last night
But no lead-lined Humvee war machine
Could save my sergeant's life
Three more soldiers, six civilians
Need these words to come out right

God of mercy, God of light
Save your children from this life
Hear these words, this humble plea
For I, have seen the suffering
And with this prayer, I'm hopin'
That we can be unbroken
It's eighteen months now, I’ve been stateside
With this medal on my chest
But there are things I can't remember
And there are things I won't forget
I lie awake at night
With dreams the Devil shouldn't see
I wanna scream, but I can't breathe
And Christ, I'm sweatin' through these sheets
Where's my brothers? Where's my country?
Where's my ""how things used to be""?

God of mercy, God of light
Save your children from this life
Hear these words, this humble plea
For I, have seen the suffering
And with this prayer, I'm hopin'
That we can be unbroken

My service dog's done more for me
Than the medication would
There ain't no angel that's comin' to save me
But even if they could
Today, twenty-two will die from suicide
Just like yesterday, they're gone
I live my life for each tomorrow
So their memories will live on
Once we were boys, and we were strangers
Now we're brothers and we're men
Someday, you'll ask me, ""Was it worth it
To be of service in the end?""
Well, the blessing and the curses
Yeah, I'd do it all again

If you ain't got someone, you're afraid to lose
Everybody needs just one, someone
To tell them the truth
Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I still believe
I believe in hope, I believe the change can get us off our knees

What do you got if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough
You're walking the road, but you're going nowhere
You're trying to find your way home, but there's no one there
Who do you hold in the dark of night?
You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight
You have all the things that you've been dreaming of
If you ain't got love, it's all just keeping score
If you ain't got love, what the hell we doing it for

I don't wanna have to talk about it
How many songs you gotta sing about it?
How long you gonna live without it?
Why does someone somewhere have to doubt it?
Someday you'll figure it out


What do you got if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough
You're walking the road, but you're going nowhere
You're trying to find your way home, but there's no one there
Who do you hold in the dark of night?
You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight
You have all the things that you've been dreaming of
What do you got if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough

183,Bon Jovi,When We Were Us,"We were young, unafraid
We were finding our own way
There's no wind, there's no rain
In the eye of a hurricane
Every time you climb that mountain
There's another one left to climb
Don't go looking for tomorrow
Leaving yesterday behind

Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us

We were one, born and raised
More than blood runs through these veins
Cuts can heal, scars will fade
What we had will never change
Seasons pass and time will move on
You don't ever have to let it go
You can only go so far now
Till you're on your way back home
Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us

Memories are nothing more than ghosts that we let in
Don't be afraid of them, do you remember when

Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust

184,Bon Jovi,Who Says You Can't Go Home?,"I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

I been there, done that and I ain't looking back
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?

There's only one place left I want to go
Who says you can't go home?

Somebody to be there night and day
Someone to kiss your fears away

Too weak, too proud, too tough to say
I couldn't be the one
To make your dreams come true
That's why I had to run
Though I needed you, baby

Your feet don't touch the ground

They say, ""(Oh yeah)
We were cruisin' to the backbeat
(Oh yeah) Makin' love in the backseat

And ooh, we were wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets""

A member of the boy's brigade
Had a date with the girl next door
You know it made her daddy crazy
It only made her want him more
But they weren't looking for trouble
You know that boy didn't want a fight, not tonight
So she headed out through her bathroom window
What her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright
She said, ""(Oh yeah)

But you know it ain't so bad
Just like a girl who looks so happy
When inside she's so so sad

No one's goin' down
You don't walk in vain
Through the kid's parade

And nothing else can get you through the night

A broken man who looked like me
And no one knows the pain that he's been livin'
He lost his love and still hasn't forgiven

I won't be afraid no more

Once you feel you got a part
You gotta go
You gotta go
Did you ever see a smile?
Kicks it off
And it takes you home
Lookin' back on all the pain
I put you through

A bad seed born to lose forever
My Daddy used to teach me with the backside of his hand
Oh Lord, I guess he didn't know better
Leaving was a long long time coming
I don't know now where the courage was found
Cause they said ""Boy, you'll never amount to nothin'""
But oh Lord
I stared my demons down
I had one hand on the bible another hand on the wheel
And I headed out in search of my horizons
There's just one thing that I know for certain
Growing old don't make a boy a man
When my time comes and they raise the final curtains
I'll know I took a stand
I stared my demons
I stared my demons down
Black smoke'll fill up the sky
As my bridges burn to the ground
I'll hold my head up high
As I walk right through this town
Don't need no simple minds
Telling me who I am
So I came back to say goodbye
Look 'em in the eyes
And stare my demons down
In the town that I was born in they said that I was wild

The United States and our allies...
...have prevailed""
In the city, in the dead of the night
The king sits on his throne
And he moves around the pieces
And he makes the facts his own
In the desert, a million miles away
A boy looks to the sky
And he sees the night exploding
And the tears come to his eyes
And he wonders:
What do they want?
What do they want?
It's a desert rain
A cavalcade of flames
Fired in the name
Of the sacred and profane
And we're all to blame
And nothing will remain
Unless we rise up
To stop this desert rain
Desert rain
To the fat cats behind the wheel
Nothing is taboo
As they thirst for domination
And they hunger for the crude
In the desert, in the dead of the night
The boy, he prays alone
And he wants to be a hero
So he's strapping on a bomb
And we wonder:
What do they want?
What do they, what do they want?
It's a desert rain
A cavalcade of flames
Fired in the name
Of the sacred and profane
And we're all to blame
And nothing will remain
Unless we rise up
To stop this desert rain
Desert rain
Oh, and we wonder:
What do they want?
What do they, what do they want?
It's a desert rain
A cavalcade of flames
Fired in the name
Of the sacred and profane
And we're all to blame
And nothing will remain
Unless we rise up
To stop this desert rain
This desert rain, this desert rain
This desert rain, this desert rain

He would always check his scope
Before he'd load his magazine

He never knew he'd ever be
A hero at nineteen
It's time to go (inside he knows)
He's on his own (so all alone)
No compromise (none in his eyes)
No questions why, never say die
On the field of shattered dreams
They rise to pull themselves together
In this land of liberty
They wear their Purple Hearts forever
He wet his face to wash the fear away
He said a prayer behind the barricade
He looked out on the desert
As they rolled on down the road
There wasn't any warning or retreat
When twenty-seven vanished in the heat
They never knew that they were going down
Not going home
No compromise (none in his eyes)
No questions why, never say die
On the field of shattered dreams
They rise to pull themselves together

We were much thicker than thieves
But I was a fool to believe
And to show him my secrets and plans
He promised riches above and beyond
Showed me the ropes and just strung me along
Taught me the game, but played me like a pawn
And he'd take all my trust and just grind it to dust
And now, they say, walk away, boy
But the bigger they come, the harder they fall
I pray for the days, boy
When the bigger they come, the harder they fall
Now that the fight's in my hands
I'm wielding the laws of the land
And I pray that justice prevails
But we know that justice is blind
And fate can sometimes be unkind
And there is no option to fail
So I have prepared and if worst comes to worst
I'll make my own laws till he's riding a hearse
Nothing less will ever quench my thirst
For some sweet revenge, I would fight to the and
Oh, but, they say, walk away, boy
But the bigger they come, the harder they fall
I pray for the days, boy
When the bigger they come, the harder they fall
He promised riches above and beyond
Showed me the ropes and just strung me along
Taught me the game, but played me like a pawn
And he'd take all my trust and just grind it to dust
And now, they say, walk away, boy
But the bigger they come, the harder they fall
I pray for the days, boy
When the bigger they come, the harder they fall

347,House of Lords,The Dream,"Oh-oh... oh-whoa... yeah
There's something in the air, there's a darkness everywhere
As the twilight colors fall behind the purple mountain's majesty
From the shadows appeared a king, a fallen angel without his wings
As I gazed upon his face, I saw the souls of lost humanity
Was I dreaming or was the fear just taking hold
Someone wake me, before he steals my soul
I'm running like hell
From the dream all around me
I'm under his spell
In the dream where he found me
Wake up
Wake up
We kill what we can't feed and we steal what we don't need
It's a zombie's life with truth disguised so easily
From the silence of the lambs, walks the tyrant of solitaire
His heart so black, he lays a trap with such diamonds and despair
Was I dreaming or was the fear just taking hold
Someone wake me, before he steals my soul
I'm running like hell
From the dream all around me
I'm under his spell
In the dream where he found me
The toll of the bell
Is the sound of him counting
The dream is of hell
And the kingdom of doubting
Oh... whoa...

Drifting in a haze I see
The light on your face
The sun is rising, rising still
With no hue of the afternoon
The wind whispers on my face
You're the only one
Do you know who I am
Ask yourself
And tell me what you know about me
Don't be afraid to look at me and see
The man who I am
Underneath the silent sky I wait
In this fortress from the sun
My fate follows close to me
It wants for me to know
The spirit flowing in my mind
Is alive with your glow
The quiet sounds of loneliness
Without you, I'd be lost
Do you know who I am
Ask yourself
And then tell me, tell me who I am
Do you know what I'm feeling
Tell me, do you know who I am
I'm the man in love with you
Is that good enough
'Cause I believe in you and me
'Cause that is the man who I am
And I cannot hide
And I'm not afraid to show it
Do you know who I am
Ask yourself
And tell me what you know about me now
Don't be afraid to look at me and see
Finding out the truth, this is my release
To scream out to the world

Over mountains of red
Through the eye of the needle
Runs the one common thread
So wide the picture
In heaven on earth
And somewhere between us
We struggle for worth
From morning till dawn
From here to eternity
An open door
Under blue skies
We are one and the same
Under blue skies
We become one another
We fly into nowhere
Wings to the wind
No chosen direction

We were always on the run
It would seem if you had a dream
Then you could be anyone
I remember one day an old man passed my way
He looked at me and he said

Boy, you look straight ahead""
If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man let you forget it
If you know what you need
You won't regret it
Dream on, that's what I say
You dream on 'til love comes your way
You dream on
And as time went by, as a man I
Would love and I would hide
Love to me was so easy, so free
With no concern and no burning inside
And then one of those nights in the city lights
As the boys and me, we ran wild
She looked at me and his words I could see
As plain as when I was a child
If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man let you forget it
If you know what you need
You won't regret it
Dream on, that's what I say
You dream on 'til love comes your way
You dream on, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, yeah

You better dream on
Oh, you dream on
So if you love and you lose and you pay life's dues
And at times life don't work out
Don't you cry, Jack, and don't you look back
You let these words ring out
If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man let you forget it
If you know what you need
You won't regret it

Together our love is hot
We set each other on fire
And it's only for the moment

It's either up or down
And you never wanna listen to what I gotta say

I knew that it would take
So much more than I could give
I hope we can be friends

Out of luck
Dear old memories thought were lost
Here to haunt me what's the cost?
I need my friends
Take me back
Feel the ocean for a while
I can't live where I can't smile
Lead and change my mind
Tonight
All mine?
Should I believe?
I've got time
Until it goes
Where it all will go
Where apparitions and sight has changed
It was safe out on the sea
All I've got
Lead me there or not
One more miracle
Close the many miles between them and I
Tried to love again
It's been denied
I'd give all I've got just to have one more night of peace
Not alone
Without my woman my mind is aching
Angelic apparitions illuminating
Into your room

Safe from harm

Passed in the pub and I didn't know why
Made a sharp turn and I hooked a b-line

After twice his normal dose
He thought he'd go make the most
In mid-stride of a vague adventure
Hangin' from a stranger's
Tenth floor balcony
It wasn't me;
It must have been
My evil... my evil twin
It wasn't me;
It must have been
My evil twin... my evil...
Push came to shove, and the stranger decided she could fly

467,Stryper,After Forever,"Have you ever thought about your soul
Can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you are dead
You just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head
Or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in the book
When you were at school?

When you think about death, do you lose your breath
Or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope?
Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth, yes, I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared
At the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realise before they criticise
That God is the only way to love
Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well worship the sun?

I think it was true it was people like you
That crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
Was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near
Say you don't believe?
You had the chance, but you turned it down
Now you can't retrieve


Perhaps you'll think before you say
That God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realise
That he's the one
The only one who can save you now
From all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes! I think it's too lateEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

He's the rock that makes us roll
Turn it up, we want you to hear

Can't! Stop! The! Rock!

481,Stryper,Carry On Wayward Son,"Carry on my wayward son*
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed around like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more, No!
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry
Don't you cry no more!
No more!EmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

Tryin' to make your life appealing
You've got no regard
You don't know what the hell you're feeling

You've got everything, live like a king
But how will you live tomorrow?

You're caught in the middle
And you don't know where to go
Turn it around, come back to the ground
Before you break and lose control

Are you here at all
Or are you at the point of no return
You've got to make a call
You've got to make a choice before you get burned

You've got what it takes, make no mistakes
Don't live your life in sorrow
You're caught in the middle
And you don't know where to go
Turn it around, come back to the ground
Before you break and lose control


You've got everything, live like a king
How will you live tomorrow?

Many concerns
Simple frustrations
Respect is what we yearn
We are offended
Easily on cue
Often unfriended
Without a single clue

If we could step back
To see what matters
We would call off the attack
Break the hate
And watch it shatter

Do unto others as you would
Have them do unto you
Often it's a thought misunderstood
But one we must pursue

This life is too short
To waste a day
And worry about
The games we often play
Look to the future
It’s shining bright
It’s really not hard
To choose what we know is right
It’s simple choices
We make alone
If we would think of each other
Maybe we would heal
Not suffer

Do unto others as you would
Have them do unto you
Often it's a thought misunderstood
But one we must pursue

Piety can leave you to bleed

Except the one that's on The Door
That leads us to eternity

Instructions are laid out for us
Addressing every plea
Everything that's right and just

To carry you when you just can't go on

Once upon a lonely night
Emptiness filled my heart
And I realized my life wasn't right Then I called upon your name
And I just want to say
Chorus
I was lonely, lost without your love
Sad and lonely without you
Your the only one that I'll ever love
I need you
Verse 2
All I'll ever need is you
Cause you are everything
I've never seen a love that's so true
The search is over now for me and forever more
And I'll never have to be lonely anymore

511,Stryper,Lost,"Watch the news
And read the stories
It's a nightmare
Run for cover
Search for glory
Is it really anywhere
Darkness in the air
The light is the extinguisher
With a solid fight
Maybe we'll figure out
Just who we were

Are we Lost?
Are we Lost?
At what cost?
Are we Lost?

No matter what we face
Our hope, it will defend us
Don't ever think that we
Can't find another treasure in the dust
And even when we have
Nothing left to turn to
With stronger faith
We'll see the answer
And the lie becomes the truth

Are we Lost?
Are we Lost?
At what cost?
Are we Lost?


Are we Lost?
Are we Lost?
At what cost?
Are we Lost?

You tell me are we lost
You tell me are we lost

I could have everything even what's behind the stars

I broke the mold and tossed the clay, incomprehensible
I’m the only - A rarity

As hearts degrade, can I find some sympathy?
As mercy fades, I am blind but I just I want to see
Set in stone and sealed, I seem unbreakable
In despair, a simple prayer makes change obtainable
I’m forgiven - I forgive

As hearts degrade, can I find some sympathy?
As mercy fades, I am blind but I just I want to see

543,Stryper,Take It to the Cross,"We try to carry the weight of the world
We could just lay it all down
After we've buried the hatchet within
As we sink to drown

Make the mistake and we'll do it again
And maybe not ever to learn
One day we'll wake and the night will be seen
And we will discern it all

Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross

The flesh is so weak, but the spirit is strong
Faith could move mountains away
Why do we seek everything that is wrong
And become the prey?

We were created, yet that is debated
But Christ said it so perfectly:
""I am the way and the truth and the life and you get to
The Father through me!"" ""Through me!""
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross

I’ve seen enough to write tale after tale
But through it all, you never fail

Te Amo – Living, dying, young and old
Te Amo - You’re a treasure with a heart of gold
You were there when I could sense no other soul
And you cared when I was down and letting go
You’re an angel that came down to earth to be
The saving grace to help this non believer see
There is more, so much more
Hidden deep beneath this land of stone

Lives in a bottle just to survive
Had a home and had a wife
That's a story from a different life
We've all seen him a time or two
He's not all that different from me and you
He's more than a face or a name
He's a reason why You came

When were You all alone

Mine too, then you ripped it wide open
Called up your two girlfriends
Told them hurry up and get your ass over here now
Said it won't be long I'm kinda wishin' for death
'Cause you had no intentions of leaving
Without taking everything
First time in years you didn't lie to me
You took my pride, my dreams, my hope
Even my heart and you knew it was broke
Every single ounce of integrity
You took all of me, all of me
Turned my pockets inside out
Making sure that without a doubt
You had absolutely everything
You took all of me, all of me
Watching as you're leaving
Thinking that was so unbelieving
Now I can start breathing
But looks can be deceiving
She is so cold-hearted
Sending me a letter regarding
The last time we parted
Said she was only getting started
I can't believe she still wants something from me
When she left me here with nothing at all
How about her paying me
For my pain and suffering
You took my pride, my dreams, my hope
Even my heart and you knew it was broke

You took all of me, all of me
Turned my pockets inside out
Making sure that without a doubt
You had absolutely everything
You took all of me, all of me

Good thing you're a good liar
You stole enough of my money to retire
I can't believe she still wants something from me

Some call it fate, others reality

It's my life to live my way, so I'll keep daydreaming away
And who knows, maybe someday, it will all come true
And I will get my way, and we will live as one
I'm caught up in a dream, I'm gonna wish for it all
No one's gonna tell me how, no way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing, no way, it's my dream
And what cannot will be done, for every living thing under the sun
Forget color, forget race, and just be one big happy face
Among this sea of people, live among God's creatures, sharing love
That was sent down from above, here to share with one another
Father, brother, sister, mother, everybody sharing love, sharing love
I'm caught up in a dream, I'm gonna wish for it all
No one's gonna tell me how, no way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing, no way, it's my dream, this is my dream
What if...I close my eyes and everything will be alright
Here in my fantasy, living in harmony
Make my dream come alive
I'm caught up in a dream, I'm gonna wish for it all
No one's gonna tell me how, no way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing, no way, it's my dream
I'm caught up in a dream, I'm gonna wish for it all
No one's gonna tell me how, no way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing, no way, it's my dream
Now, if you can imagine this, the whole world sharing one big kiss
Take away the pain and hurt, make like heaven here on earth
Without reason to die, and given everlasting life for allEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

She said we’re all right, and it’s the world that’s wrong
So now I’m thinking I want to put it in a song
I wrote down the words so everyone can sing along

Sourcing out the situation
Smokin’ weed for medication
Hippies rollin on vacation
Catch you on the flip side
Mandatory mediation
Overpayin’, high inflation
Homeschoolin’ education
Catch you on the flip side

Flip side, catch you on the flip side
Flip side, catch you on the flip side

You say I'm crazy cuz’ I ain’t afraid to fight
You’d better change your ways’ separate wrong from right
That’s right
I’m spittin’ out another dose of reality
Take it or leave it it’s just a technicality
Sick and tired of indecision
Turnin off the television
Ain’t no place to find religion
Catch you on the flip side
Bite your lip and start to rockin’
Two-faced double talkin
These boots are made for walkin
Catch you on the flip side

Love would always be something that come and go
Oh well

It seems everything has changed dramatically
I can tell

You'd know how I feel
Cause when a love is true
The way that I love you
Love is forever
Forever loving you
Beyond space and time
Above the stars that shine
Love is forever
Forever loving you
And then you came along
I didn't care what's right or wrong
All that really mattered is you came my way
Now I don't just sing about it
I do believe without a doubt
There ain't no doubt each and every day
This thing called love will always find a way
I know what I know
I know it's real
If you'd listen to my heart
You'd know how I feel
Cause when a love is true
The way that I love you
Love is forever
Forever loving you
And this old heart of mine
For you will always shine
Love is forever
Forever loving you
When the rain came pouring down
With the wind blowing all around
So hard that it knocked my feet off of the ground
Hope was all I could hold on to
There was nothing else left, what could I do?
And finally it was love that saw me through
So I hope what'll happen to me
Happens to you
Cause when a love is true
The way that I love you
Love is forever
Forever loving you
Beyond space and time
Above the stars that shine

Is something that i can use
I'll never be your alibi

Knowing that i'd rather die
Than have my words be insincere

So give me the reason not the excuse
Even the things i can hardly believe

Keep puffin, Mary Jane
Drugs help us stay insane
Avoiding sobriety
The evil ones face the wrath of God and his diety
Saturday nights are cold and dark still
Dangerous thrills give us all a little spark still
Try to make the most but what's the most when you can't
You forget about your family, all your uncles and your aunts
We all feel things we don't really wanna feel
That's just how we know what's fake and what's real
Cuz in the end emotions are the deciding factor
What's fake and what's real, and who are the actors
Who are the real ones, razor blades and steel guns
Never really thought to run cuz nighttime will turn to sun
Rise and shine for the early morning grind
Shoot some thoughts if you wanna kill your mind
Look deep in yourself and see what you find
See we all humans and we all the same kind
The thoughts you have determine your life
You don't gotta be sick and ill with the strife
We all think we're best, better than the rest
But in the end, times the hardest test
We all gotta go, one way or another
So be sure to always thank your father and your mother
For giving you life, however you want to use it
But life always ends the same

627,Tesla,In A Hole Again,"Don't want anyone to know
Who I really am so they'll never see
All the things I hide behind these precious walls
I built just for me
So if they look into the windows of my soul
All they're gonna see
Are my eyes starin' back
And not shattered glass or the broken side of me
'Cause I'm so afraid to show my darkest secrets
I keep them wrapped in chains
And locked up in a place where no one goes
But I'm sure my insecurities will give it all away
I'm heading fast straight for a crash and burn
For me there is no shame
(I'm going down) Back in a hole again
(Deep underground) I'm in a hole again
(Where no one's around) And I don't need a friend
(So safe and sound) Back in a hole again
I'm finally back of course behind the mask
I've always worn for you
To distract you, since I couldn't face the fact
That someone ever knew
That all I am is just some smoke and mirrors
And a gun pointin' back at you
And you to catch me in the act of this
I know it would be through
All these years I've lived in fear
That you would find out
Just exactly what I'm made of
Or what I'm really all about
And it would kill me just to see you
Point your finger and hear you say
""You're one of them."" and this I could not stand
So I'll be on my way
(I'm going down) Back in a hole again
(Deep underground) I'm in a hole again

Is one of my best friends
What you see as sawed up logs
Is the house that I live in
What you call a pile of stones
Is the foundation of my home
And we all know there’s nothing sweet as home, sweet, home

You’ve got to let it flow
Let that river flow

There was a shadow, following me around
Somehow i lost my way, that was then, take a look at me now
Chorus
For everything in life, there is a reason
Sometimes the reason i do, make it not so good
Verse 2
Seems like all that time away took me one step closer to my suicide
Spun around like i jus got played, all caught with the users and the crucified
A shining example of what you never wana be
The fame of teachers drowning in a wishing well
With no apology
Me and my shadow, no-body else around, somehow i lost my way, that was then take a look at me now

Mama I ain't no fool - I've just been fooled again
Mama she raised no fool - you did not raise no fool
Mama I ain't no fool - well I've just been fooled again

Too many hearts goin' straight down the tube

Forever scolding me, Don't let the same dog bite you twice

All the time that I spent missing home
And I try not to complain
But sometimes it won't leave me alone
And I think that I know myself better than anyone else
Cause I'm me I ought to know
What I want, what I need, what's inside of me
Maybe something that took, to get out of my head
Or took for the thrill
The way that I dress, the way that I look, or the way that I pay the bills
Cause your miles away, miles away
How could you be so wrong
Cause your miles away, miles away
How could you know the score
All eyes on the stage now the glitter and the glow
Move to the rhythm while striking a pose
Music and melody words to a poem
You think that you know me, you're not even close
Though I'm living out my dreams
Wasn't long 'till I figured it out
Nothin' ever comes for free
Even here on a merry-go-round
So you wanna take a ride
Rollin' and living the life
Cause you think I got it made
Well in case you don't know my friend died today
And it's tearing me apart
If I knew what to say, don't know where to start
I reach down in my heart and with paper and pen put it in a song
'Cause you're miles away, miles away, how could you be so wrong?
'Cause you're miles away, miles away, how could you know the score?
All eyes on the stage, all the glitter and glow
Move to the rhythm while striking a pose
Music and melody and words to a poem
You think that you know me, You're not even close
The pages have burned but they're written in stone
Now what will become of us now nobody knows
And the wheel keeps on turning and I rise and I fall
And I'll try to get back but I'm lost in it all
And I look all around and I see that it's gone

Thunder rolled and the lightning bolts come crashin' to the ground
Cold as ice, hard as stone, as he walks into the room
With another man who was feeling the same way, all hell's breakin' loose

Bang bang, shoot 'em up, bang bang, blow you away
It's a showdown in the no man's land, for the cowboy of the modern day
Come sundown, don't be hangin' round, cause the cowboy'll blow you away

Al Capone and the Bad Boy Jones, on the wrong side of the law
Johnny D and his company, always first to the draw
Gangster lean, feelin' so mean, I try to take more than their share
Cause all they saw was ruling it all, the scent of blood was in the air

Bang bang, shoot 'em up, bang bang, blow you away
It's a showdown in the no man's land, for the cowboy of the modern day
Come sundown, don't be hangin' round, cause the cowboy'll blow you away

So here we are and we've come this far, but it's only getting worse
Foreign lands with their terrorist demands, only cause the good to hurt
The U.S.A., the U.S.S.R., with their six-guns to the side
I see the message written on the wall, too much anger deep inside
Bang bang, shoot 'em up, bang bang, blow you away

Come sundown, don't be hangin' round, cause the cowboy'll blow you away

Outside the door, she took four more

They just don't appreciate that you get tired
They're so hard to satisfy. You can tranquilize your mind

It'a a little bit fiction but fact when you see
So if you got the balls come inside with me
To the life I can live without
To the life where it's one big freak show
Round and round upside down
Keep the wheels rollin'
Through the dead of the night
500 miles 'til broad daylight
Ya party 'til 6 ya sleep 'til it's 5
Then you're playin for the people
To keep the dream alive
In my soul a true infection
In my soul a constant erection
Of the body and the mind
Yeah that's the life my friend
When you're on the road again
New York to Japan on the road again
All across the land
Got the tour bus, hotels, and the limousines
Got my face plastered on every magazine
Got the managers, lawyers, and the record execs
Pullin' me in and out but it sure ain't like sex
And my mama's always naggin' about
The MTV Son why ain't you #1? You're only #3
But it's all packed up and the day is done
I know I live this life 'cause I live for fun
Yeah when you're on the road again
New York to Japan on the road again
All across the land on the road again
L.A. to Londontown on the road again

I wish to wipe away the tears and all the things I want to say

There that's better
I'm overjoyed at all the games I'm playing here with you today

It happened
In the broad daylight
So unexpected came the knife
A child's scream
Sliced through the air
But no one came
Or seemed to care
No!
The man's description
Did little good
A local stranger
From the neighborhood
Those little kids
Ohh, he left behind
With their mangled lives
And their tortured minds
Since he didn't seem to care
Then don't you think it's only fair?
Call for street justice
Let no mercy show
Call for street justice
Don't let him go
The man was caught
And brought before a judge
Who had just returned
From a three drink lunch
His lawyer screamed ""You must set him free""
And off he went
On a technicality
Since the law don't seem to care
Then don't you think it's only fair?
Call for street justice
Why should parents cry?
Call for street justice
How many have to die?
The mob assembled
Smoke filled the air
And marched in anger
To do what's fair
To bring to justice
This soulless thing
And show the others
What evil brings
Now before you shake your head
Think if it was your child instead
Call for street justice
Tell me what you'd do
Call for street justice
Pray this isn't true
Call for street justice
Why should parents cry
Call for street justice
How many have to die
Call for street justice
When slime escapes the law
Call for street justice
We'll even up the score
Call for street justice
Let no mercy show
Call for street justice
Get him, get him, get himEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

If I fall, to set me right
Someone there to hold the light
Won't someone say
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
It's so hard to do it all yourself
Fighting for your dreams alone
When the toy's upon the highest shelf
A child's tears soon become stone
Oh why does no one lend a hand
Why does no one understand
Why I need to make a stand
Ohh, it's so hard to carry on
When all your hope is gone
All your dreams have come undone
I need to hear
I believe in you

Why won't someone say these words
Are they really so absurd?
Must they always go unheard?

I hear them laugh and shout at me
King of the fools
They shake their heads in disbelief
King of the fools
Oh I'm the king, king of the fools

Better a fool than just a clone

There he is, let's ask him
Hey man, is that your ring she's wearin'?
Uh, huh
Man, it must be great ridin' with her
Are you pickin' her up after school today?
Uh uh
By the way where'd you meet her
I met her at the candy store
She turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture?
Yeah, we see
That's when she fell for
The leader of the pack
Her folks were always putting me down
They said I came from the wrong side of town
They told her that I was bad
But she knew I was sad
That's why she fell for
The leader of the pack
One day her dad said find someone new
She had to tell me that we were through
I stood there and asked her why
But all she could do was cry
""I'm sorry I hurt you""
The leader of the pack
She was so small
As she kissed me goodbye
Her tears were beginning to show
And as she drove away on that rainy night
I begged her to go slow
If she heard I'll never know
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I felt so helpless what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
The gang they all stop and stare
I can't hide my tears but I don't care
I'll never forget her
The leader of the pack
Leader of the pack
And now she's gone

All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing

742,Twisted Sister,Sin After Sin,"So, you don't realize
Exactly what you do
And though you never compromise
It's all been up to you
The life you've been leading
Has you up to here in sin
You never like to think about it
Now you just can't win
You're committing (sin after sin)
Can't you feel it? (Sin after sin)
It's so real it's (sin after sin)
Just look around you (sin after sin)
Satan's found you
Thought yourself respectable
But deep inside you know
You've violated all the rules
And never let it show
Figuring you had time
To straighten out the lie you lead
You didn't stop to notice
As your soul began to bleed
From committing (sin after sin)
Can't you see now (sin after sin)
You ain't free now (sin after sin)
You're committed to damnation (sin after sin)
Lest you repent there's no salvation
He's manipulating, salivating
Promising only lies
First he'll confuse you, then abuse you
He's ever on the rise
You've got to realize
It is he who tolls the bell
You must open up your eyes
Before you're burning deep in hell
You're committing (sin after sin)
Can you feel it (sin after sin)
It's so real it's (sin after sin)
Just look around you (sin after sin)
Oh my God, now Satan's found you
Sin after sin, ahh
Sin after sin, ahh
Come on now
Sin after sin, ahh

It starts up in the morning when the kids are at school
Hubby's just forbidden by the home of his poo
She walks across the room and she turns on the set
Every show is memorized, she can't forget
Early morning quiz is essential to watch
Would I win a car or a bottle of scotch
All that she can do is sit home and stare
And hope that there she gets a chance to go on the air
(CHORUS:)
'Cause she's a TV wife with a TV life
From early in the morning 'til late at night
Her dreams and fears and wishes and her hopes
Are all being sued by a handful of soaps
For she's a TV wife with a TV life
From early in the morning 'til late at night
Your dreams are your visions and your lacks of strife
But everybody turns you to TV wife, everybody turns you to TV wife
TV wife, TV wife
By mid-afternoon the shows have progressed
And anchors all the characters of who she's obsessed
This was dying, that was married, this one gave birth
And the hunters nowhere took we found on this planet Earth
Hubby's home and dinner's on the wine or TV
Well, the news is on and it's just too impossible, you see
After twenty tumors, fifteen rapes and countless affairs
I can't watch the news, it's too gross, she declares

Long as there's light breaking through the night, I'm never gonna crash
And if I'm down and out one day, I won't throw in the deuce
I'll just kick it out, thrash about till I tear it loose, oh

Long before the storm
But you can't hear the lion when he stalks his prey
He's moving like a shadow
Creeping up on you
And like a siren's call he's gonna have his way
You'd better run, forget your pride
Don't make a stand, just step aside
If you don't have what it takes
Don't try to play you'll lose your stakes
Remember this at least
It's the nature of the beast
It's the nature of the beast
You won't hear a footstep
Comin' up on you
Movin' like a snake he's in complete control
This killer knows his business
He is the predator
You are his only target, you're his only goal
What will you say what will you do?
Your wildest nightmare's comin' true
There is nothing you can say
No way to change, he won't delay
This cain will have his feast
It's the nature of the beast
It's the nature of the beast
If you play you're bound to lose
Don't roll the dice, don't turn the screws
Just listen to the priest

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

To last many lifetimes
Yet still it grows, and the more that it shows
I won't have peace of mind
The fire, the fire still burns
The fire, the fire still burns
I have a dream
And as strange as it seems
There's no embers glowing
The fire's gone out and there's no need to shout
'Cause no anger's showing
But it's not true, nothing I ever do
Seems to ease my fury
Get out of my way

Taken by the tide

Missing in action
Taken for a ride

What you can't see makes you scream
What you don't know sure can hurt you
What you don't have is what you dream
Your brain is filled with questions
You don't know how or why
Don't look to me for answers, honey
'cause I don't want to lie
How do you like it so far?
Say ain't we quite a show?
There's no one else quite like us
The others all get up and go
Don't fill my head with stories
You see I ain't no debutante
Let's get to the nitty gritty
Now you give me what I want
What you don't know sure can hurt you
What you can't see makes you scream
What you don't know sure can hurt you

You can't believe all the things i've done wrong in my life

To thine own self be true, so i think that it's time for a turn
Before i burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
Take a good look in your heart, tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late

Late for the hanging, yes he's heading for the moon
Hang 'em High
Leather, across his thighs
Blasting out the night, he's terrified to drive
One eye on the road, crashed upon his head
One ear to the ground, he's listening to the dead
He comes from nowhere, returns on his own
Late for the hanging, yes he's heading for the moon
Hang 'em High
Alone to himself, he's laughing up his sleeve
Looking back in anger, the city is relieved
Vision of Light
Child of the night

I was in love, but Cupid missed me
She upped and left, and I almost died

Needed a girl to call my one and only

Well, ain't life grand when you finally hit it?
I'm always a sucker for a real good time
Woke up in life to find I almost missed it
Ain't I glad that love is blind?

To change your life to lose your place in time
Contact! Asleep or awake
Coming around you may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever, you realize

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string

Another world, some other time
You lay your sanity on the line
Familiar faces familiar sights
Reach back, remember with all your might
Ooh, there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

Ah, sleep and dream, that's all I crave
I travel far across the Milky Way
To my master I become a slave
Til we meet again some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

You got Jesus in the west

Just kill the pain

Speaking the word of God
Provin' to be a fraud

851,Van Halen,Stay Frosty,"I journeyed to the North
To hear what the preacher said
He said, ""your arms are too short to box with God
Learn these words instead""
Gold tooth reflected
""My advice is free
There's a trick to Christian values and its compulsory.""
Stay Frosty
That's what the preacher man said
Stay Frosty
His words still racket in my head
Can't control your future
Can't control your friends
In a world without end...
Stay Frosty
Stay Frosty now, alright
I travelled to the South
The ancient Rabbi appeared to me
Voice heavy with the sands of time, he made me see
""Same as Kabalah Dave but for you it's free
God guides us on our journey
But careful with those feet""
Stay frosty
In a world without end
Stay Frosty
Like the ancient immortals said
Don't want 'em to get your goat
Don't show 'em where it's hid
But that's just what I did
Stay Frosty!
Look out
Stay Frosty!
I journeyed to the East
And I struggled to stay afloat
A solitary Buddhist Monk threw me a rope
Looked me in the eye
And said, ""Don't make me say this twice
You want to be a monk, you got to cook a lot of rice""
Stay Frosty
In a world without end
Stay Frosty
Work hard at this my friends
Look beyond the Kung Fu fighting
God is love
But get it in writing
Stay Frosty
Stay Frosty now
I wandered out West
To the California Coast
Where the folks who know about frostiness stay frostiest the most
My brand new landlord proposed me a toast
""My West Coast host""
Stay Frosty
Chant it like a Mantra
Stay Frosty
And there's nothing you can't handle
Far and wide far as you ramble
Trust in Allah
But tie up your camel, and remember...

Try and figure you out

How long can this go on
Tell me what is wrong
And maybe there's a way
That we can work it out
There must be some kind of way
That we can make it right
But I, I just can't do it all
Without you, without you

Nowhere to run, no the proud, they never hide
Live by the gun--aces high, come on let it ride

I was sixteen going nowhere, will I see seventeen alive
And I was running from the nightmare

With wrath to reign and with slaves to flame

Six hundred six, six and seven seals
A pale rider and his horses sing
Babylon's a-burning, Babylon's a-burning
Six hundred six, six the rising beast
Bears the mark of Babylon to be
Arising with the beast, a sea of men
A bloody moon of red
A whore of Babylon to bleed the seed
And make 'em take the mark upon their heads
They bowed and kneeled a mark to seal their souls unto a kiss
With fire and flames and with souls to claim
And rise from the abyss

And I stood upon the sand of the sea
And saw a beast rise out of the sea
Having ten horns and seven heads
Ten crowns upon his head
Who is like unto the beast?
Given his mouth great things to speak
If any man has an ear
Let him hear, let him hearEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

Show me there's a reason to keep believing you're the one
My knees are buried at your cross

Tell me where I'm going now, tell me am I going down
Are you who they say you claim? Remember me this night
Breathe and hear me now, ooh bring me alive
Show me all Golgotha's my shadows forever tonight

Jesus I need you now, free me I'm lost somehow
Oh, remember me today, I'm a leper left to hang
Oh, yes I need you now
Jesus I need you now, show me I'm lost somehow
Oh, and show me there's a way from the cross from where I hang
Oh see me bleed, I need you now

Oh, is there no hope for me?
Oh, somewhere you'll show for me?
Oh, I'm holding on believing there's a reason I can find
Oh, oh, Lord remember me, take me up tonight

Cause all of history is written by winners

To carnivorous hyenas in a global theft fest
I've mastered the arts of death and foreign nations genocide
And those who turn on me commit national suicide
I'm the queen of the global dream
And I rule a declining nation
I sit and watch all the violent screams
From the throne of your desperation
I killed them all and stole their land
Enslaved the blacks and slaughtered the red man
In God we trusted and I gave birth
To would be kings to rule the earth
I have more pigs than I have tits to feed
I embrace the world's phoney leaders
And hold the sucklings to my breast
And I'd fool you all as I'd feed ya
I'll prop you up then strike you down
And lick your blood up form your ground

No colors anymore, I want them to turn black

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

With flowers and my love, both never to come back

Never see the sight of me that changes every day
I want you to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
Paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
I want you to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
No more will my dream's eagle turn a deeper blue (handcuffed, handcuffed)

If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and it has been painted black

Some sedation to stop what you see

Trust me you fool

Two will kneel
They can't see who they are
A reflection is cast
On a conscience of war

The plaything of men
The true alter ego
The phantom within

Put a luggage in my hands

Of mourn and memories
In the wind

My soul is bargaining - in the end
Is there no sun?
With only love in vain - and it's pain

Cleanse me evermore with
Your blood of rain

A privileged invitation to the last rights of me
Remember me? You can't save me
Mama you never needed me
No crimson king, look in my eyes, you'll see
Mama I'm lonely, it's only me, it's only me

Be careful what you wish for, it might just come true
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy
The strap on my back
Red, crimson red, no I was never to be
Only one crimson son, no it never was me
Living in the limelight little did I know
I was dying in the shadows and the mirror was my soul
It was all I ever wanted, everything I dreamed
But the dream became my nightmare and no-one could hear me scream
With these six-strings, I make a noose
To take my life, it's time to choose
The headlines read of my demise, of my suicide
Oh sweet silence, where is the sting
I am no idol, no crimson king
I'm the imposter, the world has seen
My father was the idol, it was never me

And ride the bloody trail of no return
Sleeping in the arms of a nightmare
And wake to find we've been away too long

The bloody boys that sing a wicked song
And for all of them they're just memories in the wind
Rise and see

Keeper of the gates of fire

975,W.A.S.P.,The Story of Jonathan (Prologue to the Crimson Idol),"I was born Jonathon Aaron Steel, to the parents of William and Elizabeth steel. I am a Leo, born under the sign of the lion and I was raised in a lower middle class family with only one brother Michael whom I love dearly. He was five years my senior. My father's nickname was Red which I could never understand why because his hair was sandy blond. Nevertheless, the name stuck. So when my brother was born my father became Big Red and my brother Little Red
I should have known from the first time when I realised their special connection, that I just didn't fit in to my father's plans. And as I grew older the constant comparison between my brother and myself left little doubt who was the image of perfection in my father's eye. To him, my brother could do no wrong and I became The Invisible Boy, the proverbial 'black sheep' and I soon figured out that red and black don't mix. The beatings I received became more and more frequent to the point where I would ask my father ""Am I the orphaned son you would never need""? But oddly enough I worshipped the ground my father walked upon
My brother and I were a strange mixture, as different as daylight and dark. Looking back, it's hard to imagine we came from the same parents. I sometimes wondered if we had the same father, but I always dismissed that idea as my mother was far too religious, my father as well, to ever even think of such a thing. But my brother who had always sensed my parent's instilled insecurities tried his best to encourage me. For I was born different and he knew it. He often told me when I was born an angel flew over my bed and christened me with a magic wand and said ""You shall be the one."" And I had no idea what 'The one' was, but as I grew older I began to understand. Most boys put their mother on a pedestal and worship them like the Virgin Mary but with her too my relationship was different and not for the good. She was opinionated, uneducated, sometimes prejudiced, overbearing, believed everything she read, true or not, and when it came to religion was over-zealous to say the least. A mind boggling combination but she was pretty, very pretty and I would often wonder, bordering on complete confusion, how a person of this description could rationalise life
This was a series of characteristics that many times in my life I would look back on in bewilderment and the women I sought after when I was older would be nothing like her. In the pain of youth, the misery of my neglect, would manifest itself in many ways; depression - my enemy, fear - my friend, hatred - my lover, and anger - fuel for my fire. These four characteristics of my personality would become the guiding force of my life and would control everything I did or was to become. I shall explain later in the story about them which I call my Four Doors of Doom
The mirror, the great plaything for man's vanity. The mirror was to become, at times, my altar of refuge and other, my alter ego and its magnificent obsession with a relentless pursuit of attention. It served as a chilling reflection of my own wretchedness and my greatness. It was the one place I could go to see inside myself, to find love, in an otherwise loveless household where I could be great, where I could be anything or anyone I wanted to be - one hundred percent pure escapism until I discovered its precious secret. The mirror lives, it breathes, it talks, it lies, it has a personality all its own. It is a genie that grants all the wishes you could ever dream, at least in my case - all except two
It was my 14th birthday, the day that changed my life forever. My brother Michael, the one person who was my guiding light, my friend, my hero, was killed by a drunk driver in a head-on collision. He died instantly. I couldn't even bring myself to go to his funeral. My agony was so great I just couldn't come face to face with him that one last time. My failure to attend intensified my parents' resentment for me even more. But from that moment on, nothing seemed to matter, especially that living hell called 'home'. For one year after his death I roamed the streets in a fog barely conscious of anything or anyone. I discovered alcohol, and girls, drugs and in general a life I had never known which was exciting, frightening and wonderfully dangerous. And it was then as I staggered through a down town city street in one of my drunken rages I stumbled across a small music shop and in the window stood the instrument, the fiery tool that would become the object of my new found desire. The instrument of my passion, my obsession, the blood-red six string. It was like I'd known the thing all my life
I soon found it was the only way I could truly express myself. It was a way to vent all my frustrations and all my pain - completely opened all my Four Doors Of Doom and I found myself going to the mirror for counsel less and less. Because of this my songs seemed to write themselves and I knew my destiny was in my music but I was going to have to get out of this backwards town I was in if I was ever going to succeed. I was 16 going nowhere and the only thing my parents knew was 'live, work, die.' And if I stayed there that was exactly what was going to happen to me - I was gonna die. So I ran away to the big city with the lights, excitement and danger and a chance for me to finally live and do my music without the persecution I had known for so long
I hitchhiked all the way with a suitcase in one hand and my guitar in the other and as I stood at the edge of the city the magic of the place was incredibly intense. It was to be my new home the place I would call the 'Arena Of Pleasure'. I lived and struggled in the arena for two years trying to get a break in music and make a record and that's when I ran across a delightful business man named Charlie. He had been a lawyer for 25 years before he discovered he could fuck over more people in the recording industry then he ever could in a court of law and he was the president of one of the biggest record companies in the world. The music business to Charlie was nothing more than a sacrificial lamb to be led to slaughter and the weapon of choice was his record company that he'd wield like a mighty sword. The great tool he would lovingly refer to as 'The Chainsaw'. The morgue, Charlie said, was the music business where everyone sells out. Where all the artists will eventually whore themselves to commercialism, the place where the music comes to die. And through him I learned everything I needed to know about the music business and even things I didn't want to know. He said he could make me a star, one of the biggest things the world had ever seen. The big time was calling and I was on my way. He introduced me to an aspiring young manager named Alex Rodman and together we took on the whole fucking world and kicked it square in the ass
Just before the release of my first album I was sitting on the steps in front of my apartment when a gypsy woman passed by. She stopped and asked me if I would like my fortune read and I had never had it done so I was more than happy to say yes. She revealed a deck of Tarot cards and began to tell me of my past in which she went into great detail about the pain of my youth, my brother and my parents. She saw my present with my great struggle to succeed and fulfillment of my dreams and new found happiness but after about ten minutes she stopped and I wanted to know of my future and pleaded for her to go on and finally she spoke. She showed me a very disturbing vision of where I was going. I told her that I wanted a phenomenal wealth and fame and in the cards she saw a fallen hero and looked at me and said ""Be careful what you wish for - it might come true, for the face of death wears the mask of the King of Mercy."" I asked her if she was sure of what she had seen and with a blank stare she turned and walked away leaving me with the cards and a haunting that would follow me the rest of my life
Success agreed with me with amazing ease. The more records I sold the more excess I had of everything - friends, money, women, cars, houses. It was at one of my nightly hedonisms where a flash individual entered the room. He introduced himself as the Doctor. I asked him what kind of doctor and he smiled and said, ""meet my friend Uncle Sam."" The mirror that was once on the wall, my alter ego, was now talking to me from the table and the next three years were a blur. Drugs became the new candy and alcohol became the new Coca Cola and Doctor Rockter was my new best friend and I never heard the mirror speak again until tonight
I was at the peak of my career and the world saw me as I had always wanted it, The Idol, the Great Crimson Idol. Now I had everything it seemed, everything but the one thing that would have meant more to me than anything. The pain that manifested itself into my obsession, the acceptance of me by my father and mother, who I had not spoken to since I had left home
One morning my manager Alex came in and broke up one of our nightly Easy Rider Parties. An Easy Rider Party was when everybody would come over to my house, the band, the doctor, hot and cold running women etc. And we'd watch the movie and do everything going on the film only a lot more. And he threatened to leave me if I didn't clean up. It was not that he cared about me as a person he was only interested in my talent and what I could do to further his own career as a true showbiz mogul. But it was then I realised just how far things had gone. So I sat there alone in my palace of pain and I was just numb from the alcohol and the drugs but equally as intoxicated by my own fame and I had just enough courage to pick up the phone and dial the number. My mind went into a whirlwind thinking of what would happen and the fear overcame me and I started to put down the phone but before I could a voice at the other end rang out and it sent a chill through me that I had never known. It was my mother. It was hard for me to speak, my heart pounding out of my chest but when I did I did the best I could. She was very cold. But I knew the shock of suddenly hearing from me after all these years was overwhelming and I was hoping that all the time that had passed would heal the deep wounds between my parents and me but...I desperately wanted them to approve of me, to accept me - it was all I ever wanted. I hoped my success would finally prove my worthiness and they would welcome the prodigal son home. All I wanted was for them to be proud of me but less than 50 words were spoken. The last four were ""We have no son.""
Some wounds never heal and mine had scarred me for life. A great star fell from the sky that night and with its descent left a scorched path in its way - a great path of self-destruction before burning out. And on this night the great finale is finally here. 'Be careful what you wish for - it may come true.'
Long live, long live the King of MercyEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

Wasn't caused by fans

And the nuclear ring around the moon
Was caused by man

A little out of focus

Rat race I say
Run off and join the circus

You will see things
That you probably shouldn't see
Because my outside is off center

Pulling your insides out
Cause they're burning
You feel caged
Like an animal that wants to fuck

For something strange, unexpected
Unexplainable to happen

Leaves you hurt

1022,Warrant,Hell Bent For Leather,"Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels! A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams! From a streak of fire as he strikes

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools! Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams! Crash one by one to the ground


There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried

It's the flowers laid when we're laid to rest
It feels like heaven is falling

Out on the strip last night
He had the sweetest eyes
Told her pretty lies
Made feel her just right
She just wants to love someone
And feel alive like the morning sun
Jimmy's got a rock band
Playin' on the strip that's right
Do the show get paid
Get high and get laid
Just like he did last night
He just lookin' to have his fun
He don't care about anyone
Late at night she's cold and lonely
And she's feelin' like the only one
And I wish that I could tell her
When the morning comes around
She's not the only broken heart in town
Only broken heart in town
Mary gets all dresses up
Goes out to surprise her man
She caught Jimmy behind the dressing room door
Pants down with some long legged fan
She didn't mean to kill no one, no
In a jealous rage her deed was done
Late at night she's cold and lonely
And she's feelin' like the only one
And I wish that I could tell her
When the morning comes around
She's not the only broken heart in town
Only broken heart in town
Ten years lost in a prison cell
With the same old sad sad tale to tell
Late at night she's cold and lonely
And she's feeling like the only one
Late at night she's cold and lonely
And she's feelin' like the only one
And I wish that I could tell her

He searches out a place to
Drink his daily bread

In alcohol
It keeps him warm at night

When he was a child
With everything planned
And his body was clean
Now he sits all alone in
A room with a view
With the brick wall he's run into
Life has a way of leaving
People like him stained
First thing she does
When she goes out at night
She sells a smile to get
What fills her up inside
She brings plenty home
And slowy gets stoned
In a room by herself
Alone in a room with a view
Of the brick wall
She's run into
Life has a way of leaving

And then I'm found
Sometimes I feel
Turned inside out
I'm often silent when I'm screaming inside
Instead of love
We tend to hate
We never quite
Appreciate
How much the other person cares or tries
Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
'Cause I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why
Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains, it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door?
All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill
And when I'm right
I'm also wrong
We give and take
To get along
There's so much more to this than I ever dreamed
And when you smile
I have to laugh
And when you cry
I'm torn in half
So calm and yet so loose at the seams, oh
Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why
Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains, it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door?
All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill
Liebe kann eine bittere Pille sein
Eine bittere Pille
Liebe ist eine bittere Pille
Eine bittere Pille
Liebe kann eine bittere Pille sein
Ich will ein Bier
Ich will besoffen sein
Die ganze Welt ist dumm
Mir steht es so im Hals
Ich sage dir
Die liebe kann nur luge sein

Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
'Cause I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why
Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains, it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door?
All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill

Me and Uncle Tom were fishin', it was gettin' pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where they say it got no bottom, say it take you down to hell
Over in the bushes and off to the right
Come two men talkin' in the pale moonlight
Sheriff John Brady and Deputy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the water's edge
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
Neither one believin' what the other could see
Tossed in the bodies, let 'em sink on down
To the bottom of the well where they'd never be found

I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies in the wishin' well

Soon as they were gone, me and Tom got down
Prayin' real hard that we wouldn't make a sound
Runnin' through the woods back to Uncle Tom's shack
Where the full moon shines through the rooftop cracks
Oh my God, Tom, who are we gonna tell?
The Sheriff, he belongs in a prison cell
Keep your mouth shut, that's what we're gonna do
Unless you wanna wind up in the wishing well too
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell

And justice will be done
And the eagle will fly
When the battle has begun
And a hero will rise
He will be the one they'll all be talking about
In a thousand years or more
He was born a warrior One of a kind
He will always be that
Nothing could ever change his mind
The spirit can't be broken
The heart won't ever change
There'll be no retreat No surrender
He will not give up the land that is his

And justice will be done
And the eagle will fly
When the battle has begun
And a hero will rise
He will be the one they'll all be talking about

For the wounded soldiers
There is nothing they can do
But we will remember
That their bravery
Was their very last mistake
From above the battle the sun shines on the dead
All the native women are taking scalps from the soldiers heads
There is celebration there is victory
They will never fight this way again
They will never live this free again

How they put you down and spit upon your name
You were snow and you were rain

All around the world

So stand up and cry for freedom
And keep the dream alive
Stand up and cry for freedom
And keep the dream alive
Our brothers in prison
But no crime was ever done
I call it racism
Ashamed I face my fellow man
The children are taken away
And families destroyed
And millions have died from starvation
We can't go on this way
Oh Lord we pray, we pray
That maybe soon someday
The world will smile again
And they shall be released

And let them know that we are here
Oh no, we can't go on this way
And we will never give up
Fighting for freedom
Yeah
And we will keep this dream aliveEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

1093,White Lion,Don't Give Up,"Are you tired of working 9 to 5
And are you fed up with your boring life
When your master tells you what to do
Years you wasted looking back at you
When life is driving you crazy
You feel your losing your mind
Don't give up, don't give up
When the road gets rough
Don't give up, don't give up
Even when it's tough
Making money you never have enough
Never-ending bills are building up
And the tax man stalking at your door
Never giving always wanting more
You feel like changing the times
To get some peace in your mind
Don't give up, don't give up
When the road gets rough
Don't give up, don't give up
Even when it's tough
Solo
Don't give up, don't give up
When the road gets rough
Don't give up, don't give up
Even when it's tough
Don't give up,don't give up
Don't you ever give up
Don't give up, you can make it
Don't give up, you can do it tonight
Don't give up, you can tell'em
Don't give up, you can show'em alright

And look on down at the world from above
If you could travel the endless journey
And go somewhere you love

1096,White Lion,El Salvador,"He could barely remember
When the fighting began
It was early September
When he lost his old man
Soon the time came to leave there
And to start a new life
How it seems so unfair
When they gave him a gun and a knife

So he fights with a gun in his hand
For a reason he can't understand
Fights with a gun in his hand
For the freedom of their land

Can you hear the crying out
All the people in El Salvador
Can you hear a distant shout
From the people in El Salvador
Cross your heart and hope to die
For the people in El Salvador
Still they kill not knowing why
All the people in El Salvador
As he stares at the ceiling
He thinks back quite away
It was him that was feeling
Tellin' you those were the days
As he stares at a white dove
Tears fall down on his face
And they run through without
That only God himself can replace

So he fights with a gun in his hand
For a reason he can't understand
Fights with a gun in his hand
For the freedom of their land

Can you hear the crying out
All the people in El Salvador
Can you hear a distant shout
From the people in El Salvador (save them)

No!
Can you hear them cry?
Can you see them die?
Can you tell me why? Oh no
See them die, hear them cry, tell me why
No!

Can you hear the crying out
All the people in El Salvador (hear them cry)
Can you hear a distant shout
From the people in El Salvador (see them die)
Cross your heart and hope to die
For the people in El Salvador (tell me why)

Raise high your sword

Tired of singing the same ol' song
Time for a change before too late
And I waited for the phone to ring
No check was in the mail
I gave it all my everything
But now I'm gonna bail
I wasted time hanging around
Let all the good ones go
The dreams I sought I never found
And now where did they go
I sacrificed I paid the price
I fought for what was right
And now I come to realize
I finally see the light
Out on my own doing alright
Don't really care where I spend the night
What I know is I'm moving on
Day by day Town to town
You can say I get around
I should have done it long ago
I followed every word you said
But little did I know
That one day you would leave me dead
With nothing much to show
I wasted time hanging around

That we'd be together through love and hate

1115,White Lion,Lonely Nights,"The little girl standing in the rain
On the corner of 42nd street
And she's all alone on the bad side of town
'Cause there was a little boy
That she loved with all her heart
But he's far away with another girl
Now she's searching for a friend
Just to hold her when she cries
In her lonely nights, lonely nights
Where no one seems to care
In her lonely nights, lonely nights
You better beware
But, baby, you try and you try
But it seems that it doesn't work
'Cause love is a game that they play
So, baby, hold on to your heart
When they tell you that they care
Yeah, now that you know that the winner
Takes what he wants
But she's searching for a friend
Just hold her when she cries
In her lonely nights, lonely nights
Where no one seems to care
In her lonely nights, lonely nights
You better beware
And somewhere in the night
There's a little cry
A girl who says
Hey, I wanna die
There's no one here who cares
But if there's someone here who understands
Just someone here who'll try to lend a hand
And bring her home tonight, tonight
In her lonely nights, etc...EmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

And tears are falling from your eyes
Afraid to make a move
But dying to be touched
When the night is getting long
And we are blind to what is wrong
If only you could see
With you I want to be
When the questions in your head they are killing you
Just remember what I said and promised you promised you
I know I know
I won't ever let you go
And I will love you everyday
And I hope I pray
There won't ever come a day
When we will say goodbye
Cause love can never die
There are times when nothing works
And all you do just getting worse
In your mind you've given up
But waiting to be found
When your hope is gone and lost
And you don't know who you should trust
You're crying out for help
You try to carry on
When the time is running out and it's the end
Just remember what I said and I promised you promised you

We were out to make some noise
Yeah we were out with the boys
We were out to make some noise
I was searching Johnny, I was searching thru town
I heard that someone saw you lying around
I was running, Johnny I was running out of time
When I suddenly found you beat up and fallen apart
I thought about the days when we were young Rn' wild
When every girl out on the streets
Turned when we walked by
Yeah we were out with the boys
We were out to make some noise
Yeah we were out with the boys

There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
It's my baby callin', says I need you here
And it's a half past four and I'm shiftin' gear
When she is lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable comin' in from above
Don't need no phone at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a wave in the air, Radar Love
The radio is playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's comin' on strong
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speedin' into a new sunrise
When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sents her comfort comin' in from above
We don't need no letter at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a light in the sky

No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow
And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's comin' on strong
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh one more radar lover gone

1120,White Lion,Sangre De Cristo,"Searching for the truth we need to know
Questions in our mind don't always tell us where to go
Living with the stories we've been told
Learning from the books and all the mysteries they hold
We want to find the answers We need to know the truth
But if we ever come to realize Two thousand years of lies
We are born then we are shown the way
Some are free to choose and others worship and obey
Some believe in heaven some in hell
Angels fly, and beasts defy Religion made to sell
Crusaders and defenders Fight the holy war
From desert sand to city streets they die- And still I wonder why
But I cease to believe It is how it was meant to be
And I know that I've made up my mind And follow the way that I want
If we read between the lines
Will we find the truth in time
Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel
Trouble at the Tower of Babel
Noah built his ark and sailed away
Dinosaurs walked the earth
Long before the written word
But tell me who was Mary Magdalene
Darwin and the missing link
Those who dare are free to think
Earth is turning like a big balloon
Somewhere in the universe
Far away from our story
Maybe there's another world where everything is right
Say your prayers Save your soul today
Credit card or mail a check How do you want to pay
Saints and sinners live the way they choose
Blasphemy, profanities who can you accuse
Now who has all the answers Who is right who is wrong
Walk on water heal the sick and blind In the end what will we findEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"
1121,White Lion,Set Me Free,"Early in the morning on a bright December day
I was taken from my home and many miles away
Twenty years would pass on by and I'd become a man
Living as a prisoner in a foreign land
Memories something from the past
Dreams that come but never last
Where am I now
Will I ever know
Will they ever let me go
Set me free why don't you
I don't need your chains to hold me
Set me free and let me go
I don't know what I've done
In my cell I dream of freedom
Set me free and let me go
Foreign faces I don't know will never be my friend
I have been here for too long when will this ever end
Take me here take me there I don't understand
Will you find the things you seek in this broken man
Where is home, can I find my way
Will they still remember me
What am I now
Will I ever know
Everything from long ago
Set me free why don't you
I don't need your chains to hold me
Set me free and let me go
I don't know what I've done
In my cell I dream of freedom
Set me free and let me go
Set me free why don't you
I don't need your chains to hold me

1122,White Lion,She's Got Everything,"I went to a party
With a friend of mine
Had a couple of beers
And a bottle of wine
There were plenty of women
Dancing everywhere
They were dressed to kill
And knew what to do
She was so outstanding
I just had to make her mine
She could read me like a letter
I had one thing on my mind
She¹s got everything and I want it
Every little thing she¹s got is fine
She¹s got everything and I want it
Every little thing she¹s got is mine
So we left the party
And went to her place
You could see excitement
Written on my face
So she took me upstairs
Laid me on her bed
When she god undressed
I just lost my head
There were twenty years of woman
There was more than I could eat
She was ready, ripe Rn¹ willing
I just knew she¹s taste so sweet
She¹s got everything, etc
She was like a fire
She burned like a flame
She cried out my name
In her claim to fame
Then I saw her smiling
From her pretty eyes
She said little boy
We¹ve got work to do
Put the log into the fire
And bullets in the gun
You¹ll get what you desire
RCause the night has just begun
She¹s got everything etcEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

Trying so hard calling for you
I had been given a place in your heart

To take me home
Out of the cold
Back in the warmth of your arms
Take me home
Love me to death
Hold me like never before
Somebody told me they saw you alone
Looking so empty eyes like a stone
Far in the distance I called out your name
Hoping that somehow you I'd do the same
Wasting the time wasting the day
Trying to reach you but youâ€™re far away
Deep in the night Ik'm waiting for you

Where only the chosen are allowed
There is a boy with the dream of Valhalla
A place in the land of the gods
Cause in their home where the fire burns forever
The life goes on for those who tell in battle
The gods will wake him the moment he falls in the fight
Cause he'll rise when the sun goes down
He raised high his sword
As he cried out Valhalla
His dream has become reality
Tonight he will ride on the road to Valhalla
Chosen to feast with the gods
Cause in their home where the fire burns forever
The life goes on for the mighty young (viking)
The journey has finally come to and end for the boy
He has risen as the bravest of them all

1137,Whitesnake,Ain't Gonna Cry No More,"Rising with the morning sun
I turn to greet the dawn
Knowing I must face another day
Sleepless night behind me
Just a memory of pain
My heart has always
Been a cross to bear
Lord I know the sun shine
But, I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my sins away
I'll try, hard to remember
So I won't be fooled again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no more today
All around me, shadows fall
Tho' day has just begun
I realise I'm on my own again
Memories of broken dreams
As distant as the sun
Are drifting like an echo
In the wind
Lord, I know the sunshine
But, I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my
Sins away
I'll try, hard to remember
So I won't be fooled
Again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no
More today
Babe, I thought about it
But, it just ain't done
Good
You hold my heart and
Soul within your hand
All the time, you're in my
Mind
I never thought you
Could be so blind
Maybe someday I will
Understand
Lord, I know the sun
Shine
But I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my
Sins away
I'll try hard to remember
So I won't be fooled
Again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no
More today, no more
Hey, mama you drive me
Crazy
Knowing you're my
Hearts desire
Why'd you go and hang
Me up this way
You've given me love
Given me love
Now tell me what you
Were thinking of
Why'd you go and steal
My soul away
Lord I know the
Sunshine
But, I feel the tears of
Rain
Falling down to wash my
Sins away
I'll try hard to remember
So I won't be fooled

Watching the sun go down again

A stray dog howls
When he's lonely in the night
A woman goes crazy
With the thoughts of retribution
But a man starts weeping
When he's sick and tired of life
I keep on dreaming
Dreams of tomorrow
Feel I'm wasting my time
Lighting candles in the wind
Always taking my chances
On the promise of the future
But a heart full of sorrow
Paints a lonely tapestry
The sun is shining
Ooh, but it's raining in my heart
No one understands the heartache
No one feels the pain
No one ever sees the tears
When you're cryin' in the rain
When you're cryin' in the rain
Cryin' in the rain
I can never deny
All the sweet things I've tasted
Though I've been mistreated
I keep coming back for more, more, more
I know where I'm going
There's no hope for absolution
I can't seem to separate
The good times from the bad
The sun is shining
Ooh baby, it's still raining in my heart
No one understands the heartache
No one feels the pain
No one ever sees the tears

The promises of yesterday
Every day of my life, it seems
Trouble's knocking at my door
It's hard to try and satisfy
When you don't know what you're fighting for
Time and again, I sing your song
But I've been runnin' on empty far too long
I've had enough holdin' on to the past
Make no mistake, it could be your last
Don't break my heart again
Like you did before
Don't break my heart again
I couldn't take anymore
I never hide the feeling inside
And though I'm standing with my back to the wall
I know that even in a summer love
A little bit of rain must fall
But every road I take, I know
Where it's gonna lead me to
Because I've traveled every highway
And they all keep coming back to you
Time and again, I sing your song
But I've been runnin' on empty far too long
I've had enough holdin' on to the past
Make no mistake, it could be your last
So don't break my heart again

As I stand at the crossroad
I see the sun sinking low...
With my cross of indecision
I can't tell which way to go...
Now I have seen the seven wonders
And I have sailed the seven seas
I've walked and talked with angels
And danced all night with gypsy queens...
All in all it's been a rocky road
Twists and turns along the way...
But, I still pray for tomorrow
All my hopes, my dreams
Don't fade away... don't fade away...
I have painted many portraits
Memories of love and pain
Though cut down by life's deceptions
I found the strength to start again...
All in all it's been a rocky road
Twists and turns along the way...
But, I still pray for tomorrow
All my hopes, my dreams
Don't fade away... don't fade away
Heaven help a man
Trying to make up his mind
With the darkness closing in
I feel I'm running out of time...
Shine a light for me
Help me find the way to go
And take me where I've never been before...
And so I stand at the crossroad
Watching the sun sinking low...
With my cross of indecision
Trying to find the way to go...
All in all it's been a rocky road
Twists and turns along the way
But, I still pray for tomorrow
All my hopes, my dreams
Don't fade away...EmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

And all your smiles have turned to tears
It seems to me you welcome sadness
As you surrender to your fears
So what's a man like me supposed to do
When all I want is just to make love to you?
Don't turn away before the night is over
Don't turn away before the night is gone
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer
So don't turn away before the night
Before the night is gone
You say your heart is lost forever
And you're always gonna give your love in vain
So you paint yourself a lonely portrait
And hide your love away again
You turn away from what you feel inside
You can't forget all your foolish pride
Don't turn away before the night is over
Don't turn away before the night is gone
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer
So don't turn away, before the night is gone
So now I'm asking you this question
Am I gonna give you all my love in vain
Do you wanna drown in your own sorrow
Or are you gonna try to love again
Don't turn away from what you feel inside
You should try to forget about all your foolish pride
Don't turn away before the night is over
Don't turn away before the night is gone
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer
So don't turn away, before the night, before the night, ooh
Before the night is gone
Don't turn away from me, baby

Just trying to get inside

Playing tricks on my mind?
'Cause when I lit your cigarette
My heart stopped keeping time
When you asked if I could name
The seven deadly sins
Something deep inside said I'm a fool
To let you in

And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days

To find a new day has begun and it promises to stay
To soothe the pain of wasted years
And kiss away the bitter tears, a love to light the way

That reaches out for many miles, touching everyone
No more shadows of the past
Your spirit free to fly at last, shining in the sun
Like rolling thunder, I feel the power of love
It's a gift from Heaven and the Lord above
We walk toward desire
Hand in hand, through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day

I'll do my best to please ya, my love can open any door
When you hear the thunder in your darkest night
I'll be there to hold you when the lightning strikes
So, don't you worry, you can ease your mind
'Cause we'll still be dancing at the end of time
Who loves ya, who needs ya, who'll do his best to please ya

1192,Whitesnake,One of These Days,"I've been thinking about the good times
Gathering souvenirs
Of the days when we were one
Before the love was gone...
Those uncomfortable compromises
Always ending in bitter tears
Taking the love away
Leaving nothing more to say...
But, it's alright
I'll be there one of these days...
& leave it all behind me
One of these days...
A string of broken promises
An eternity of pain
Making enemies of desire
Suffocating all the fire...
But, still I miss your sweet breath
Your kisses on my face
& tho' the love is gone
The memory lingers on...
But, it's alright
I'll be there one of these days...
& leave it all behind me
One of these days
But, it's alright
I'll be there one of these days...
& leave the past behind me
One of these days
You know love has always been
The Queen of Mystery
Broken hearts & bitter tears
Will be the death of me...
One of these days...
But, it's alright
I'll be there one of these days...
& leave it all behind me
One of these days...
But, it's alright
I'll be there one of these days...

I'm tired of wasting
My precious time

Is dull with rust

Shattered and worn

Trying to live my life
In the eye of the storm
Every heartache
Leaves a scar on my face

Or throw me a line
Get me out of this place

Standing on the shore
Head in the clouds
Your pockets filled with dreams
Bound for glory
On the seven seas of life
But, the ocean is deeper than it seems
The wind was with you
When you left on the morning tide
You set your sail for an island in the sun
On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead
For the storm has just begun
Take me with you
Take me far away
Lead me to the distant shore
Sail your ship across the water
Spread your wings across the sky
Take the time to see
You're the one who holds the key
Or sailing ships will pass you by
You cry for mercy
When you think you've lost your way
You drift alone, if all your hope is gone
So find the strength and you will see
You control, your destiny
After all is said and done
So take me with you
Take me far away
An' lead me to the distant shore
Sail your ship across the water
Spread your wings across the sky
Take the time to see
You're the one who holds the key
Or sailing ships will pass
Sailing ships will pass you
Sailing ships will pass you by...
Take me with you
Take me far away
We'll ride the wind across the sky
Spread your wings and you will see
You control, your destiny
So sailing ships don't pass you by
So take me with you

We'll ride the wind across the sky
Spread your wings and you will see

Reaching out, trying to touch each other

Through the dark, cold winds of winter
Our love keeps us warm
While the world tries to separate us

Only when the spell is broken
Only when the curse is cast aside
When I put my arms around you
You slip through my fingers like the sands of time

There's something about you, baby
I’m haunted by your face
Tormented by the thought of you
No one can take your place
So meet me where the river
Flows into the sea
We'll set our sails for the distant horizon
And find our destiny

The winds of change
Are starting to blow

Only when the spell is broken
Only when the curse is cast aside

In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thougt my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing

Even though I'm miles away
I can feel your love around me
You're with me every day
And all the road I've traveled
And all that I've been through

You warm me like the morning sun
With you my life has just begun
Love comes over me
Falling like summer rain
Like summer rain
Pour your love on me
Feeling like summer rain
Like summer rain
I travelled each and every highway
With you in my heart
And all the gold and silver
Can't keep us apart
You warm me like the morning sun
With you my life has just begun

What my life with you'd become
I didn't know and I never really understand it
But every time I see into your eyes
I see the reasons
That I'll always come back,come back to you
Like the air that I breath
Like the land and the sea
Like the hope like the need
Your always within me
I didn't know in the time together
My heart would begin to mend
I didn't know that i'd fall in love again and again
I carry you with every step I take
You are the one
Like the air that I breath
Like the land and the sea
Like the hope like the need
Your always within me
Like the blood in my veins
Like the fire, like the rain
Like the air that I breath
Your always within me
And as long as your heart is willing
And as long as the sun will shine
I will always stand by your side
Like the air that I breath
Like the land and the sea
Like the hope like the need
Your always within me

1233,Winger,Baptized By Fire,"Baptized By Fire (4:11) (Winger/Beach)
Girl, I know you're out for the money
Flesh for gold, diamond and fur
We've seen you workin' on every guy in this town
Trading your voodoo for the bible of who's who
All of your dreams you're searching for gold
I'm not too blind to see your kind
You were baptized by fire, painted by rain
You're under the spell, feeling no shame
Baptized by fire - to you it's a game
You were baptized by fire
From out of the trash to burning desire
Still this pouring rain in your heart
Will keep you spinning in the same direction
Can't you feel it ripping your world apart
All of your dreams you're searching for gold
I'm not to blind to see
(repeat chorus)
It's a sign of the times how people
Mess with your mind
One day they say they love you
Then they leave you behind
It ain't you they want
It's you they haunt
And the weaker they make you
The deeper they take you
Down til you don't know what you feel
What do you feel?
Well, I know your game, it's nothing new, so
You can say good-bye to me cause I have
Said good-bye to you

But she can't give him what he needs
So they're staring across the deep blue sea
Peter's preaching up his storm
Can't get a heaven if you can't find the door
Bernie sold you out to wall street
Pulled the rug right from under your feet
Big word away
So far away
I can see your face
But I can't hear what you say
We're not the same
But can we change
We're like night and day
One big world away
Keep looking round I just don't get it
Live and let live best just forget it
The rich get richer but the poor get poor
Better grab something on the way out the door
From north to south and east to west
Everyone's screaming their way's best
You hear yes when a say no
I know the whole damn world is ready to blow
Big word away
So far away
I can see your face
But I can't hear what you say
We're not the same
But can we change
We're like night and day
One big world away
Everybody's running
Running after something
Nobody will ever find
What will fill the holes
Of all the empty souls left crying
Ghandi starved his way to peace
Met a bullet, fell to his knees
John said ""all you need is love""
But look around you is anyone
Giving enough

Faithfully plays
Heal the scars
Unto his eyes
Salvage the goodness
Of dreams never lived
Dreams never died
Again and again
Again and again
Haunted by the trust of a child
With no place to go now
Little boy brave
Wanders the streets
Faithfully plays
But his broken arrows
Once filled with pride
Aimed and missed
At the dreams never lived
Dreams never died
Again and again
Again and again
Haunted by the trust of a child
Never give in
Never give up
Little boy brave
Never lived
Never died
Appears to be
Blind Revolution Mad
The mercy ends
Where the mercy began
Seems justified
I'm turnin' this around
Jawbreaker Lawmaker
Have it your way
Campaign smokescreen
Glorifies the mainstream
Cities on remote control
Meanwhile vigilante gangs
Dig their fangs into the streets
They've overthrown
While plastic faces
Run for king of this
Disassociation land
I'm dying to find
Anyone who understands
Behold........
One more Blind Revolution Mad
One more chance of a lifetime
Rage runs rampant
Always been abandoned
Killin' for some pocket change
Blames being force fed rules
Governed by fools
Slammin' you against the grain
And the nation's glued to CNN
To watch their own creation
Behold
One more Blind Revolution Mad
One more chance of a lifetime
One more Blind Revolution Mad
Fee Fi Fo Fum
One for all and all for one
Don't try to stop me
I've already gone crazy
One for all and all for one
Overthrow your kingdom come
Don't try to stop me

He had the money the girl and the stretch limousine
There was drums and guitars
Then the beatles and stones
And a million girls never left them alone

I made a deal with the deviil
Fortune and fame, fire and flames
I made a deal with the devil
Teased by the fruit and lead to temptation
It was my school boy dream
I had to rock the nation
I got an electric guitar and joined a rock and roll band
On a world wide tour of the promise land
Party all night, sleep all day
In a rock and roll heaven there's a hell to pay
Traded my soul for rock and roll
I made a deal with the devil
Fortune and fame, fire and flames
I made a deal with the devil
Living in sin, let the party begin'
I made a deal with the devil
Come on, let's go, it's a rock and roll show
Red hot flames will light the sky
These immortal souls
We will walk on hot coals
In a land were you live and never die

The world is in the electric chair

Singing power to the people
But their power's corrupt
Burning crosses and secretly
Carry swastikas and M 16s
Nevermind the pages of history
It just keeps repeating, keeps repeating
It's always the same
Seems like nothing will ever change
We pay to wear the blindfold
Baby look out
'Cos they're movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Yankee Doodle leadin' lambs
To slaughter
Just for the thrill
Good things come to those who wait
Good advice just a bit too late
Any chance for trust went up in smoke
When a preacher's lust was sponsored
By coke
Day after day
It's always the same
We pay to wear the blindfold
Baby look out
'Cos they're movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Disbelievers drink poison water
Time stands still
Don't fill my eyes, fill my head
Till I'm overloaded
You talk and you talk and you talk
But I don't hear anything
Times are changin'
There ain't no cure
It's a wasteland
One thing's for sure
Ain't no gold to grind the axe
So keep your fingers crossed
While you're crossin' the tracks
'Cos good blind faith ain't
Good enough

Don't want Mona Lisa
All I want is your trash
In my veins
Make it last
For days
Want your beast
Need your rage
Feel you burnin' up, sister
In my veins
Devil diggin' deeper
I'm still hangin' by a thread
Don't be talkin' about love
Don't you know that superstition's
Dead
And I ain't nobody' savior
So don't expect no flash
Don't want Mona Lisa
All I want is your trash

You can turn the Kiss of Death
Into Mother of Pearl

Make it last
For days
Want your beast
In my cage
Feel your burnin' up, sister

1253,Winger,In The Day We'll Never See,"In The Day We'll Never See (4: 50) (Winger/Beach/Taylor/Morgenstein)
I was born unto the earth
Mama died on the night of my birth
I grew up with no place to jam
Just hearin' the talk of someone rememberin'
When all the children sang
And all you heard was the word
It's funny how we've changed
We're getting closer
To the day we'll never see the
Rising sun, it's setting
In the day we'll never see
What have we done?
Crucify while you stand by
You hear the call - don't blink an eye
Where will you go, nowhere to run
What can be saved when the damage is done
The world is spinning round
The light of the moon is
Now the tear of the clown
Hear the word, it's coming down
We're getting closer
To the day we'll never see the
Rising sun, it's setting
In the day we'll never see
We're getting closer
To the day we'll never see the
Rising sun, it's setting
In the day we'll never see
The time has come

There's a fire in the heart of the young
Human temples - drawing power from the sun
Raising sails - navigating the dawn
Hear the thunder - now we're a million strong
(Whoa) The lights shines in the heart of the young
(Whoa) We're fighting for a new way to say
""Carry on"" and see behind this material illusion
The future of all is alive in the heart of the young
There's a song in the heart of the young
Loud and clearly the band goes marching on
With the force of a thousand gods
Hear the music - now we're a million strong
(Whoa) Put your trust in the heart of the young
(Whoa) The rise of the rebellion has only
Just begun, the trupets sound off the
Countdown for a new day's dawn, the
Future of all will survive, it's alive
(Show me you're still alive)
And there's fire in the heart of the young
See the lightning strike the curtain
With the force of a thousand gods
Hear the thunder - it's in the
Heart of the young
(Whoa) Can't you feel it burn in the
Heart of the young
(Whoa) We're fighting for a new way to say
""Carry on"", the trumpets sound off the
Countdown for a new day's dawn, the
Future of all is alive in the

She was a classic case, a baby face all
Duded up, but kinda out of place
Out to show the world she was so bad (so bad)
I thought I had it sussed, it was only lust
She's not the type, that I could trust
So how did I end up in her trash?
Tell me is this love?
No, it's anything but love
But I just can't shake the fever
For the little dirty blonde
The thrill is over and my luck is gone
For good I misunderstood
You don't look for love in the neighborhood
Well I guess I stayed just a little too long (too bad)
She won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
And my addiction won't let me be
It just leaves me down, down on my knees
Beggin' for the love
It's anything but love
But I just can't shake the fever
For the little dirty blonde
The girl's as cold as the night is long
Little dirty blonde
The thrill is over and my luck is goneEmbedShare Url:CopyEmbed:Copy"

A new horizon see her touch
Down to Earth flames are breathing
Like volcanoes
Strobes are flashing, needles pinned
Hearts are pounding, she moves in
Here for virtue, lust or sin
Is she my savior
She walks she talks like nothing in the real world
Her body rocks this place like she's from outer space
I got my money for a ticket to ride along
Far from the fray light years away
Late shifts over in this working town
She starts her motor when the sun goes down
Mysterious lover in my darkest dream
She's a midnight driver of a love machine
Her touch gives me a nuclear reaction
Takes me to places where she guarantees to satisfy
Electric rhythm from my head down to my toes
By remote control she'll save your soul
Late shifts over in this working town
She starts her motor when the sun goes down
She runs on sex and gasoline
She's a midnight driver of a love machine
Her shift is over
The smoke has cleared
Vanished from the atmosphere
Love is rendered
Her work is done
Set her spaceship towards the sun
Late shifts over in this working town
She starts her motor when the sun goes down
Mysterious lover in my darkest dream
She's a midnight driver of a love machine
She runs on sex and gasoline

Open your heart, and chances are

Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone; I'm so tired of bein' alone..
With only your promises...
Lonliness just fades away
Thoughts of you; just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me
Hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Lost in her dream of a life in the city

1274,Winger,So Long China,"Now there's nothing left for me to say
There's no way to climb behind your hidden walls
You're untouchable
It wasn't me who made you hurt this way
Somebody made your heart unreachable
You can't let it go
I could have really loved you
Never wanted to say
So long china

So long china
I hope you find what you're looking for...
Ya know I'll miss the tiger in your eyes
The way you saw the world was sad and beautiful
Now I see it all
So many times I tried to read your mind
Free the secret pain that's holding you prisoner
Seemed impossible
I know I won't forget you
I never wanted to say
So long china
Shanghai flower
So long china
I guess I wanted something more
I thought you might want to save it
Before these silver engines touch the sky...fly high
I can hardly believe it
I'm leaving and this really is goodbye...you know I tried
I could have really loved you
Never wanted to say

Woman
Never before
Without a word
I hear so much

Every inch born a new obsession

That I couldn't have helped myself
From comin' closer
To the oracle of faith taboo
All my temptation
Hooked on

You're the spell I'm under
Must be you

I know it must be you

When he fights it's alright
Coz he's on the good side
God and country - wouldn't you do it too
While they're shippin' off his guns he sleeps peacefully because
He tells himself he did it all for love
In the right God we trust and it pays a handsome sum
And they hand out free redemption for your wrongs
Too young to die - too young - can you hear me?

No sun would rise
In my silent heaven
Without your love
Lord knows I've tried
But I keep looking into
Your empty eyes
Don't take for granted
I'll be lyin' here
When the morning comes
If there's still a chance
Tell me now
But don't think I'll be waitin'
Around
While you treat my love
Like it's all a dime a dozen
You don't feel the pain
Baby, you're the lucky one
Every day and night
I keep wondering
Should I just tear out these
Pages
Can't you see it girl
You're the lucky one
Who have you been lyin' to
Is it me baby
Or is it you
How long would you trust
Before your Lady Luck
Gives you up
Any truth to your promises
Washed away before the war began
If there's still a chance
Tell me now
(Repeat Chorus)
Maybe it's true nothing lasts forever
So they say
So sad
Baby without your love
No sun would rise again
But girl these open arms are
Gettin' tired
And pretty soon I'm gonna
Walk away
No you don't feel the pain
Baby you're the lucky one
And don't think I'll be waitin'
Round
While you treat my love
Like it's all a dime a dozen
Can't you see it girl
You're the lucky one
You're the lucky one
And every day and night
I keep wonderin'
Should I just tear out these

What is the secret to
Keeping your head and your promises? (oh)
I'll mend your broken heart (she said)
Under one condition
If I lift you up, you'll never let me down
Darling under one condition

Wondering why the night
Isn't telling her: believe him
If he could only read to her the pages of his heart
She could see they feel the
Same
Learning the secret to
Keeping their heads and their promises (oh)
I'll mend your broken heart (he said)

1284,Winger,Who's The One,"--------------------
When all the colors begin to fade
And the imitations turn to grey
When the Iron Man begins to rust
And the Holy Water turns to dust
What will be your savior now
Dragon or machine
Who will wear the crown of thorns
In Mother Nature's dream
Who's the one
Who claimed my liberty
Robbed my soul of freedom
How long must I put up with the
Unholy sound of your gun
Tell me, brother
When believers start to lose the faith
And the naked army falls from grace
When all extremes return to one
See them melt into the setting sun
The bounty on the rebel's heart
Washed away the pride
Drove the voice a million miles
Across the great divide
Who's the one
Who claimed my liberty
Robbed my soul of freedom
Who's the one
Who denied my eyes to see
Truth behind double tongue
Who's the one
Who claimed my liberty
Robbed my soul of freedom
How long must I put up with the
Unholy sound of your gun
Tell me, brother
The bounty on the rebel's heart
Washed away the pride
Drove the voice a million miles
Across the great divide
Who's the one
Who claimed my libery
Robbed my soul of freedom
Who's the one

Keeps you in the dark
You're staring at the window all alone
You keep yourself apart
From everything you long for
Could you walk away from everything you've known
And don't look back
Right or wrong, it's your release so
Don't give up
Find the love to finally find your way out
Of the life that let you
Life that let you down
Would you dare open your heart?
Would you dare come out of the dark?
Who'll be there to catch your fall?
Someone there to see it all
If you're there then I'll be there
You see the sun go down
The emptyness around you
You only know the war inside your head
You beg to hear a sound
And not the world around you
You only hear the echo of regret
And don't be afraid
Right or wrong, you'll always have your
Right to change
Find the strength to finally find your Way out
Of the loneliness
Loneliness inside you
Would you dare open your heart?
Would you dare come out of the dark?
Who'll be there to catch your fall?
Someone there to see it all
Who'll be there to honor your life
If you're there then I'll be there
Would you dare open your heart?
Would you dare come out of the dark?

Watching these words but until that day...
