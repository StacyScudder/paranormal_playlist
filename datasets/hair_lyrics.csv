0,Cinderella,All Comes Down,"Everybody thinks it's so easy
Everybody thinks it's so fine
But everytime I get a little closer to the top
I find myself at the end of the line

You take a slow ride up
And a fast one down
Nothin's gonna stop you spinnin' round and round and round

Everybody's talkin' at me
But nothin's soundin' right
They say my future's lookin' brighter
But I don't see no light
I got a bottle of hurricane
It gets me high as a kite
Now the rain's pissin' down
And the storm is in sight
When the shit hits the fan
You gotta stick to the fight

Everybody says the world owes me
Everybody wants a free ride
Well let me tell ya mister
If you never raise a blister
Then you might as well have laid down and died

'Cause you ain't gettin' out what you don't put in
You're never gonna make it if your head is in a spin

1,Cinderella,Back Home Again,"I hit the road wide open at seventeen
Mama cried herself to sleep
Lost a dad I'd never seen
Took all my childhood friends
Guitar, and a dream
Some say I got it bad
I say I've got the cream

No, no, no
I roll into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black
Go, go, go
I hit the stage and you make me feel like I'm back

I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home

I worked from nine to five at twenty-two
Felt good to stay alive
Good times were far and few

Trustin' my hopes and dreams
With someone who said they knew
Just how to make ends meet
They haven't got a clue

No, no, no
I rolled into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black
Go, go, go
I hit the stage and you make me feel like I'm back

I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home
Take me back

2,Cinderella,Bad Attitude Shuffle,"When I get up in the morning
Got a world of trouble on my mind
And nothin' seems too easy
When your clock's tickin' quarter to five
Make my way down to the door
Can't put my troubles on no shelf
Cause when nobody worries for you
You got to worry for yourself

Cruisin' in my four wheels
It's got everything I need inside
Think I'll stop and fill it up for the ride
Man said that be twenty dollars
Mister, by the way how's your health
I said mister here's your money
Now you keep your questions for yourself

And it's my life that I'm livin'
Wouldn't want to be no one else
So if you don't like how I dot it
Ya better keep it to yourself
Kick it in
When I get up in the morning
Got a world of trouble on my mind
And nothin' seems too easy

3,Cinderella,Blood from a Stone,"Well I've been walkin'
Down a one way dirty street
Tryin' to find the answers
And I've been hopin'
For a chance to meet
The rat that spread the cancer

And the lies they've been spinnin'
And the smiles they've been grinnin'
There has sure been some sinnin'

But my heart's not sinkin'

From the love they've been buyin'
And the blues they've been cryin'
Now the time keeps a flyin'
But nobody's tryin'
Cause the love of the money
Didn't turn out so sunny
When the well's dry
No one comes around

Boys lookin' pretty
Now he's lookin' like a pity
Cut the flesh down to the bone
But you can't get
You can't get from a stone

You can try
But I still got the fight in my eyes
Suck it dry
Cause I've had about enough of your lies

5,Cinderella,Dead Man's Road,"When I was young, old man sat me on his knee

He said whoa, watch out boy 
Don't go messing with your life cause it ain't no toy
Lord help ya to carry life's load
It could all pass you by down on dead man's road

I can't make you feel what you felt so long ago
I'll let it show
I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all that's left are the words
I can't let go
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really want to go

[Chorus]
Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long

I can't feel the things that cause you pain
I can't clear my heart of your love it falls like rain
Ain't the same
I hear you calling far away
Tearing through my soul I just can't take another day
Who's to blame
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time let me know
If you really wanna go

[Chorus]

Do you wanna see me beggin' baby
Can't you give me just one more day
Can't you see my heart's been draggin' lately
I've been lookin' for the words to say

7,Cinderella,"Easy Come, Easy Go","I¹m running free

Forget the past
Cause it¹s the only way to ease my mind
Some fortune telling lady
With her face a little crazy
Stared straight into my eyes
She said I¹d love to help you son
But this one you can¹t out run
I sure as hell
Can give it a try
Cause it¹s easy come
And it¹s easy go
Don¹t go crying on my shoulder
Cause I won and Lost
More than you could know
I always find a way
To make it through another day
Cause when all you got¹s
Your pride
Ain¹t nobody gonna take it away
Take it one breath at a time

I¹ll be doin just fine
When tomorrow¹s out of sight and out of mind
Cause it¹s easy come
And easy go
Don¹t go cryin on my shoulder

And if the world should stop turnin'
Our love would be alive

There's nothing I can say
Nothing I can do

Everytime I'd have a fall

Wondering could I be as strong
Could I give as much to someone else
As you gave to your son

When we didn't see eye to eye
By and by we do some growing up

Its a one way ride
Baby's had enough of lookin'

In from the outside
In from the outside
In from the outside

Beaten every step of the way
Lived by the glass
And got a little ass
Three or four times a day

Well you can't take it with you
Its a one way ride
Baby's had enough of lookin'

In from the outside
In from the outside

Looking for sympathy
You just keep on walkin'

21,Cinderella,Make Your Own Way,"Born and raised in a one dog town
That never took a chance or a dare
The times kept a changin' but it all passed 'em by
The prejudices in the air
Drove me to cocaine eyes by the age of one five
Kept my momma walking the floor
But I had to draw the line for the very last time
She kicked my ass out the door

It ain't always easy when you're living hand to mouth
The more you put in, the less you get out
It ain't always easy when you're living day to day
It ain't always easy when you're tryin' to make your own way

Make your own way
When life's a little hard on you
Make your own way
Nobody's gonna die for you

I remember rollin' dice on the run
Looking for a winning hand
We never stop to wonder at the wonders passing by
Just searchin' for the promised land
We met a mean old man
Who dealt a dirty hand
Promised we could touch the sky
But the devil's his friend
He put the pen in my hand
Said you can pay me back after you die

It ain't always easy when you're living hand to mouth
The more you put in, the less you get out
It ain't always easy when you're living day to day
It ain't always easy when you're tryin' to make your own way

Make your own way
When life's a little hard on you
Make your own way
Nobody's gonna die for you

Ah, ah, ah sometimes you gotta walk the straight line
Ah, ah, ah feel like I'm just doing time

Ooo, when life gets a little hard
You gotta gotta ooo make your own way
Sometimes you gotta make your own way
Here we go

Ooo, sing it for 'em now, yeah
Make your own way
When life's a little hard on you
Make your own way
Ain't nobody gonna die for you

24,Cinderella,Nothin' for Nothin',"When you see your face in the mirror
Does it seem the end is gettin' nearer
All your life you spent as a wheeler
Now the hole you dug, it's gettin' deeper

You're talkin' words
But they don't make the rhyme
You'll lose it all
'Cause you can't draw the line

You got nothin'
(Nothin' for nothin')
You're hurtin' over time
(Nothin' for nothin')
And we don't need your time
(Nothin' for nothin')
Pushin', shovin', got no time
(Nothin' for nothin')

When you see the day gettin' darker
You can run to your lies, run to your cover
When you feel the heat from a lover
You hit the highway lookin' for another

You made the grade
You left the hills behind
You take the cake and eat it
You're so blind

You got nothin'
(Nothin' for nothin')
You're hurtin' over time
(Nothin' for nothin')
And we don't need your time
(Nothin' for nothin')
Pushin', shovin', got no time

26,Cinderella,One for Rock and Roll,"I was born on the dawn of a new society
And I feel lucky that my eyes could see
People standing up and being
Who they want to be
People made the music
And the music may them free

Now I was just a baby through
The summer of love they say
But it still feels like it was yesterday
And if the road gets rough
I pick up my guitar and play

It's always been right by my side
To help me on my way

[Chorus]
Now I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
Ain't anticipating what's to come
And I don't need to worry 'bout
The things I have not done
Long as I got rock and roll
I'm forever young

Now we can't always understand this world
Farther along we'll understand it all
The '70s looked like we all
Were headed for a fall
But those who listened hard enough
Could hear the summer call

Now I was growing up through all of this
My first beer and love and my first kiss
You never learn the things in school
You learn by living and going through
You taught me to be myself
How can I thank you

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Ain't it truth!"

30,Cinderella,Sick for the Cure,"There used to be a time when I thought I had the answers
Answers to the questions that nobody knew
Used to be a time when I had some time
But when I had the time, I didn't know what to do

Wasted all those years never gettin? any younger
Times kept a changin? but I still got the hunger
Only trouble is the walls are closing in
Sometimes I want to give it all away

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

Maybe I?ll head down south to New Orleans
Wouldn't have no taxes ?cause I wouldn't have no means
Lookin' for a Genie that could fill my dreams
But dreams become reality and real ain't what it seems to be

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

Sick for the cure on this roller coaster ride
It can take you real low and it can get you real high
Just passin? time
But time ain't on our side
Ah, guitar

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again, alright

They said you're only gettin' older
But how was I to know then
That they'd be cryin' on my shoulder

Put your money in a big house
Get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
When she connects you with a knife

Somebody get the doctor
I'm feelin' pretty poor
Somebody get the stretcher
Before I hit the floor

Somebody save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me
Save me

Everybody's got opinions
But nobody's got the answers
And that shit you ate for breakfast
Well it'll only give you cancer

We're runnin' in a circle
Runnin' to the morning light
And if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night

Somebody get the doctor
I think i'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
Because i ain't got the cash

Somebody save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me
Save me
Look out

Save me

Eighteen years I'm a rebel
Thinkin' I'm pretty tough
Daddy said you got a lot to learn
I thought that I'd learned enough

But I was wrong
Ooh I was wrong, yeah

Twenty-five was a good time
Comin' into my own
Climbed the mountain and I reached for the sky
I thought that I had it all

But I was wrong
Ooh I was wrong

The road's still long

When you get where you're going

'Cause the best things that you learn you find out on your way
No time for feelin' sorry just time for being strong

When you get where your going
The road's still long

Now I see where I come from
Now I see where I am
Now I see that you never really know
So you just gotta do the best you can

39,Cinderella,War Stories,"Pull on up
To the soapbox stool
Let me tell ya some stories
About how life can be cruel

But they turned to dust
I need another shot of oil
'Cause it's starting to rust

And I'm tryin' to make a living
Tryin' to find my way

To be somebody someday

Tryin' to get ahead
Shootin' at the moon
But it shot me down instead

Through those war stories
Everybody's got 'em, when you hit the bottom and survive

I said have another drink
This one's on me
Let me tell ya 'bout pain from A to Z
I got scars from my head to my feet
Some like a junkyard car still rolling down the streets

And I'm tryin' to make a dollar
Tryin' to pay my way
I've been bustin' my balls
And then they take it all away
Tryin' to climb the ladder
Reaching for the sky
I ain't going down
Until they hang me out to dry

But the strong keep stickin' it out

The sea can touch the sky at night
It's got the freedom I crave

I'm going through changes in my life
I'm going through changes
It'll be alright

Look into a picture
A thousand years are told
Now is it any wonder
What our tomorrows hold

Our yesterdays are over
You know they go so fast
If I could rule the winds of change
You know I'd make it all last

I'm going through changes in my life
I'm going through changes
It'll be alright
Alright

I walked alone through the blackest night
I felt the cold, I felt the bite
I took the high road but it ain't right
It's just the low road in disguise

I'm going through changes
Ah yea
Everything's gonna be alright, yea

Got to the top of an uphill climb
Only to look down the other side
Just when you think it's on your side
This world will show you ain't no reason to the rhyme

Seems like everything's falling down

Watch out now cause a good times heading our way

All that we've seen
A never ending wheel
It goes on and on and on

All alone all by myself
In this room now full of fears
Something's calling out haunting me
It's all starting to come clear
Motionless I cannot run
Magnetizing draws me near
Hypnotizing in slow motion
Is this reality right here

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me

Rememberin' how it wasn't pretty
Every day life in the city
Out in the street we had to take it
With friends around, couldn't it
What wasn't there, we had to make it
Hangin' out down in the city

The hard times are dead and gone
But the hard times have made me strong
And the hard times have made me see
That the hard times ain't where I wanna be

We had to fight to be accepted
It wasn't right and I protested
For hangin' out we got arrested
Every day life in the city

We'd go to school and then we'd cut out
Go to the park and space our heads out
We called it fun but there was some doubt
Hangin' out down in the city

The hard times are dead and gone
But the hard times have made me strong
And the hard times have made me see
That the hard times ain't where I wanna be

I don't wanna be there or even think back
I don't wanna be there, now I'm on the right track, yeah

Worked in a band who had no name at all

They called the family doctor to see what he could do
Doc said ""No you can't cure his soul
Once he's infected with the blues""
So I travelled 'round from town to town singin' out the news

I was vaccinated with a little needle
And I'm hooked on rock and roll

To work from nine to five
Find the back beat, set your heart free
And feel that music runnin' through your feet

And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

So I went to the table and reached for a bottle

I was wiped out, I had my lights out
Was fallin' right out, 'cos I was wiped out
Through the smoke-filled room I caught your eye
And I think that you caught mine

Then you started to move with such a groove, stronger than sneakin' slow
Then you looked at me with your big blue eyes, they had such a glow
Then I took your hand and tried to stand and ended up sittin' back down

So I looked at you and then I knew that we were gonna have some fun
So I thought to myself, wine was out, we should switch to rum
So without a word, and like some bird, we flew to another place
And pretty soon we were in some room stretched miles out in space
The room was turnin', we were burnin', things became a haze
It seemed that already I had too many, firewater caused the blaze, I was

I was wiped out, I had my lights out

Five bottles later
Holocaust in the roxy



You're lovin' your lady


I can see

I can see
Burning bones of war



Ashes on the floor


There stands a soldier
In a barbed-wire land


The fear of death in his eyes

And a bottle in his hand

But, now the wine he's drinking

It's got the taste of blood

No more plastic war movies

To show him what it's like



I can see

Burning bones of war

Ashes on the floor

No hope, no faith, no luck

No family, no cash
No church and no religion

Everywhere around the world

Rock is still alive

You get together with your best friends


On a magical drive


Crank up the sound, turn it up loud

Shout, let your feelings out
Fasten your seatbelts, light up the smoke

Would want to leave this world behind

Too many puzzles here to solve
Human beings fight to evolve
A simple answer within reach
It's in your heart, don't make me preach 'cause

Everyone is looking to America
Where the birds of freedom
Spread their wings up high
Everyone is looking to America
Reachin' out to heaven for a sign

You know the whole wide world
Is going through a big change
For better or for worse?
The question still remains

Unemployment shooting high
Immigration on the rise
Cities overflowing with people
Lookin' at a dead end!

It never was too easy to rule
Long term solutions need more time

A battle-film and some booze
Ain't got no time for ecology

I'll be out of your life

Long crazy nights spilling into days
Times when I lost my fears

187,Krokus,Throwing Her China,"I saw her walkin' down the street
My heart jumped up and missed a beat
Boy, she looked sharper than an arrow
Her skirt too short and really narrow

No risk, no gain
But I must have made a pass too plain
Her hand came flyin' and it really was a shame

Well, I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop
Yes, I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top

Next day I saw her in the park
If I was a dog I would have barked
In a pink bikini by the lake
Her perfect body lay to bake

No risk, no pain
And I must have blocked her sun away
Cold ice came flyin' and it landed on my face

Well, I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop
Yes, I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top

Lyin' in the sunshine by the lake
This girl is givin' me a heartache

No risk, no gain
I'm runnin' out of cards to play
Another time, another place
I just gotta win the race

Well, I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop
Yes, I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top

Well, I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop
I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top

Watch out, there she blows
Yes, I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top

188,Krokus,Tokyo Nights,"Last night when I was laying in my bed 
Had a dream of a flag in white & red 
Swiss cross turned into the japan dot 
A yellow girl appeared and made me hot

She took me to her place - a Geisha house 
There was tea rice-booze & ceremony 
I got undressed she had me washed 
I felt her body and I was lost

Tokyo nights hot burning lights 
Tokyo nights you took my mind away 
Made me obsessed by loving fights

Soon I remembered I stayed in a dream 
And I could make a try to change the scene 
The geisha girl was just too hot for me 
I tried to wake up unsuccessfully

And even as the big alarm-clock rang 
Outside my window the first blackbird sang 
My yellow girlfriend didn't leave my head 
Got to stay forever in her bed

Tokyo nights hot burning lights 
Tokyo nights you took my mind away 
I'm in the spell of your delights

189,Krokus,We'll Rise,"Dark was the night
Tears on my face
We gathered in the candlelight
As the whole world stood still

How can I forget that prayer for the dead
Underneath that blackened sky
As close as we could get

It's the age we're livin' in
A dark sign of the times
Can't let the madness
Kick us down to the ground

We'll rise, we'll rise
We'll shine in the night
We'll rise, we'll shine
From the ashes of eternity

We'll rise, we'll rise
We'll shine in the night
We'll rise, we'll shine to eternity

Another starry sky
Another silver moon
And soon the sun will shine
Warming our roofs

Gather your children
We must move with the wind
To make a fire bright
From the flames within

We'll rise, we'll rise
Like an eagle flies in the sky
'cause together we're strong
And we'll rise, we'll rise

190,Krokus,Winning Man,"I've been waiting for so long.
Hand in hand treating wrong.
Sleepless night and dirty lies.
Makes no different if you live or die.

But it's over now.
Just life, I'm winning man.

But it's over now.
Just life, I'm winning man.

I live my life the way I choose.
Satisfy not much to loose.
If you don't feel you'll never know.

Just what I've been going through for so long.

But it's over now.
Just life, I'm winning man.

But it's over now.
Just life, I'm winning man.

Will tomorrow bring you back again?

Lost in space or any other place
Living my dream on the moving train
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow, yeah
I remember way back when, I was just like you
Yeah, I killed myself to live,
But I didn't have a clue
I got saddled in chrome and steel
750 reasons why I can't stand still
Oh no, here I go
Gotta keep moving, gotta let go
'Nother town, 'nother girl
Can't stand still till I've seen the world
Till I've seen the world, when I cry
Get in my spaceship, watch me fly
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow, yeah, ooh, ah
Don't need no one to tell me to settle down
Life in the fast lane suits me to the ground
This is my destiny, the way that I choose
Don't need no one to tell me

Tension rising no surrender
The street's a place where love is dying
All hail to thee thy legal tender

At night the vipers rip my flesh
The bitch from hell is feeding
Scratch my wounds to keep them fresh

She likes 'em young 'n' bloody

Good and hate fear and shame
Wasted our disaster

Cuts like cancer in my brain

A place of such enchantment
Words could never say
A world of mystery pleasures undenied
Come to this place of mine
And walk close by my side

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Sail away
Wishing well cast a spell
And let's away

Come to a place that's hidden
Just beyond the skies
No need to ask me if this
Love will ever die
No past regret no future near
Shall make you slave
I will be true to you
From far beyond the grave

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And fade away
Shed the coil
No need to toil
Come far away

Pale crimson lips abound
With eyes of coral blue
A bed of rose and sage these things
I give to you
And woe betide the one who doubts
And loses heart
Come let's away and we shall never part
Never part
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And fade away
Wishing well cast a spell
And let's away

Locked inside your mind

Confronted and confined
Your candle slowly fading
Turning light and life to dust
For memory and things to be are false
Without true trust
Your needle isn't sharp enough
To puncture through my vein
Your false Gods aren't real enough
To even scratch my soul
You think you're clutching diamonds
When all you really have is coal
My feet are bleeding again

Dykes and fairies
Tell me where is sanity?

Tax the rich
Feed the poor
Till there are no rich no more?

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

Population keeps on breeding
Nation bleeding
Still more feeding, economy

Life is funny, skies are sunny
Bees make honey
Who needs money? Monopoly

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

World pollution
There's no solution
Institution, electrocution

Just black and white
Rich or poor
Them and us
Stop the war

Searching for heaven, it wasn't there

It's all about fame
We're blind just the same
Watching our children go insane

I can hear the screams echo in the streets
It's a baby gone drive by

My city is feeling worthless and weak, their
Wasted

Dying on the streets

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Sometimes it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger, and stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in your warm and darkend grave?

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?  No I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?  No I'll never feel the same

I know I've been so hard on you; I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish, I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

Walk with me in the twilight
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Cause there's no one like you
So don't let me down tonight

Flames shines bright in my eyes
It only shines when I look at you
It leaves me with just a smile

Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me"

Come a little closer, so I can look you in your eyes
So I can see what I been missing, so I can see through the disguise
You're dressed to kill

You got me in the sight of your gun, you're dressed to kill

Sell your soul to rock and roll
The only thing that thrills you
Evil grins as night begins
Gonna rock until it kills you
Learn to live fast
Learn to die young
Life's one big chase
You're caught in the race
You're never gonna slow down

You're dressed to kill
Kill me baby
You're never gonna let go
You're dressed to kill
You kill me baby
You're dressed to kill

Wake the dead with loud guitars
Screamin' in your head
An angel sings, fulfills the dreams
That are dancin' in your bed
Live for the danger
Die for the fun
Life's one big chase
You're caught in the race
You're never gonna slow down

299,Lita Ford,Fall,"Words are spoken, swallowed in vain 
Slowly, I'm choking 
I cough it up, cough it up, cough it up again 
Familiar, familiar 
Laughing, laughing at the man who 
Never had a chance to dream your dreams 
Find it funny here today, you know 
But, if by tomorrow, you might wonder then 
Why your seeds are weeds 
Familiar, familiar 
Familiar, is it familiar? 

[Chorus]
Open up - There's a river in us all 
Open up - From the cradle where we crawl 
Open up - It's so unusual 
Open up - Cause sitting on the wall 

Everybody's got to fall 
Oh, show me, show me a reason 
A reason for, anything I see 
Round and round and round and round, we go 
What happened to my brother? 
Will his flowers wither? 
Just like me, yeah 
Familiar, familiar 
Familiar, is it familiar? 

[Chorus]

I am no preacher, I know no teachings 
Sway my mind, dear with your primal screeching 
Buried under, your plastic cover 
You are me, and I am you

300,Lita Ford,Falling in and Out of Love,"We've changed, a new change of season 
Autumn came, we went, I went insane 
Never was winter so cold, no 
Look away from the homeward road 
I'm feeling love in a daydream 
Making love first morning light 
Walking slowly in the summer rain 
Alone I lie, fantasize 
I'm falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
Slip inside my dream 
Dream away with me 
'Cause I'm falling in and out of love 
Like a diamond, never our love would break 
But in a heartbeat thrown us both away 
Set me free to live my life like a rolling stone 
Look away from the homeward road 
I'm feeling love in a daydream 
Making love first morning light 
Walking slowly in the summer rain 
Alone I lie, fantasize 
Falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
Slip inside my dream 
Dream away with me 
'Cause I'm falling in love 
Falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love 
I'm falling in and out of love

But you were the bitch babe 
I guess you'd call it a fatal passion 
You try to pull my trigger, always leading my on 
Makin' up your own rules, I was always the clown 
Times must change now, you'll see it my way 
I just can't take it 
What you don't know, I must say 
I guess we both had a lot to learn, 
Uh, huh 
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned 
Don't call me insane, 'cause that's not my game 
Turn your head, you're dead 
From a fatal passion 
Cross your heart and hope you survive 
Fatal passion 
You're like a broken picture 
A mirrored image I can't see 
You tried to lock me up 
And you swallowed the key 
My mind's been twisted 
Time my wounds must heal 
Lookin' back in anger 
Now you know just how I feel 
But tell me where do you draw the line, 
Uh, huh 
It's time that you realize 
Don't call me insane, 
'Cause that's not my game 
Turn your head, you're dead 
You try to pull my trigger, always leading my on 
Makin' up your own rules, I was always the clown

Now the poisons in his memory 
Are clogging up his veins 
And the loneliness like a devil's kiss 
Has gone straight to his brain

336,Lita Ford,War of the Angels,"She runs through the streets
So desperately young
Her eyes aflame
And her mind undone
She aches for the songs
That will never be sung
And the heroes so quickly forgotten

She sees a friend
In the church yard light
Laughin' and jokin'
And talkin' to the sky
Shots ring out
And he hits the ground
He never opens his eyes
And she cries

Heaven is closed to the angels below
Streets of gold are now paved with sorrow
God only knows what happens to love
When the innocence is gone
And the war of the angels has begun

The ghosts in her head
Have faces and names
They're soldiers and children
All one in the same
In the streets and the alleys
Hear the battle cries sound
And the angels run for cover
As the world comes tumbling down

All through the night the battle is fought
They can never win back the lives they've lost
Down on her knees, in the tear stained dawn
She just closes her eyes and whispers goodbye

Heaven is closed to the angels below
Streets of gold are now paved with sorrow
God only knows what happens to love
When the innocence is gone
And the war of the angels is never won

Another day in the neighborhood
Better dry your eyes and be off to school
She packs her lunch and her daddy's gun
Seems much too old to be so young

The battle begins the day that you're born
Into this world, so heartsick and war torn
Somebody better come and carry her away
Maybe this angel will live
To fly again someday

Heaven is closed to the angels below
Streets of gold are now paved with sorrow
God only knows what happens to love
When the innocence is gone
And the war of the angels rages on
Rages on
Oh, yeah, yeah"
337,Lita Ford,What Do Ya Know About Love,"You walk tall, you act proud
Leave the little girls cryin' out loud

When it comes to love, babe you're outta luck
Yeah, I know I'm a fool
Tryin' to find a way to get next to you

I want to tie myself to your bed of fire
But you'll only cut me loose once you had enough

Tell me, what do you know about love?
Spreadin' yourself all over town
What do you know about love?
There's a lot more to it than lyin' down

Your mind's tickin', your heart stop
Your eyes are ice cold, your lips are red hot
Little lies that you do
Whispered like an Angel straight from Hell
Live wire, short fuse
Walkin' detonator in snakeskin boots

You're a bad mistake but I can't wait to make you
I'm gonna shake you from your sleepwalk in the dark

Hey, what do you know about love?
With your dirty mind and your heart of stone
What do you know about love?
You got a lot of friends but you're all alone
How can you run from the truth?
Spreadin' yourself all over town
What do you know about love?
There's a lot more to it than lyin' down

The day will come, you take a long hard look in the mirror
And your pretty face starts to look a little rough

How can you run from the truth?

338,Lita Ford,Where Will I Find My Heart Tonight,"I found hunger in the fields of plenty
I found freedom in a ball and chain
I found madness in the voice of reason
I found mercy at the hangman's gate

I've held the world in the palm of my hand
And watched as it slipped through my fingers like sand
Here I am alone again

Where do I turn
When all I see around me is a lie?
If I close my eyes
Where will I find my heart tonight?
I know all my dreams have fallen on hard times
And I'm so cold inside
Where will I find my heart tonight?

I found peace in the heat of the battle
I found treason in the eyes of a friend
I found hate in the words of a preacher
I found fortune in a beggar's hands

I close my eyes and pray for the light
To guide my way
Into the night, I fall
And the world is crashin' down around my soul

Why do I turn
When all I see around me is a lie?
If I close my eyes
Where will I find my heart tonight?
I know all my dreams have fallen on hard times
And I'm so cold inside
Where will I find my heart tonight?

I have searched a thousand years
Through the darkness and the tears
And I don't think I can take another night
Without you here

Where do I turn
When all I see around me is a lie?
If I close my eyes
Where will I find my heart tonight?
I know all my dreams have fallen on hard times
And I'm so cold inside
Where will I find my heart tonight?

Where will I find my heart tonight?"
339,Lita Ford,White Lightnin',"I was born to a gypsy woman
With lightnin' crashing all around my crib
Doctor took one look, he started runnin'
He got two steps an' lightnin' struck him dead
The wind was howlin' like the devil come knockin'
The house came down, the cradle was rockin'

He called out for a hoodoo man
With a rock 'n' roll attitude
He made a sign with his mo-jo hand
And the lightnin' done struck him blue
I jumped out of that cradle
Grabbed a black cat bone and said
""Mama, don't you worry, I was born to storm.""

When lightnin' strikes and the walls fall down
I'm a wild cat, baby, when the thunder sounds
When lightnin' strikes, white lightnin'

And double or nothin'
Baby, pull my switch
I got a six string hammer
Gonna scratch this itch
I'm a white witch, honey
With long blonde hair
Won't you step into my 'lectric chair

When lightnin' strikes and the walls fall down
I'm a wild cat, baby, when the thunder sounds

Why won't she see me,
She's not looking well,
Some girls just like to push their luck..
Until they wind up.. DOA, DOA, DOA

I paid a visit to a Dr.J,
He thought it might have been her chromosome,
So he put blue jeans in her DNA,
I guess that's why she's not coming home,
Spend all my money on her luxuries,
I guess I'll need a bigger salary,
Her lonely life is such a mystery,
I keep her picture in my gallery, ya!

When you're in my arms, I find all that I need
I could never live without the heaven that you showed me

I've been waiting all my life, just to look into your eyes
Only for the time alone with you
And when I climb the stairs to find you, and we reach for the light
I thank God I've got this time alone with you

Your kiss can captivate me, and your touch can set me free
I count the hours, baby, till you are next to me
And it's taken such a long time, to find someone that understands
When I reach out for love now, I reach out for your hand

When I feel your heart beat, it makes me come alive
I don't want to live without something that is so right

I've been waiting all my life, just to look into your eyes
Only for the time alone with you

And touch your golden hair
You turned around and looked at me
And paradise was there

Yesterday
Time stood still
As we walked into the night together
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
It seems just like yesterday
Time stood still
We found a little seaside bar
High above the rocks
You were drinking white wine
And I was doing shots
I wondered if you'd stay the night
You just took my hand and led the way
Time stood still
As we made love through the night together
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
Time stood still
Time stood still
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
Oh yeah
I thought that I'd seen love before
But what you showed me
Well that's something more
Love found two strangers walking on the shore
We threw our watches in the sea
I looked at you you looked at me
And time stood still
We made a fire on the beach that night
And watched the seagulls circle in the morning light
Maybe there are some things
We're not meant to understand Anyway
Time stood still
But love goes on forever
The memory is burned in our hearts forever
Oh yes
Time stood still
The moment's gone forever
But I will love you till
Time stands still in our hearts forever

Girl these rumors are drivin' me mad

All my good friends turn their face to the wall
When they see me, what the hell's goin' on am I so blind
That I can't see when I'm being had

I know it's silly but girl I really thought we had a chance
I must've been crazy!

Bang Bang, what's that sound
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang Bang, you're so cool
Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang! Bang!

Girl you told me you were not like the rest
Then you showed me now you're failing the test
It was easy just an urge in the heat of the nite

I believed you, now that's all in the past
'Cause I made some mistakes but I'm learnin' fast
Never put your heart on the line!
Never put your heart on the line!

I know it's silly but girl I really thought we had a chance
I must've been crazy!

Bang Bang, what's that sound
I gave you my love and you shot me down

Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang! Bang!"
453,Danger Danger,Comin' Home,"Spent half of my life
On the run
From tired love
And endless heartache
I feel like I'm ready for a change

And I made some mistakes
In the past
Even some
I've learned to live with
But I'm so tired of runnin' away

I was down and out
And I had my doubts
hTat we'd ever meet again
I was so confused
I had nothin to lose
But you
And that's the last thing I wanted

I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home

Just like the rodeo
A lonesome cowboy
Without a home
Driftin' like tumbleweed
I blew from town to town

So many promises
I had to make
But I could never keep
I will be there for you
When all the bets are down

When you're down and out
And you have your doubts
I'll be there to make you smile
You can count on me
""Cuz I'd do anything for you, yeah!
Baby hold on!

I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home "

And I've learned to live without ya

Now when it rains it pours
I'm all alone, but I'll always be yours
If you take me by the hand
Open up your heart
I'll help you find your way back home
Have a little faith
Don't give up on love
I""ll help you find your way back home
Let me prove to you, how much you mean to me
I'd climb the highest mountain, swim the deepest sea
I'd do it all for you...give me one more chance

I'm all alone, but I'll always, always be yours

Tryin' hard to forget you 
But I just can't let you go

No matter where you go 
Just as sure as a cold wind blows 
I still think about you 
Do you think about me? 

Baby, I remember when 
You and me were best of friends 
We crossed our hearts and swore it lasts forever 

But I guess that lovin' me 
Was just a temporary thing 
And I wish to God that we were still together 

I hope you found what you were looking for 
It's been 3 years, a lot of tears 
Ain't got nothing but this song 

I still think about you 
Do you think about me? 
I still think about you 

No matter where you go 
Just as sure as a cold wind blows 
I still think about you 
Do you think about me? 

When you're all alone 
When you need a friend 
I guess it doesn't matter 
'Cause what we had we'll never have again 

Lyin' all alone in bed 
Crazy thoughts running through my head 
Thinkin' about you 

I still think about you 
Do you think about me?

459,Danger Danger,Under the Gun,"Lost in the shuffle the hustle and bustle of the city
Just a sweet young girl in a knockdown world, such a pity
Well she never worried, growin' up in a hurry
No one showed her the right
She met a man, he took her hand one night

Out on the street all the people you meet
Wanna use you for your innocent ways
Running around you're the talk of the town today

You were so cool you played by the rules
You thought you had it in the palm of your hand
You're on your way to the top and
They won't let you stop till you're there

Now you're under the gun out on the run
Paying the price with your flesh and your blood
It's bringing you down, bringing you down
Livin' your life under the gun

Under the lights, you're feelin' the bite
Of big city days and big city nights
Now you're alone, you wanna go home, but you can't

You're goin' out of your head, they're in and out of your bed
You're losin' sight of what you thought was the truth
They'll string you along till you're tattered and torn
Then along comes somebody new

When you're under the gun out on the run
Paying the price with your flesh and your blood
It’s bringing you down, bringing you down
Livin' your life under the gun

You were on the top but now
You're runnin' out of time
Open your eyes
Now you're under the gun
Under the gun

Under the gun, out on the run
Paying the price with your flesh and your blood
It's bringing you down, bringing you down
Livin' your life under the gun

Under the gun, out on the run
Paying the price with your flesh and your blood

Behind these private eyes
The truth would look so easy now
But I'm running out of lies

Now the damage is done

Danger (such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?

Oh he was locked inside a room without a door
His innocence he suffered for
In a world of black and white, they were wrong and he was right

He's going underground to track that danger down
Oh Billy, and why you got that gun?

Like a sheep in a lion's den
Gonna fall but you won't know when

It's gonna get you
You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall
And the ghostly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall
Then a scream rang out like thunder, but the lightning was too late

As the rain came down on the crimson ground
It was the hand of fate
And a crowd of people gathered 'round, but Billy couldn't wait

Ringing loud and long

Is the king of pain
A lost horizon
In an ocean of flames

Only the lonely will stand

Have crumbled to the ground

Are nowhere to be found

Time is the essence the priests do say
To restore your faith in man

Protected by our swords and shields
We can replant the seed

The roads ahead are long and winding
On which the bandits thrive
But we have the power of finding
Illusion to keep us alive
So through the valleys and over the hills
We'll march and sing in rhyme
We'll fight until we lose our will

When you're with me

Temptation, break the vow
Cut flesh from the sacred cow
Unchain the tiger, kiss the flame, feel your desire
Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire

Soaked in fear, the curtain falls
Religion within these walls
Mystify my soul beliefs
Confession is my release

Down to the ground, baby, c'mon
Stand up for love

You couldn't get it much better
You never had it so good
Stand up together
And when your ready to
You're going to get what you should

Little by little like a fine wine
My love is like a motor
Burnin' all the time
Step by step

Easy and slow
On the stairway to heaven
What a way to go
Stand up

Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take a little love and shake it all around
Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground

Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and show me what you found
Stand up

Kick love into motion
My love is like a motor
Burnin' all the time
Stand up

Kick love into motion
Step by step
Go easy, go slow
Stand up, yeah

Stand up
Kick love into motion
Stairway to heaven
What a way to go, stand up"
529,Def Leppard,Tear It Down,"You got the look of a howlin' wolf
I like it
The kind of eyes that could start a fire

A streetwise dynamo, I switch you on
And I watch you go
A thrill to touch, you're so hot
I'm coming for you ready or not

Tear it down

If only you could stay
All night long

I'm on fire, you're all ice
Once too much is twice as nice
Get tough, fools luck
One bite and I'm hooked
A black cat with a silver tongue
A quick lick and you're gone
One kiss, it hots up
Too close ain't close enough

530,Def Leppard,Tonight,"I don't want to play the waiting game
And drift away leavin' an illusion
I don't want to hide, It's foolish pride
To close my eyes a touch away from wantin' you

Don't try to look away when you're face to face
I see your eyes that animal emotion
You don't have to set your tender trap
It's in those eyes, it's gonna happen anyway

(BRIDGE:)
Movin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I'm wantin', willin', touchin' you, we'll be
Movin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Ooh babe, when you get that rhythm
Gonna move into your room

Tonight - Gimme love with no disguise
Tonight - I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight - So right this night could be dynamite
Wait 'n' see, if it pleases you it pleases me

There's nothing I can say, it's no mystery
It's in your eyes, those eyes are where I wanted them
So give me heart 'n' soul, I lose control
Can't stop my eyes from fallin' into fantasy

531,Def Leppard,Too Late for Love,"Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing
And the lady 'cross the street she shuts out the night
There's a cast of thousands waiting
As she turns out the light

But it's too late, too late, too late
(Too late) too late for love
Too late, too late, too late, too late

London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream stands before them all
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall

But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late for love
Too late, too late, it's too late, too late

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you
The actor and the clown they're waiting for their cue
And there's a lady over there she's acting pretty cool
But when it comes to playing life
She always plays the fool

But it's too late, too late, too late, it's too late, too late for love
Too late, it's too late, too late, too late
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a little too late
Oh, oh, oh, oh
That's too late
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Is it all too late

Yeah, it's too late
Too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late

Too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late"

Got my hands on your heart gonna take it all I know, I can't fight this flame

Can't stop the hurt inside when love and hate collide

I don't wanna fight no more I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other baby like an act of war
I could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason and I know
I got a love to believe in all I know got to win this time

Without you, one night alone

537,Def Leppard,When the Walls Came Tumbling Down,"On the first day of the first month in some distant year
The whole sky froze golden
Some said it was the aftermath of the radium bomb
While the others told of a final retribution
A terrible revenge of the Gods
But we understood the grand finale
Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before
So all that was left was

All the women were captured and chained
And national suicide was proclaimed
And new America fell to the ground
And all the children lay crippled lame

But all the nations came together
In fear of the thought of the end
No more would we fight in the streets
No courage had we to defend

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

A blinding light the sun had died a new moon took its place
Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman race
The city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend
A sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the end

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Nobody made a sound

Then He made the water and creatures, then He made man

So he came with the answer, here's what it cost
One part love, one part wild
One part lady, one part child

I give you
(Women, women) lots of pretty women
(Men, men) they can't live without them
(Women, women) lots of pretty women
(Men, men) they can't live without them

And in the garden, lust began
The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And fillin' with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love, one part child
One part lover, one part wild

I give you

One part lover, one part child

A whole lotta something you can't sacrifice

547,Dokken,Can You See,"It's not hard to believe
That the world isn't real
When the sun doesn't shine in your eyes
All the time

It's not hard to concede
As we cry and we bleed everyday
We just won't leave
Feel your heart stop

Still alive but you're not
So you scream that you've had enough
Done enough, said enough

See the reflections of lives that you've changed
As you look in the mirror and try to believe
It's been hard that I know
But I could have told you so you reap what you sow

Can you see in my face
All these tears I saved for you
Can you see it's not right
That our love was never real

Is it right to hold on to the words that we spoke
Even though now that feeling is gone in your eyes
It's been hard to let you go
Even though you found someone new

Everyday
It's been hard to find
With no peace of mind

Can you see in my face
All these tears I saved for you
Can you see it's not right
That our love was never real
"
548,Dokken,Change the World,"Talk to me 'bout fantasy
You talk to me 'bout love
You filled me with empty promises
You promised sky above
You ask me what I'd do for you
Give my life and more
But would it keep you satisfied
Baby I'm not sure
I change myself most everyday
But you don't reply
How can we survive
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't change the world
This timei can't change the world
From soft lips you speak to me
How's it gonna be
Everyday's a different story
Changing all the time
You come to me with promises
I listen as you speak
But the promise that you want the most
Is not for me to keep
You leave me on this withered vine / now
Stripped away and torn
Left with only fantasy
Dreams of nevermore
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
This timei can't change the world
Never said that I held the answers
I can't change the world
I'd give my spirit if you tried
A fortune lost a heart denied
I come to you in your sleep
My heart is yours for only you to keep
And when the days they pass me you will see
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't change the world
This time
I can't change the world
I never said I held the answers
I can't change the world
This time
I can't change the world
Change the world

And she looks pretty good to me
My friends all say that you better watch out
There's a side of her you haven't seen

We were cruising along on her motorbike
Everything was right / til crazy mary went down
So let me tell you about mary
[mary] crazy mary goes round
Let me tell you about mary
[mary] crazy mary goes round and round
Round and round
Called my doctor and I tried to explain
'cause it didn't make sense to me
Seven different sides and I've seen them all
One for everyday of the week
She gave me a scare / she was combing her hair
A long conversation there was nobody there
Does anybody know / what mary's talking about
So let me tell you about mary

Let me tell you about mary

It's my freedom of choice

Don't want to stay 
Its got me reeling

Must be the gypsy 
The cry of the gypsy 
Must be the gypsy 
The cry of the gypsy 
Must be the gypsy in me 

Sometimes, yeah, I feel so alone 
But I don't mind 
As long as you don't close me in 
Everything will be just fine 

Don't tell me about society 
Don't want to hear anymore 
I got my own cross to bear 
And its a heavy load 

Sometimes I feel it 
And I just want to get out 
Must be a reason 
That I just want to shout (Hey) 

Must be the gypsy 
The cry of the gypsy

551,Dokken,Don't Bring Me Down,"I played the fool, it seems a thousand times before
When I got older, thought I've learned my lesson well
Then you came into my life and brought me down
Another lesson towards my fate

I feel like I've been standin' on the sun
Your fire burned my soul like no one's ever done

You can say what you want but don't bring me down
If you want me to play in your garden
Then don't bring me down, baby, if you want my love
Then don't bring me down

Your hyperstatic conversation till the dawn
It makes me tired but I see it turns you on
A tense relationship was all you've ever known
I tried to play but now it cuts me to the bone

I look into your eyes a thousand years away
For my compassion all I got was tears
I feel like I've been standing on the sun
Your fire burned my soul like no one's ever done

If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say

Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool

Callin' my name

555,Dokken,Drown,"I been left in the crossfire / sacrificed to love and hate
Out of ammunition to regain my mental state
I found myself adrift upon an endless sea
Of lies and bitterness / horizon out of reach
I see the starts that shine / reflection in the waves
I need to find that distant shore
Before I drown
Slip beneath the waves and drown
Takes me to my grave
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
That I can save myself before I drown
Too much conversation can erode our little minds
My emancipation comes with solitude at night
As the world sleeps / I contemplate all that's been done
I profess no innocence / I've held - held that smoking gun
I found myself atop a sea of ocean blue
Cast from a world that left me too
To drown
Slip beneath the waves and drown
Takes me to my grave
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
That I can save myself before I drown
I'll drown
Slip beneath the waves and drown
Takes me to my grave
And drown
From the pouring rain
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
I can save myself
Save myself before I drown"

My religion is a mind condition as it turns out
Hesitating while my soul sits waiting through my blackout
Soon the day will come down when I'll reflect on all those years
My perfect world / sublime and surreal
Waiting for the rising sun
Erase the slate
Erase the slate
Erase the slate

Time and time remember when
Life forgave my call
Too much pride / could not repent
Can't escape at all

My future waits outside the door

I make a plea
I'm guilty of feeling
So why is it so hard to see

Chorus
I feel - I feel (crystallized - piece of time)
I feel - I feel
(blood stained eyes - open wide)
I feel
"
571,Dokken,I Surrender,"Leave me here alone
Lying in the burning sun
This world has bleached my bones
I should have taken your advice

Lying all alone
Lost to all my memories
Feeling like a stone
As the sky above me starts to weep

The desert falls
In my mind an endless sea
I will never know
What was and that will never be

Deep within this hole
Flowers lying on my bed
Softly as you speak
Telling me that you've been sad

Leave me here alone
'Cause I won't be coming back again
The moments that we own
Lie scattered in the sand

I surrender, surrender
All my love for you
Please remember, remember babe
I'll be there for you

Leave me here alone
'Cause I won't be coming back again
The moments that we own
Lie broken in the hands of time

I surrender, I surrender
All my love for you
Please remember, remember
I'll be there for you

I surrender, surrender
All my love for you
Please remember, remember babe
I'll be there for you, for you
"
572,Dokken,I Will Remember,"I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one

I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside but we can't be heard

But I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you but more afraid to loose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh, you gave me light

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
Weep not for the memories"
573,Dokken,In My Dreams,"Toss and turn all night in the sheets
I can't sleep
Night after night don't know what it means
In my dreams

What can I say or do
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away

In my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams, you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

Calling your name, but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles, waiting to see you
In my dreams

What can I say or do
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away

In my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams, you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams, you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams, you'll always be
In my heart and in my dreams
In my dreams, it's still the same
In my dreams, you're still by me
In my dreams, just the way it used to be
In my dreams, what can I say
In my dreams, You're still by me
And in my dreams, You'll always be
In my dreams, You'll always be
In my dreams, your love is strong
In my dreams, You're still the same

574,Dokken,In Your Honor,"I lit a candle in your honor today
Prayed for forgiveness for the things that I said
And now I wake up and see I was wrong
All those years wasted / now come and gone
How many years have I been this way
The lines grow deeper / time fades away
Now etched in stone don't have the strength anymore
To break down these walls again
I lit a candle in your honor today
Everything will come around again
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around again
Now I see you on the other side
Sunshine raining down upon your face
You look so beautiful that place where you live
You walk among your dreams we talked about
So I stand here and I stare
In my garden of neglect
Never noticed it before
That it's winter all the time
Was too busy staring at
Your garden that you grew in time
I can see it took a lot of years
Your colors fill my mind
I lit a candle in your honor today
Everything will come around again
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around again
Even though the years keep passing / I reflect
About the one I truly loved and pushed away
Suddenly I stop and feel
That winter rain I know so well
And close my eyes
Wish you all the best
And you never know
I lit a candle in your honor today
Everything will come around
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around
I lit a candle in your honor today
Prayed for forgiveness for the things that I said
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around

575,Dokken,In the Middle,"I talk with you
I think of her
It always turns out the same
I changed my mind
Then I'm not sure
Love's got me shackled in chains

Win or lose
We've lit the fuse
I've lost control
Then you explore my soul

[Chorus]
In the middle
Of love
In the middle
Of love

Torn apart
Right from the start
Is it too late to be true?

Now things have changed
We're not the same
I've lost control
Then you explore my soul

[Chorus: x2]

In the middle
I lose control
In the middle
I lose my mind as well
In the middle
Everyday
In the middle
Love's got me chained

576,Dokken,Into the Fire,"You weave your spell
Your eyes beckon me
Your lips they speak, lies and misery
I know it's wrong, but I can't turn away
The flames draw near, they're telling me to stay

(Into the fire) I'm falling
(Into the fire) I'm falling
Into the fire

Your love burns bright, and yet the flames are cold
This time I fear, you won't be back no more
When will it end, your love consumes my soul
Into the fire, I'm being tempted once more

(Into the fire) I'm falling
(Into the fire) I'm falling
Into the fire

Take me back where I came from
Don't wanna see your face no more
You broke my heart, now it's not the same
I'm falling, again
I'm falling, again
Into the fire"

There's nothing left to take

Why, baby, why did you make me let you go
And leave you so lonely
Why, baby, why did you have to hold on
You know it's not love anymore

Gave you your last chance but you didn't believe me
You can't keep me satisfied, the way that you treat me

Told me of your heart, that you had been away

How I wish I could take you away
I would show you that my love's not the same
But I see I've found you too late

To break down all these walls that you have made
But my eyes see that it's too late

Should of seen right through
Over and over falling in love with you
Wanting you for myself- my first mistake
Finding out the hard way
Was all that I could take

You were just using someone
And I was the one

She said ""You just got lucky""
I believed your deadly lies
""You just got lucky""
You're a devil in disguise

Don't want to hear no lies- no apologies
Imagination gets the best of me
I'm looking everywhere- still I see your face
I'll never forget you- you put me in my place

You were just using someone
And I was the one

She said ""You just got lucky""
I believed your deadly lies
""You just got lucky""
I've been hypnotized
She said ""You just got lucky""
I believed your deadly lies
""You just got lucky""
You're a devil in disguise

Now that is over and I've seen right through
Not looking back again I'll start anew
Was making love to you such a wasted time
Maybe I love you, still, I'll get you off my mind

You were just using someone
And I was the one

She said ""You just got lucky""
I believed your deadly lies

580,Dokken,Kiss of Death,"A brief encounter
Like wind through the trees
It came so suddenly
But then it was gone
Like it had never been
How could I have ever seen
A lost heart
Will take your soul

How could I have known
How could I have known
As she took me in her arms
And brought me to an end
With the kiss of death
The kiss of death

She promised paradise
As she lied upon her bed
Like a fallen angel
With the devil's charm
She promised paradise
With the kiss of death

I tried to stop
As she held out her hand
But the fire was burning inside
She knew what I wanted
She gave it and more
But now I must pay the price
We were strangers
Passing in the night

How could I have known
How could I have known
As she took me in her arms
And brought me to an end
With the kiss of death
The kiss of death

She promised paradise
As she lied upon her bed
Like a fallen angel
With the devil's charm
She promised paradise
With the kiss of death

As she took me in her arms
I felt the devil's charm
Suddenly I see
The final destiny
With the kiss of death
The kiss of death

She promised paradise
As she lied upon her bed
Like a fallen angel
With the devil's charm
She promised paradise
With the kiss of death

581,Dokken,Lightnin' Strikes Again,"The lights go down
You can feel it all around you
Like a razor's edge that cuts through the air
You can hear the sound
It's coming down like thunder
You don't have to tell me why
You don't have to care

When the lightnin' strike again
And the lights go down
And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again

You draw the line
And you leave it all behind you
You lost your mind and then you lose control
By the time
That you feel the lightnin' strike you
You know you've been holding back
You've got to let it go"
582,Dokken,Little Girl,"Mother never told you
That's all right
Don't you cry
Now the visions dance inside your head

What was said?
Go to bed 
What have you done
Done to yourself?

What will you do
If I just leave you alone inside little girl?
No where to run
No where to hide except inside little girl

In the tapestries with faded clowns
All year 'round
Bringing you down
Trying to escape in your own ways

Not today
How can you see with your head in the clouds?
What will you do 
If I just leave you alone inside little girl?

No where to run
No where to hide except inside little girl
You carry the weight of the world
No one expects you to bear that burden

If you can let it all go
Even the daze will seem so much brighter
Every night holds a surprise for you"

584,Dokken,Long Way Home,"(dokken, pilson, lynch)


Sitting in the crossfire all alone
Waiting for a world to show the way
Tried to find a rose without a thorn
Such a foolish notion fades away

[if it's all] in my mind
Then why does it feel
Like there isn't any time

Walk the road [follow the madness]
Of someone's path
Search for self [well it doesn't mean you're wrong]
If you can
'cause it's gonna be ['cause it's gonna be]
A long way home
Wandering through the maze of all the fears
In the mind it makes no sense at all
Tell me not what I'm supposed to do
Crucify you christ without my cross

If it's all in my mind
Then why does it feel
Like I'm running out of time

Walk the road [follow the madness]
Of someone's path
Search for self [well it doesn't mean you're wrong]
If you can
'cause it's gonna be ['cause it's gonna be]
A long way home

Mythical past
Future behind me, shattered
I could not be
Someone beside
Take back my soul, my soul

Walk the road [follow the madness]
Of someone's path
Search for self [well it doesn't mean you're wrong]
If you can
'cause it's gonna be
A long way home

585,Dokken,Lost Behind the Wall,"When the sun fades to black and the night has come
There's a will to survive that's ruled by the gun
There's a fear in your eyes and a dream that was lost
There's a hand of fate let you die on the cross

You never really had a chance
Die Mauer muss weg
Tear it down

All of your life grows cold
When you're lost behind the wall
All of the dreams you've ever known
Will be lost behind the wall

Misfortune can hide the freedom to choose
The strong will survive and there's no win or lose
There's reason to fight but no way to cope
It's better to die than to live without hope

You never really had a chance
Die Mauer muss weg
Tear it down

All of your life grows cold
When you're lost behind the wall
All of the dreams you've ever known

A conversation over tea
Then he told me / I'm standing all alone
There's a crowd of people eating at my throne
Is it just me / is it just you
Or is it everyone
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the maddest hatter
Of them all
And it's so contrary that I know I shouldn't
Watch the rainbows circle my friend mary
I wish that I could fly so I can see much more
I wish that I could see things
Like the others do
If it's just me / then it's just you
I'm not the only one
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the maddest hatter

Tale of woe open up my eyes
Keeping me from the other side
Satisfy what my soul believes
If it could only see

On a red sky
In a green sea
On a black night
I fell to my knees

Save it for the innocent
Save it for the cruel
And leave it in the shadows of life
On a ship full of hopes and dreams
Took a trip down to misery
Realized that I'd been before
I found it hard to believe

On a red sky
In a green sea
On a black night
I fell to my knees

Save it for the innocent
Save it for the cruel
And leave it in the shadows of life
Read between the lines
These are angry times
Save it for the innocent
Save it for the cruel
And leave it in the shadows of life

If you're so in love with me / why do you stay away

Feeling I've been wrong about you
Try to justify
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside
Shattered
Shattered / trying to get to you
Left my heart in broken pieces / haven't been so true
Leave me / in my barren world
When I try to give you all I hear the cry of love
There's no words and there's no time for
All the reasons why
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside
Shattered
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside

Rainbow dreams crossing through my eyes
Shattered pictures in my mind
Love lost / lorn
Shattered / shattered / shattered / yeah"

Leaves me no consolation
Life fades like distant waves
Return again
No need to hide

A new chance to live
And walk that road to the end
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
And I hope that you feel the same
Love is a mystery
That gives up no secrets
Embraces everyone
No hesitation
We try to find religion
How many books can we read
We look for love and romance
How hard can it be
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
And I hope that you feel the same
In a way - we lost our innocence
In a day - we'll walk that road to the end
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
In the way I look at you

I can feel that there's been a change
It must be the sign of the times how I feel

Through the streets at night
He's smiling like no other
As he paid again
Look to find another

Watching the world go by
Standing in the shadows
He was looking
Looking for a place to hide

He felt this way before
And knew he wanted more
He knew the dawn would come
And he'd be on the run

But still they drove him on
Like a loaded gun
His time was running out
And he realized that he'd been here before

Like a scream in the night
For his crime they showed no pity
Even though they'd done the same
It?s the way of life in the city

Standing in the shadows
Watching the world go by
Standing in the shadows

Looking for a place to hide

When you open your eyes and feel me inside you
Why would you leave me for others

Been a long cold winter
Summer's come and gone
Your words were so bitter
My resurrection's just begun
Dead of winter
No pain only borrowed
You drink from my soul
You'll taste bitter sorrow

They say the sun won't shine
Where I'm going
It's too late to change my mind
It's over

You were the one that took me there
All the king's horses

Never gonna put my love
Back into your arms again

Where I'm going
The bitter sorrow chimes

[sweet chains]

You were the one that took me there
Tears of joy for a soul that had died
A soul, kept for so long in fear of it's passing
So would he or at least, so would he have believed
Revelation came late and unexpected
The soul dies only to be reborn a birth of pain and peace
The pain of knowing the hurt it had brought to so many
Revelation...
The peace of life unfolding through eyes anew
A chance of finding the truth
Or at least, so would we have believed

I danced with my friends 'til they had to go
My spirit stayed -give me no relief
My spirit stayed -gave me no release
How they loved the sweet life

I'm destined to run with the holy

Dying inside ever slowly
I'll be on my way

Sitting alone in a darkened room

609,Dokken,There Was a Time,"D. Dokken/K. Keeling

It was late like the storm
Finding it hard tried to carry on
Without fear or the shame
We could walk in park without being afraid

Was a time I believed
As the story unfolded so free
Now the passion is gone
All wrong
Down to the lake moonlit dawn

There was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need
They say that it's starting to show
Should have seen it long ago
There was a time I believed
You were everything I need

As a child
We believed
We could wake from the night and the dawn it seemed
Was so warm
So warm
Into His arms like a child I was born

Was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need

Interlude

You took me like the sage
Searching for some absolution
Hard to know the reason nobody cared
Once upon a time

Take me right away
Let me know there's still a season
Let me know there's still a reason to live
I'm running out of time

There was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need
They say that it's starting to show
Should have seen it long ago
There was a time I believed
You were everything I need

So now I'm taking a chase of Cavasier
With all of those words that we shouldn't have said
Walking the beach for the last time again
Missing you more than I should

There seems no point of view 
Over, under, upside down
I don't know what to do
There used to be a passion
Don't know when it slipped away
I look around at everyone
It happens everyday

I need to get off 
This spinnin' merry go round 
I'm upside down
No sense in talkin' 'till the morning comes
I need to feel it once again
This fire is dyin' 
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin' 
I can't feel the passion that we had before, anymore

contradiction, trepidation, different points of view
Sitting in a place I said I'd never go with you 
Given half a chance I guess I'd throw it all away
My opinion doesn't matter when there's shades of grey

I need to know what you're lookin' for
No sense in talkin' 'till the morning comes
I need to feel it once again
This fire is dyin' 
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin' 
I can't feel the passion that we had before, anymore

(guitar solo)

I need the passion to live my life
Live my dreams the way I like
Give no reasons for what I am
I try to love you the best I can

This fire is dyin' 
I can't feel the passion that we had before, anymore

You left it all behind
Now you're feeling oh so better

You should've seen me there (Yeah)
Too high to fly, my baby

The lines on the street, and the some rises
You looked too long for heaven, now you're blinded, baby

Another morning sun
Another day gone by
The storm's coming
With the pouring rain

The lines in the street, and the smoke rises
Wanderin' round for forty days, hope you find it

To break the spell
Straight to the top

Up against the odds
Thoughts of revenge are going trough me
Fate lies in the cards

Don't say that you did it for me

617,Dokken,Voice of the Soul,"Can you see the soul / through a window in your mind
Can you see the darkness that was left me over time
Bordering on sadness / no tranquility
Look through my mirror and you'll see
[so long] a vision come and gone
[inside] nothing was clear
Saving grace / forgotten road
I was lost / but now I'm home
Saving grace / a ray of hope
When I hear a voice of the soul
Sold my religion / sold my candles too
Knees have been bleeding / praying over you
I search the heavens / all I ever see
Dust from the ashes / misery
[rise up] sleeping with misfortune
[temptation] a mirror of myself
Saving grace / forgotten road
I was lost / but now I'm home
Saving grace / a ray of hope
When I hear a voice of the soul
When the light shines above me
And casts a shadow of myself
Look to skies that surround me
Embrace the one that speaks inside
Delivered unto self
Saving grace a ray of hope
When I hear the voice [of the soul]
[voice of the soul]
Saving grace
[voice of the soul]
When I hear the voice
Hear the voice of the soul

To see what i could see

Your love i borrowed just like time
It wasn't mine to keep
But the love we shared
I thought was there
And now you have to leave

Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say i'm sorry
But i can't find a way
(to) just walk away

Couldn't see for i was blind
The hurt you hide inside
I didn't mean to break your heart
I wish it had been mine

And as another day unfolds
Don't know what it means
Was it love we had
Or love gone bad
Still the love we need

Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say i'm sorry
But i can't find a way

Waiting for a sign
I didn't mean to break your heart
I wish it had been mine

Searching for someone to blame
I don't know who to believe
But I know who's gonna set me free

But too many things were in my head
Then the sun began to rise
Still I haven't gone to bed
Why do all these questions dance around inside my head
All I want to do is close my eyes and go to bed
Let tomorrow bring the answers that I need instead
And let it go / let it go
Is there anybody who believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free / set me free
Hope that I can sleep tonight
Close my eyes and slip away
Dream about some other place
Where the sun shines in my head
Out of all the people in my life I love you more
And I hope that time will find a way to make it sure
That we stay one and the same
Is there anybody who believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free - set me free
You're the only person in my life
And I hope that time will find a way to make it right
And whatever happens you will know
I love you more
Is there anybody who believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free / set me free

621,Dokken,Will the Sun Rise?,"In the name of liberty, we set off to the sea
In the name of glory, fighting to be free
But one mistake can set it all to rest
No one sees and no one wins the game of chance
I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise another day
A simple answer, that all of us should see
Let things be what they may be
Open your eyes, do you think that you're the best
Try to see the light before the final test
I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise another day
Someone is watching, waiting to see
If there's a chance before the sun fades for eternity
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise another day
Will the sun rise, I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, I need to know

Will the sun rise
Will the sun rise

Sent long ago
To your self long ago
What are you looking for?

The line is long
You're too far out
No hidden meanings here
But I have to spell it out
Sleep in late
Or never wake
Missing such a good time
Thinking that you're never gonna throw it all away

They found your message on the other side of life
But they don't want you over
They don't wanna cry
Seems that you've gone too far caught up in your self
Better find your way out
It's not all about ""You""

Into the light of the sun
Now you're gone
Send me a word out of faith
You'll be home
Far away

That life is going your way
The things you need are superficial indeed
And leading you astray, far away

I'm on the key,
Behind the wheel.
No need to beg or borrow
'Cause I steal."
667,Enuff Z'nuff,Unemotional,"Unemotional You looked so dumb I had to laugh. 
You stand there yelling at a photograph.
It reminds you
And it brings you down again,
And now it seems
That you've become a psychopath.
He's so hot and she's so unemotional.
It's a battle 'till the end
That could never end as friends.
He's so hot and she's so unemotional.
There was nothing he could do,
All the feelings that were through.

Say goodbye to yesterday, 
And all those nasty things
You used to say.
Try to find your smiling face again,
So hard to make the feelings
For her go away.

She's hurting you again!"
668,Enuff Z'nuff,Wake Up,"Wake Up Pretty one, today's your day.
I've come to take you home.
I've heard your call, from miles away.
A girl like you should not be on her own.
I'm so into you, and don't you know,
I'd die for you. I'd die for you.
You've got to wake up,
And answer the voice in your head.
Wake up, and find something
Warm in your bed.
Wake up, and get it together.
And never be lonely again.

I have got a dream for two,
Just waiting to begin.
All you really have to do is
Open up your heart and let me in.
I'm so into you. And don't you know,
I'd lie for you, I'd die for you.

Repeat Chorus.

Never be lonely again.
Never be lonely again.
Never be lonely, never be lonely,
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever...

I can give you anything
It takes to keep you near.
If you wait for bells to ring,
They might be ringing now
And you don't hear.
I'm so into you. And don't you know,
I'd die for you, I'd die for you."
669,Enuff Z'nuff,What Can I Do?," What Can I Do? What could I do to make you cry?
What could I do to make you cry?
What could I do to devastate your heart?
Or, what could I do to win your love?
I've been staring at the sun,
Cuz it's the only thing I know
That's still warm and bright.
I should be wailing at the moon,
Cuz I've been kicked out like a dog.
All cold and alone at night.
Who would have ever thought I'd lose you?
It's something that you made up in your mind.
I've got your better years
Cuz lately you're no prize.
Why look for love right here?
There's nothing in your eyes.

Repeat Chorus.

I've been drinking you away.
Oh I'm drowning in a vodka & lemonade.
And about a million times a day,
I still think about you baby,
And that's why I'm so afraid,
You were just looking for a reason,
To go away and be with someone else.
The devil's advocate is grinning once again.
I hope the road you take
Don't lead you to your end.

What could I do to make you cry?
What could I do to make you cry?
What could I do to make you feel my pain?
Or, what could I do to win your love?

The parasite is gonna use you,
And what he don't use up he'll throw away.
So show your tarot cards
Where nothing ever shines.
Let's hope this floppy disc
Holds up to my hard drive.

What could I do to make you cry?
What could I do to make you cry?
How do I win the key into your heart?
Or, what could I do to win your love?

670,Enuff Z'nuff,Wheels,"Wheels I'm a little boy blue,
I'm the man on the moon.
I'm a bit freaked out
And a hair out of tune,
They tell me that
I might just lose it soon.
I'm the guy with a little
And ten's not enough,
But after nineteen
You're hooked on the stuff.
I float away
just like a big balloon.
Sometimes nothing's colder than the sun,
On a bad day.
Sometimes nothing warms you

Rolling over everything in front of me.

Burning like the soul that's inside me.
I'm a wheel, wheels turn.

I've been in, I've been out.
A confident smile
And a heart full of doubt.
I work until I'm oh so tired out.
I make sisters and brothers with everyone, 
We howl at the moon
And we run from the sun.
Lately I don't know
What it's all about.
Love has got me down before

Somehow even found the easy way, yeah!

Your heart's no good,

Words of fire, and a burnt out liar.
We were quite a pair, what a sad affair.
Now don't you cry, just say goodbye.

If birds are free, oh why aren't we? "

Maybe we learned to fight, as part of a routine
Maybe we jumped the wall, suddenly tipped the scale
Maybe we tried too hard, so afraid to fail

This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again

Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain."

A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change,
Made them realize, that the promises were lies.

Made the nation bleed
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn.

Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.

They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change,
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies.

So much to bear, all that pain
Left them in despair
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn.

Even though you're mistreating me
I know the girl that you used to be
For me those days were meant to last forever.

Time after time I'm wondering why
Am I to be all alone
Day after day I pray that you'll stay
Cause you've got a heart of stone.

I walk the streets like a broken man
Oh I wish that you would understand
Even though you're still the one I wait for.

Sometimes it's not what it seems to be
Even though you're still the one I care for.

My spirit finds its way across the ocean

And my soul cries out for leaving now
I have got to get back home somehow
She stole my heart, oh how my spirit cried
Cause I had to leave and it broke me up inside

Here comes the night
It's gonna be a long and lonely night
I see tomorrow in a different light
This long and lonely night

I've got a weary head and worn out shoes
A bottle of rum and as I sing the blues
The bitter wind sends shivers down my spine

I'm a ramblin' man with a ramblin' mind
I left my loved ones far behind
She stole my heart, oh how my spirit cried
Cause I had to leave and it broke me up inside

A drifter I was meant to be
With no one there for company
But if one day down there road I can,
Would you look my way
Would you take me back again

Come miles around
And my heart´s still beatin´
For those country grounds

Remember when our hearts
Were filled with laughter
It echoes in my trail
Of fallen tears
But no matter where I am today
Or what the future might bring
I will remember those
Long gone years

I can´t let go
I wanna know
Does it have to end
For the best of friends

As long as you can feel

As long as you can touch

A holocaust maybe be spread

When you're livin' in a memory

Just like prisoners in paradise
So close but yet so far
There will come a time
No matter who you are
When you ask yourself
Was it right or wrong
For me to turn away but hey
We're just children of tomorrow
Hangin' on to yesterday

I've gone through pain
But there's not enough reason for me to go insane
I know the feeling, when it grows
I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes.

You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want.

Rock now, rock the night
'Til early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night
You'd better believe it's right.

I know my limit
Just what it takes
When things ain't good enough
I just pull the brake
Sometimes it's easy
Sometimes so tough
But just have one thing clear
I can't get enough."

It came to be a sad time in your life I roll with you we'll get you through

When you shut your eyes I'll show the images you're missing
When you've heard enough through me you can listen

Tell me why can't we settle for love before it's too late

We can't fool each other anymore
Maybe there is a light that won't go out

About a tragic comedy
Newspaper hinted suicide,
The letterhead read dear johnny
A tainted truth was all it said,
Sleep tight now that
You've made your bed
An arrow that once pierced your heart
Points to the apple on your head

Three sides to every story
Yours, mine
And, Monday morning's

Cupid's dead, headlines read,
Cupid's dead
Cupid's dead, headlines read,
Cupid's dead

Oh, romeo, oh, romeo
Where did our love go, romeo? 
If you read between the headlines,
You wouldn't be the last to know
No mystery yet to unfold,
A paperboy left in the cold
A love was said to never die,
Withered away and just got old

'our top story tonight,
Is a crime of passion
The victim, an unidentified man,
Is found in bed, wearing only a diaper,
Holding a bow an arrow in one hand,
And clutching a letter in the other.
The letter simply read 
Cupid's dead.'

Extra, extra, extra,
Read all about it

Cupid's dead,

Cupid is dead, deceased,
I got peace of mind
Still it's hard to forget,
What it leaves behind
A lot of love lost,
Your feelings are wasted,
Tasted the sweetness,
But now you're faced with,
The thought, of being alone
Nor more companionship,
You can handle it,
Just abandon it,
Leave it behind,
And look for the brighter day
Give it some time,
Cause it won't come right away
You gotta be standing strong,
Hold on to your dignity
Don't sit around,
Saying look what ya did to me
It's time to move on,
You gotta continue
To look for a love,
Of a life that's within you
Cupid is dead now,
It's time to rely on,
Yourself to cope
You got no shoulder to cry on
Dead"

Though it's sad but true, this is just another verse.
If you can't take it with you, then what's the use?

This one's been told
Another heart broken,
Left out in the cold
With one variation,
The difference this time,
This one is mine,
Since you've been gone
You've stolen my heart
As for the rest of me
I've fallen apart
In my desperation
My only prayer
Handle with care

'cause I don't know
What to do
Wasting my time,
Wandering through
Wondering why
What's it all worth
My last hour on earth
My last hour

So in the end
You were the one
Something so right
Could never be wrong
Without hesitation
I'll tell you the truth
I'm still waiting for you

'cause I don't know
What to do
Wasting my time,
Wandering through
Wondering why
What's it all worth
My last hour on earth
My last hour

'cause I don't know
What to do
Wasting my time,

It's worth everything
Yeah my everything is you

There is no god
Confused thy talk in parables
Accused thou walk in parallels
A simple game of Simon says
This month's flavor sciences
Today's fact, tomorrow's fiction
Leave the rest to superstition
If knowledge comes from learning books
Wisdom comes from discerning looks
A fool that says there is no god
Don't feel for that sorry sod
Who needs proof then he'll believe
I wonder if he's been deceived

There is no god"
800,Extreme,Tragic Comic,"Flowers, I sent,
Were found dead on their arrival
The words, I said,
Inserted foot in my mouthful
So when, we dance,
My lead it ain't so graceful
(isn't so, not ain't so)

I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-poet
Just call me a tragic comic
Cause I'm, in, in love with you

And when, we dine,
I forget to push in your seat
I wear, the wine,
Spilling hearts all over my sleeve
A stitch, in time,
Proposing down on my knees
(splitting between the seams)

I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-poet
Just call me a tragic comic
Cause I'm, in, in love with you

Nobody, can know the,
Trouble I've, seen
Nobody, can know the,
Trouble I, get into,
When I'm with you"
801,Extreme,Unconditionally,"So tell me, what can I do
That you couldn't see through
From the very start?
There is only one thing
Yet to come from my heart

Loving you, unconditionally
Loving you, unconditionally
That's what I want to be
What you are to me

Can you see why it's so hard
For me to break apart
From all the things I hold
Closer to a heart
That has grown far too cold?

Loving you, unconditionally
Something new
To a heart yet not free
That's what I want to be
What you are to me

And though it seems impossible
When both of my hands are full
That's the only condition
That keeps me
From loving you"

Cross the line,
Don't even bother
To waste my time

What's that
Look in your eyes?
It's time I cut you.
Down to size

803,Extreme,Watching Waiting,"Hanging above the ground
All my limbs are bound
You're on the right hand
With your head down
Tears from eyes that cannot see
He took the blame from me
So shall it be written
So shall it be done

Watching, waiting
Staring at the Son
Not even knowing
Who you are

Three hours have gone by
We start to question why
Darkness falls in finding out
Why you must die
We can no longer see the Son
The three untie into one
Please forgive us Father
We know not what we've done"
804,Extreme,When I First Kissed You,"New york city can be so pretty
]from a bird's eye view
Because up there
Yeah, that's where I first kissed you
A modern day romance
A perfect performance
Acting like two fools
Saying silly things
Whisper sweet nothings
Live young lovers only do

I was shaking
You were breathtaking
Like the empire state
My voice was so far
Not quite Sinatra
Singing songs so great
The clock struck one
The night still very young
In the city that never sleeps
Then a whirlwind blew
When I first kissed you
Nearly swept me
Swept me off my feet

When I first kissed you
That's when I knew
I was in love

Because up there
Yeah, that's where
I first kissed you"
805,Extreme,When I'm President,"I remember it well
I was just about three
My dad said
son what do you want to be?
It didn't ring no bells but I said
daddy I'm a bit too young what do you want from me?

I'm much older now
I'm almost a man
I can do anything, you bet I can
Raise a family
Now wouldn't that be grand
So sorry but I got bigger plans

You can be anything in the world today
Something like a preacher, a teacher
A baseball player
Those kind of things I just don't care
I want to represent the usa

The american dream
As far as the eye I say can you see
I want to be
I want to be the leader of the country

When I'm president
Things will be different
We'll start a new government
When I'm president
When I'm president
You can be in my cabinet
I'll be your heaven sent
President

First things first we're gonna change the rules
Better listen up all you boys and girls
Your president says there'll be no after school
So vote for me wouldn't that be cool

Yeah! yeah!

Now I know there's trouble in the middle east
I'll spend all the money when I stop the arms race
All my brothers in the desert
Gonna have themselves a feast
When that's done then we'll start on world peace

So go ask Alice
Cos you know what he said
What did he say? 
Remember, I wanna be elected"
806,Extreme,Who Cares?,"Tell me Jesus, are you angry?
One more sheep has just gone astray
A hardening of hearts turning to stone
Wandering off so far from home

So many children losing time
Walk in darkness looking for a sign
Chasing their rainbows, future looks so bright
Slowly we're losing sight of the light

Who cares, who cares, who cares?
Tell me who cares, who cares?

Who cares, who cares, who cares?
Tell me who cares, who cares?

All alone out in the cold
Can't look back, am I growing old?
I chose a path and is this my fate?
Am I finding out the truth too late?

Who cares, who cares, who cares?
Tell me who cares, who cares?

Who cares, who cares, who cares?
Tell me who cares, who cares?

Here I am, a naked man
Nothing to hide with empty hands
Remember me, well I am the one
Who lost his way your prodigal son?

Can anybody, anybody?
Anybody, any luck
Anybody, any luck

Am I ever gonna change?
Will I always stay the same?
I say one thing an' I do the other
Same old song goes on forever
Ever gonna change
I just take it dead, I know
My will is weak but my bless is strong
Loose I seem to that yearn of gold"
807,Extreme,Wind Me Up,"I've got something that you ought to know

Wind me up and leave me blue
I'd like to see if you could be
Kind enough to me when you

Color me red then leave me blue"
808,Faster Pussycat,Babylon,"Livin' in L.A. is so much fun
Boy you is ugly and your girlfriend weighs a ton

Wake me up before you go go, baby

No we won't shut up, we're just Babylon and on
Babylon on, Babylon and on
Shut up

Met a hoochie-koochie named Dizzy Cowabunga
I said ""Shut your face and take off what you got under""
Went outside, said ""your place, not mine
Cause my granny's on the couch and she smells like she might die""

No we won't shut up, we're just Babylon and on

Shut up

And I feel like crawling under a rug
If I fell on my face
I know that you'd be there to help me up

'Cause it's you, only you that makes me strong
Ain't nobody gonna make me live my life alone

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
A friend will always be there when I grow old

You know, lovers they come and go
Like ships to a dock, a bunch of heartbreakers they are
They blind you with their innocence 
Tie your heart in knots
If I need some hope
And I feel I'm at the end of my rope
You make that funny face
You're always there to cheer me up

'Cause it's you, only you to take me along
Ain't nobody I'd rather have to help me sing a song

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
A friend will always be there when I grow old

'Cause it's you, only you that makes me strong
Ain't nobody I'd rather have to help me sing a song

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
A friend will always be there when I grow old
Won't think it's funny
Will stand for me when others call me a dummy
A friend will always be there when I grow
A friend will always be there when I grow
A friend will always be there when I grow old"

Well, he'll be here soon.""

Five years old and talking to myself.
Where were you? Where'd you go?

No, there's no one home
In my house of pain

Wasn't I worth the time?
A boy needs a daddy like a dance to mime and all the time
I looked up to you.

I paced my room a million times.
And all I ever got was one big lie, the same old lie.
How could you?

Well, I was eighteen and still talking to myself.
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame.

813,Firehouse,All She Wrote,"I got home late on a Saturday night
And I knew right away something wasn't right
I knew she was gone

She took all I had but, left a hole in my heart
Should've known it would go bad, right from the start
What did I do wrong?

I can't understand why she would leave me this way
With nothing to say
Then I found the note on the door
It said good-bye and she don't want me no more

[Chorus]
""Bye bye baby, bye bye...."", She said in her letter
And that was all she wrote
Guess this is goodbye, guess this is forever
And that was all she wrote

I called on the phone, but she wasn't there
Should've know all along that she just didn't care
Why did she have to go?

Now I look at her picture and I wonder why
She left me this way...-Why did she say goodbye?
I guess I'll never know

I can't understand why she would leave me this way
With nothing to say
I remember the note on the door
It said good-bye and she don't want me no more

Now your leaving's killing me and the time we spent together
Why can't we tape the picture that is scattered on the floor
I guess there's just no love here anymore

[Chorus]
I can't hide from my emotions
Stop old dreams and crush my fears and turn away forever
I'll get by without you now so leave me alone
You won't be there tomorrow
Your love is like an arrow through my heart

I tried everything I could to hold onto that life
But now I see I realized I wasn't always right
I'll take the good and leave the bad and walk out of the door
I guess there's just no love here anymore

Well I'm just trying to do the best that I can
So why are you always bringing me down?
I make the best of every circumstance
so why are you always bringing me down?
Does it make you feel better?

Anytime that I want to do anything
You tell me it's not right
And it seems like every time, you talk to me
You're trying to start a fight

And I don't know how much more I can take of you
When you put down, and you turn around
Every single thing that I do

I get kicked in the face still I come back for more

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces and start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl I can't take anymore

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you'll ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
(Well) you can do anything, but baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad

I gave it everything, but you threw it all away
I can't take anymore of these games that you play
I've been through heartache and I've been through pain
And it's hard to believe you still treat me this way

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces and start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl I can't take anymore

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you'll ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad

Never too late to say we're sorry and try another way
I'm down on my knees, I need you baby
Don't walk away

Now we've both done things that we regret
We could learn to forgive and forget
We'll make it better, give it another try
Baby, don't give up, don't give in

Walkin' away won't solve anything
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do to keep you satisfied

You know my hands were tied, and you know how hard I tried
To never let you go

Seems they're mindin' everybody's business but their own
Well I do things my own way and I ain't afraid to say

Get a life
I've got better things to do than to mess around with you
Go out and get your own life
Get a life

I'm always walking the line when I ain't done no crime
I get hassled for no reason at all
See I've got my own plan tryin' to be my own man
Still they don't understand what went wrong

Everyone's got an opinion but I don't need no advice
Seems they're mindin' everybody's business but their own
Well I do things my own way and I ain't afraid to say

You're no better than anyone else
Before you criticize you'd better open you eyes

Don't ever let it go
Hold the dream

Don't ever let it get you down
When they turn their back on you
Just do what feels right for you
You can find what you're looking for
Don't get lost along the way
Always be strong. Your heart can't be wrong
Don't give up and your dreams will come true

A dream so real
You can feel it in the palm of your hand

I want to be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true

I dedicated my life to you
You know that I would die for you
But our love would last forever
And I will always be with you
And there is nothing we can't do

To care for somebody that much
And it scares me to think 
How this could be dangerous

Now it's too late to turn back I've fallen for you
There's nothing I wouldn't do

I believe I could walk on your water
I would drown in your river of love
And I know I could walk through the fire
I would burn in the flames of your heart
If I get too close to you I might hurt myself
Like a moth that flies too close to the flame
I can't help it, 'cause for your love I'd do anything

I would walk for a million miles
Just to get one step closer to you
I'd give everything that I own
Just to spend time alone with you

But I couldn't ever see you with another guy
And you're not just an ordinary woman
And it ain't like I'm no ordinary man

You know it' you honey I'm in love this time
I'm in love this time

The house is clean my supper's warm
And when my bones are tired and sore
You keep me satisfied and give me so much more

And it ain't like I'm no ordinary man
'Cause you make me feel so good inside
I can't get you outside of my mind
No one's ever felt so right

If this is make believe, then I don't want to leave

832,Firehouse,In Your Perfect World,"Seems I just can't do enough
I could never win your love
Why should I try
When you never share your feelings?
How could I be so naive? 
Is it so hard to believe
That you excel in emotional concealing?

No matter what I do 
I never measure up for you
But you just keep that smile on your face
No matter how much I try
You're never really satisfied
Until you run away and hide

In your perfect world
Where there's no one to blame
No one can hurt your feelings
And you don't feel no pain
Everybody loves you
And nobody gets burned
As long as you are living
In your perfect world

It seems like everyone gets screened
On your answering machine
Can't take the call
And let down your defenses
You can't let anybody see
Your real personality
Is it pride, or just your false pretenses?

Maybe a part of you has died
Because you keep it all inside
But still you wear that smile on your face
It seems no matter what I do
I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you

In your perfect world
Where nothing can go wrong
You're always in control
And we all get along
And everything is beautiful
No need for concern
As long as you are living
In your perfect world

Maybe a part of you has died
Because you keep it all inside
Is it hard to keep that smile on you face
It seems no matter what I do
I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you

Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road

There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey
Down the Seven Bridges Road

To show you what I want to do to you
With all respect your intellect takes a back seat this time
It's the physical attraction that turns me on

There's just somethin' 'bout you body
That makes me want you all the time
Oh I want your body but all I get from you is
A piece of your mind (there's just somethin' 'bout your body)

The intelligent approach is gonna be most likely to succeed
I'm thinkin' about you, do you think about me
I really feel I could fulfill your full mental capacity

Baby step right up and don't be shy
There's no doubt tonight's the night
The way you've been teasin' me we're both gettin' hot
Now I think it's time you show me everything you've got
It's time to shed your inhibitions and fulfill my fantasies
To see you wearing nothing but a smile makes me scream
Take it off
Get naked from your head down to your toes
Don't hide your body underneath those fancy clothes
I want you to let it all hang out
And when I see you shake it makes me want to shout
Take it off
So take 'em down and hit the lights
Show me that you've got nothing to hide
I don't mean any disrespect you've got sex appeal
I just can't control the way you make me feel
It's time to strip your inhibitions and indulge my fantasies
To see you wearing nothing but a smile makes me scream
Take it off
Get naked from your head down to your toes
You look much better when you're not wearing any clothes
I want you to let it all hang out
And when I see you shake it makes me want to shout
Take it off

The serpent slithered up and said see'mon let's eat

Just like anybody, the devil got me too
And now there's nothing I can do

Because temptation is comin' onto me, temptation
I'm just too blind to see your sweet temptation
Knockin' at my door, temptation I just got to get some more

The neighbor's wife is pretty and she wants a truth or dare
She justifies adultery as a meaningless affair
Later on that evening, lord she can't believe her eyes
Her old man's cheatin' lover's in a black book of disguise

Just like everybody I got a black book too
Now there's nothing I can do

I went from 8 to 18, dad went from me to her

[Chorus]
I remember the day and the week and the weather
The smile on your face as you walked away
I remember the part where he left us forever
At the time I thought that it was the end

Haven't you changed since you walked out that door
I wonder how it'd be if you hadn't found her

Just as long as we stay together
So now we can see just what love is to me and to you

How could love make you feel so good
When I looked at you it was then that I knew it was true

Now it all makes sense to me
You've got to take love seriously
Only you made it clear that the meaning of love 
Is you

856,Firehouse,The Nights Were Young,"Can you remember from way back when
It was the summer that we became best friends
And we made a promise that nothing could tear us apart
Now we used to hang out behind the old motel
We`d throw apples at cars and run like hell
We might`ve had a few close calls, but we never got caught
But when the sun went down we didn`t go home yet
We would lay on the grass and smoke cigarettes
And stare up at the sky and count up all the stars, that`s when

[Chorus:]
The nights were young and we thought that they would last forever
But nothing ever does so we`ll just have to remember
Though time slips by, the memories remain
I could never forget when the nights were young

Back then they said that we were way too young 
But we were old enough to have some fun
And we`d laugh until it hurt and we were both in tears
Now we used to stake out the neighborhood liquor store
We couldn`t go inside for a couple years more
So we`d send the older kids to sneak a couple of beers
We didn`t have a care or a worry back then
We could count on each other through thick and thin
Nothing could come in between us we swore `till the end, that`s when

[Chorus]
(Solo)
The nights were young and we thought that they would last forever
But nothing ever does so we`ll just have to remember
The nights were young and we swore we`d always be together
But we went our separate ways so we`ll just have to remember
Though time slips by the memories remain
I could never forget when the nights were young"
857,Firehouse,Trying to Make a Living,"Well I woke up this morning, pulled myself out of bed
I wish that I could sleep the day away
Just a day like any other, same old thing, over and over
I'm overworked and underpaid (and it's killing me)

Not even breakin' even, work my fingers to the bone
Barely gettin' by, keeps gettin' harder
I'm slaving on the grindstone and I get no breaks at all
Just trying to keep my head above the water

Can't make ends meet, can't even save a dime
Feels like I spend my life working overtime

[Chorus:]
Tryin' to make a livin', gotta pay the rent
(just) tryin' to make a livin', wonder where my money went
Never seem to get ahead, it's getting' easier to see
(just) tryin' to make a livin' and it's killing me

Times are getting tough seems I never make enough
Just doing what I can to stay alive
And I'd like to take a day off but I can't afford a layoff
Gotta keep this damn job to survive

Can't make ends meet I can't even save a dime
Feels like I spend my life working overtime

One works by the light of the day and the other one works at night
They both live so differently but they are so much alike
They both want the very same thing just to have a better way of life

You know you can't take sides 'cause no one's wrong or right
So don't make up you mind take another look before you decide

[Chorus:]
'Cause there are two sides to every story
Two different ways of looking at exactly the same thing
Two sides to every story
So don't make up your mind 'til ya hear the story from me

One nation's weak, one nation's strong
Two people side by side but they just can't get along
All war's too big ya know, no war's too small
One wants just a little piece and the other one wants it all

You know you can't take sides 'cause no one's wrong or right
So don't make up you mind take another look before you decide

Don't make up you mind there are two sides you'll see
Oh so let me tell it to you straight you gotta open up your eyes
You'll see perspective's everything and you just might change your mind

859,Firehouse,What's Wrong,"Brother please don't turn your back on me
I was once just like you but I've fallen through the cracks of society
Why can't anyone just lend a hand
Doesn't anybody care, doesn't someone understand
We should be ashamed because we lay the blame
Not on ourselves but on this day and age

[Chorus]
What's wrong with everybody
Why can't anybody get along
Well I think we've got a problem
We've got to help each other out or we'll never figure out
What's wrong with everybody

Five o'clock another traffic jam
All lanes merge to one and it seems like no one gives a damn
Why can't we just let each other in
But we cut each other off and we just keep on driving

We should be ashamed because we lay the blame
Not on ourselves but on this day and age

Why can't everyone just live in peace
Well we've got to pull together and put an end to this insanity
Why can't everyone just lend a hand
Doesn't anybody care, doesn't someone give a damn

So here we are face to face
And heart to heart
I want you to know we will
Never be apart
Now I believe that wishes can come true
'Cause I see my whole world
I see only you

When I look into your eyes
I can see how much I love you
And it makes me realize
When I look into your eyes
I see all my dreams come true
When I look into your eyes

Now that I've found you

Didn't think that love was possible

When the hammer falls, a voice inside you calls

Soul to soul, no control, breathin' in your heart beat

You're on the way to stone, and now as I lie here with you

Out of the dark and into the light, mission of these shames
I don't want to wait another lifetime, 'til this one happens again
What you've done is takin' me from the prison that I live in

There we'll be safe tonight, from the lonely days of memory

I'll see you in my dreams
Back in my arms again, and no matter what tomorrow brings

869,Giant,I'm a Believer,"Oh, go!

Girl, it's been awhile, you've lost your pretty smile, what happened?
Was it something that they said that's playing with your head, what happened?
When you're standing in the spotlight, woman, some people try an' take a shot
Well it's only jealousy, only jealousy, oh they can't see our love
But one thing you can be sure of

You know that I'm a believer, in you an' me
You know that I'm a believer, oh it's true
And no matter what you do, girl, I believe in you
I believe!

Oh it's never what you hear, it's only what you feel that matters
Left your brother stand alone, you kept climbing social ladders
When it comes down to basics, and we're lookin' at it one on one
It don't matter what they say, matter what they say
About us now, ah, can't hurt us now
But one thing you can be sure of

You know that I'm a believer, in you, I believe
You know that I'm a believer, oh it's true
And no matter what you do, girl, I believe

The only way to win child, is never play the game of love
But I'll be there to catch you even if you should ever fall
But one thing you can be sure of

You know that I'm a believer, in you, in me
You know that I'm a believer, girl it's true, and no matter what you do

You know I'm a believer, in you, in love
You know that I'm a believer, oh it's true

870,Giant,Innocent Days,"Visions, our love is a series of visions
A taste on my lips, a whispering word in your ear
Oh passion, we're children just playing with passion
Losing our grip, falling asleep at the wheel
Still we hold on to the bitter end, thinking we can never lose
Baby it's a cold night and the winds of change are blowing

And these are the innocent days
Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands
And these are the innocent days, I know we're the last of the runaways

Never return, till love takes us home
Lover, we're drowning our doubts in each other
Closing our eyes, we bury the truth in the sand
I cannot take it, 'cause when we don't feel it, we fake it
Oh someday these nights come back to haunt us again
Oh we lie here at the water's edge, wishing we could float away
'Cause it's too late to turn back, when the only bridge is burning

And these are the innocent days
Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands
And these are the innocent days, I know we're the last of the runaways

[Instrumental]

Still we hold on to the bitter end, thinking we can never lose
Baby it's a cold night and the winds of change are blowing
Oh they're blowing, they're cryin', they're cryin'

Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands

871,Giant,It Takes Two,"Oh here I am, looking back again, at the road that led to you
Oh the time's alright, tryin' to save myself from looking out at you
I walk alone, while you are waiting, but somehow you saw through me
And now I'm standing at your door, you're the only one I need

It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender, when love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two

I've been blinded by this fear inside that love is just a game
You distract yourself with someone else, and both havin' travelled in pain
Bow now I see the road I've taken, will lead me to nothing more
Than empty rooms without your love, girl, I'm standing at your door

It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender, when love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two
Oho

[Instrumental]

I walk alone while you are waiting, I know where I'm wanting to be
So now I'm standing at your door, you're the only one I need

It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender, when love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two"
872,Giant,Lay It on the Line,"When I was just a young boy, I had to work hard 'cause my daddy was gone
My momma said ""Son, life is never easy
And if you wanna win then you gotta be strong"", I gotta be strong
I heard her say ""It ain't ever black or white
But when it's time to choose, I know you'll do what's right
You gotta stand up and fight""
 Chorus:
Give it up - give it up, give it everything you got
Give it all, if you wanna take it to the top
Give it up - give it up, 'cause you know there'll come a time
When you gotta lay it, lay it, lay it, you gotta lay it on the line
Well I was only fifteen, when I heard that rock 'n' roll sound
(Oh what a sound)
I bought a secondhand six-string, and I played it outta that neon town
I still recall those old words from yesterday, I pick up that old guitar
And every time I play, I can still hear her say
chorus
(Instrumental break)
I remember those hard times, I always had to fight just to make it through
Now it's all behind me, but those old words still ring true
Still ring true now
The more it changes, the more it stays the same
And boy, I'm telling you, if you wanna play the game
The lesson's still the same

873,Giant,Lost in Paradise,"Since you've been gone, I spend my days dreamin' 'bout
The way things used to be with you
I carry on, but getting over lovin' you
Is the toughest thing I've ever had to do
'Cause you took me straight to heaven, and I've never been so high

[Chorus]
I'm lost in paradise, without your love my heart has paid the price
I won't let go of yesterday, will I ever find my way
I'm lost in paradise

I can't sleep at night, I reach out in the darkness
To hold you close, but you're not there
I try to forget this dream of making love to you
But the memory is more than I can bear
I could find a way to make it, if I knew that you still cared

Someday I'll find you, I'll search through heaven and hell
Until I have you back in my arms again, I'm lost in

I could not hold back the tears from my eyes

Love welcome home, I've been so alone
Dying inside, 'cause I'm so lost without you
Love welcome home, this heart of mine nearly turned to stone
Nearly turned to stone

Now I live right here indoor, oh night by night
Oh girl what you've done changes everything, what's right is right
When I'm lying next to you, I can see so perfectly, oh
It took so long, but now you're here with me

875,Giant,No Way Out,"Late, late last night, I saw a face that touched my soul
I knew that the time was right, so I moved on in and said hello
First we started talking, then we started walking
She said: ""I live 'long the next bent, have you met my boyfriend?
He'll be waiting up for you""

[Chorus]
And there's no way out, girl, I've got my back against the wall
Oh there's no way out, I don't get no second chance at all
And there's no way out

I said: ""hey, what's all this? I don't get off on playing games""
She smiled and she blew me a kiss, I saw my night go up in flames
He turned on the corner, night was getting warmer
Oh no, then I saw him coming, so I started running
This is like some crazy dream

[Chorus]

Late, late last night, I saw a face that broke my heart
I knew the time was right, oh baby, but I turned around and played it smart
No way out, girl, I've got my back against the wall
Oh there's no way out, I don't get no second chance at all

Yes there's no way out"
876,Giant,Now Until Forever,"Sometimes love feels like an empty room
It's cold and silent, you got nowhere to go
And sometimes the feeling's over way too soon
'Til you find someone who tells you so
And don't you know, you're my reason for tomorrow

[Chorus:]
And I need you, now until forever
All my life I've waited for someone like you
Love won't die if we put our hearts together
You and I can make this dream come true
Now until forever
I need you

We thread emotions to be strong enough to withstand all elements of time
When we're together where there's only love
Never felt a heartbeat so close to mine
Don't you know you're my reason for tomorrow

[Chorus]

It's our love, a love that lifts us high enough
We can survive any storm, where no one's ever been before
And tomorrow will be brighter now, even yesterday is new
And all our promises ring true, and everything I have, I give to you

Sometimes love feels like an empty room, but now that all seems oh so long ago

Paid the man, took it home and played it 'round the clock (yes I did)
Something's coming over me, time to let it roll, let it rock, yeah

It's time to burn, time to burn
It's time to burn, time to burn, time to burn

Flesh and blood, sweat on steel
So alive, I can't describe how it makes me feel
Plug it in, strap it on, let me show 'em what I've got
Something's coming over me, time to let it roll, let it rock, yeah

Turn it on, crank it up, gonna shake the whole damn block

Where would I be without you, lost and alone 'til your love pulled me through
If not for a heart so true, where would I be, I'd be without you
These four walls surround me, it's a price that I must pay

 When I was with you there
 I was going places I had to make it
 Out there somewhere
 All the temptations and expectations
 They shine so bright
 I didn't know what matters most
 I guess I just lost sight
 The higher I climb
 The longer that I'm away from you
 the more I know that having you close
 Is what gets me through
 It took me so long I finely caught on
 That it's not enough
 All of my dreams don't mean a thing
 Without your precious love
 Every night when I lie in my bed
 trying to make some sense
 I just think what I give
 to have you in my arms again
 I tried to run I couldn't see you where the one
 But all roads you know all roads lead back to you
 You're in my blood I've got to have your love
 Cause all roads you know all roads lead back to you
 Cigarette and TV set they don't keep me warm
 Now I see what I really need's what we had befor
 My restless sole took control like a hurricane
 And I'll never let you go if I ever get you back again
 I just want to find my way home
 I'd give everything that I own
 Now I see that I was so wrong
 Just to let you get away"

 Raise your hand together
 Take a stand together
 let's all try to win this fight"
889,Gorky Park,Try to Find Me,"When the rain is pouring down
And no one is around
All the doors are closed
You're a stranger in this town
Wandering around and you feel lost

[CHORUS:]
Please try to find me and I'll try to find you
You know I need you just like you need me
Please don't give up cause we're almost together
We've almost made it, hold on and you'll see

When nobody wants to hear
What you want to say
And you feel down when your hope has disappeared
Like a morning train
You can't slow down

[CHORUS:]
I'm just like you,
Oh you know it's true
Don't give up my friend
This is not the end

890,Great White,Afterglow (Of Your Love),"Your love
Love is all around me
Everywhere
Love has come to touch my soul
With someone who really cares
No one can deny us
People who once passed me by
Will turn their heads
I'm happy just to be with you
And lovin' you the way I do
Is everything I need to know
Just restin' in the afterglow (of your fire/love)

You
Yes, you have always been here
A feelin' deep inside
A feelin' that I could not see
Or touch, or try to hide
My love is in and without you
I bless the day that I found you
So listen baby
I'm happy just to be with you

Love is like a voice in my head
Keeps turning out (all) the things that we said
"
891,Great White,Again and Again,"Once upon a time not so very long ago
There wasn't such a thing as a rock 'n roll show
You had to sit at home and listen to the radio

Then came a man with a rockin' guitar
Found himself a beat and he played it near and far
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll

Again again again again, again again again again
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again
Again again again again, again again again again
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again

He travelled round the world in a rock n roll band
He stood there like a child with a guitar in his hand
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll

Nobody cared about the clothes he would wear
Nobody cared about the colour of his hair
Everybody came to see and let the good times roll

Again again again again, again again again again
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again
Again again again again, again again again again
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again

Now we got the rhythm, now we got the rock
Time didn't matter never living by the clock
Everybody came to hear him play his rock n roll

Then came a line when the music didn't rhyme
He couldn't find the rhythm cos he couldn't find the time
But still the people came to listen to the good times roll

Again again again again, again again again again
Why don't we do it, why don't we do it again
Again again again again, again again again again
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again

Again again again again, again again again again
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again
I said, why don't you do it, why don't you do it again "
892,Great White,Ain't No Shame,"Ain't no line, ain't no lyin' to love
Ain't no crime, Lord there ain't no cryin' to love
Yeah to love
Well you say your sick and tired of being lonely
And you say you've had enough of sympathy
And you find there's no one there to share your midnights
Well that just ain't the way it ought to be
And it ain't no shame

Ain't no shame to be loved
And you better believe it, 'cause when you're there
There's nothing else you'd ever want to do

Ain't no shame to be loved, can't you hear me
Look inside your heart'll tell you true
All my love belongs to you

To walk the path, the path of life alone, so alone
A single light in an empty sky, so alone
When it seems there's no one there to lend a shoulder
And your nights are cold and filled with misery
Well it's time you took a look a little closer
'Cause that's just ain't the way it ought to be
No, ain't no shame

Well you say you're sick and tired of being lonely
And your nights are cold and filled with misery
Well it's time you took a look a little closer, a little closer
'Cause that's just ain't the way it ought to be
No, ain't no shame

Ain't no shame to be loved
And you'd better believe it cause when you're there
There's nothing else you'd ever want to do
Ain't no shame to be loved
All my love belongs to you
Ain't no shame to be loved
Ain't no shame to be loved"
893,Great White,Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady,"I guess it was yourself you were involved with, 
I would've sworn it was me.
I might've found out sooner 
If you'd only let me close enough to see.
 
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way to treat your baby,
Your woman, your friend.  That ain't no way to treat a lady, 
No way, but maybe it's a way for us to end.
 
I was only bein' a picture, 
With all the colors, I know,
While you were busy lookin' into 
Wide blue mirrors and lovin' the show.
 
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way to treat your baby,
Your woman, your friend.  That ain't no way to treat a lady, 
No way, but maybe it's a way for us to end.
There's a funny kind of consolation keeping me sane,
And I'd really like to share it, crawl on deep in my brain;
And see the times you never felt me lovin' you or needin' you,
So leavin' you now, you still won't know how to feel the pain.
 
I was lookin' out for my happiness
While you were lookin' within
And before you knew your own reflection
Always starts to tire you, it's happened again.
 
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way to treat your baby,
Your woman, your friend.  That ain't no way to treat a lady, 
No way, but maybe it's a way for us to end."
894,Great White,All My Love,"Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end.
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
the tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?
* Chorus: All of my love, all of my love, All of my love to you. (repeat)
The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Aryan one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin
Chorus
Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
his is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind
Chorus"
895,Great White,All Over Now,"Woke up a little too rough
Looking like a quarter
When a dollar ain't enough
This room is just a mess
Nothing's ever working
And I couldn't care less
You know I ain't got no honey
Because I ain't got no money.
Broke up
No good bye
Now it's down to slumming
And living high and dry
So don't go comin' around
No more bringin' me down

There's nothin' left, baby
It's all over now
That's why, can't cry.
Now you've got a ticket
It's all over now

So tough, all her jive
""Need a lot of action just to keep it alive""
Blue moon
Love in June
Nothin' but a promise
Of trouble comin' soon
Ain't got a lover
Who ain't got another
Woke up, just enough
Give you all I oughta
But it never was enough
So don't go comin' around
No more bringin' me down

There's nothin' left, baby
It's all over now

She done me wrong, it's all over town
Now she's gone, her turn to cry"
896,Great White,All Right,"Grew up on promises
Tomorrow will be all right
Held on to my defenses
In fear of the night
Covered my worried head
As she turned out the light
And just as tomorrow comes
Again comes the night

The only comfort I received
All you can do is let it be
It's gonna be all right, uh-huh?
We'll make it through the night
It's gonna be all right
Took on an education
I learned to compete

It don't take no qualification
To sleep in the street
There's not much humanity
In this kind of race
How civil is competition
A foot on a face?

And at the time I still believed
A little more juice, I'll be free
It's gonna be all right, uh-huh?
It's gonna be all right, uh-huh?
We'll make it through the night
It's gonna be all right

Now as I take your hand
Show you the stars
Try to explain to you
Who we are

With so little expectation
In this manner of life
All of the complications
The fear in the night
Will you be able to believe
There will be love eventually

It's gonna be all right, uh-huh?
We'll make it through the night
It's gonna be all right"
897,Great White,Alone,"Tell me which way the wind blows
And of the song it sings
Tell me where did the time go n'
For who the bells ring
Baby, days are so empty now
No promises, no pain
I guess, I guess I realized
I overstayed my day

And I wonder now as I write this down
How it's gonna sound when I'm old
Did I learn to fly. Did I reach the sky
Am I goin' underground

But I know, I know
I can tell you pretty darlin'
What it means to be alone
I know, I know
I can tell you little darlin'
It's no good to be alone

Sometimes as the rain comes down
I feel it wash away my fears
And sometimes when the rain comes down
It's another veil of tears
And I wonder if I missed a turn
On the long and winding road
Did I lose my eyes. Did my radar die
Is it time to crash and burn
But I know, I know
I can tell you without lyin'
I don't want to be alone

And I know, I know
I know the sky is cryin'
And I don't want to be alone
And if I find you out there in the streets
Will you know me the moment our eyes meet
Will you find me. Will I know you
And I wonder if I missed a turn
On the long and winding road
Did I lose my eyes. Did my radar die
Am I gonna crash and burn

And I know, I know
I can tell you pretty darlin'
I don't want to be alone
I know, I know
I know the sky is cryin'
And I don't want to be alone"

You gotta have it and have it fine 
Don't say a word about her affections

Raised on the streets I know
To get what you want you gotta take control""
I'm on the run, bad boys
I'm on the loose, bad boys
I'm on my way. I've paid my dues
Pull of the trigger, time starts to crawl
Two lives have ended when the hammer falls
Raised on the streets I know
To get what you want you gotta take control

The lost years were long each night was cold
The way I felt? Feel the snow
I've done my time, paid what I owed
Don't want those walls of steel and stone

I put myself behind the wall
Now that I'm back
Ain't gonna fall"

Who you used to be
Did you become the stranger
Baby you or me

I guess you were just tryin'
To keep a love alive
But baby all your lyin'
Just took it for a ride

Huh huh!

A man of constant sorrow
Under an evil eye
Oh baby when it's over
The truth is first to die

Oh I believe in magic
Fire that binds a band
Baby there's no magic
In hidin' sleight of hand

I guess that I was tryin'
To keep myself alive
But then there's no denyin'
I was losin' all my pride

Trouble with the PTA

Daggers of dawn, cold hearted day
Why does if have to be morning?
Cover my head, stayin' in bed
Too late the luckless warning

Outside the screaming city
Red lights, hungry eyes
Sucks like a space invader
The vacuum of its lies
Stealin' my strength, stealin' my time
It's raining in a world of traders

Let me keep on sleeping
Forget that I'm alone
One day of faceless living-
is twenty-four hours too long
I don't want to face the day

Give me the night, it's more forgiving
Hold back the light from my eyes
Please stay invisible darkness
can't see the tears that I cry
I know it's comin', loaded with nothing
Trapped in a tunnel of time

I don't want to face the day

All looking for someone to be
I don't mind. I do fine
There's nowhere that I'd rather be
On a mainline
Fast road to nowhere
A straight line
Fast road to nowhere

Don't you cry, baby don't ask why
And what does this all mean to me
Sometimes it just seems to be
We all have need to break free
I don't mind. I do fine
There's nowhere that I'd rather be

On a mainline
The fast road to nowhere

Take me along for the ride of no return

Waitin' here on the likes o' you
My Thursday child
I'll face the music that I hear in my head
As the night rolls by
Song of a drifter lost to the road
Tryin' to reach for the sky

Gotta get on the road
Gotta long way to go
Gotta get on home
Gotta get on the road
Gotta long way to go
Gotta get on home

So nothin' lasts n' I can't change
Been this way too long
Love burns so fast when you see the flame
Ya gotta let it shine on
God only knows it's hard to find
Oh a place to belong
And as you grow to find your way
Ya have to move on
So I go my way like a shadow at night
Like a name on the wind
I'll sail away to an ocean of love
Oh let the tide roll in

Gotta get on the road
Gotta long way to go
Gotta get back home
Gotta get on the road
Gotta long way to go
Gotta get back home

Like a river runnin' outta the snow
Down to the ocean I'll go
Like a river with a soul of its own
I gotta let my love flow"
914,Great White,Gimme Some Lovin',"Well the temperature's rising, I've seen it before
Crazy people rockin' like they wanted some more
Let me in baby, I don't know what you've got
But you better take it easy, L.A.'s hot
I'm so glad we made, so glad we made it
You gotta gimme some lovin', gimme some love

Every day
Well I feel so good, everything is kinda high
Better take it easy because the place is on fire
Been a hard day, I had some work to do
We made it baby, it could happen to you
Been a hard day, nothing hurt too good
Gonna relax honey, everybody should
You gotta gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'"
915,Great White,Going to California,"Spent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems."
916,Great White,Gone With the Wind,"My heart is empty
Like cold open ground
Where ghosts & memories
Follow you round

Replacing old friends
No more to be found
All gone their ways
With the new stars in town

All of their laughter
Has drifted away
Gone with the wind
Like yesterday's song

Gone with the wind
Like yesterday's song
Gone
Gone with the wind

There's no sign of the lover
Who pins butterflies
No sign of fair-weather
No sweet soundin' lies

Now I'm a stranger
My eyes are set free
Like a man on a mountain
How I can see

All the ways
Illusions deceive
In a city of prayers
Where no one believes

When all of your dreams have scattered away
Gone with the wind
Like yesterday's song
Gone with the wind

Like yesterday's songs
Gone
Gone with the wind"
917,Great White,Gone to the Dogs,"I see the sun comin' yeah but I can't sleep
I swim against the tide until I'm drownin' in the deep end
Rushin' to the rhythm of a racin' heart
The more you get, the more you want
The more it takes to please you

I'm feelin' so alive
Only the truth to hide
Gone to the dogs, that's right
Gone to the dogs, that's what I say

Never had a lover keep a leash on me,
But keep that tail a-waggin 'till the next time I see ya
Dance under the moon 'til the mornin' light
Honey don't ya' fake me
Come on shake me baby, take me tonight 

I'm feelin' so alive
Only the truth to hide
Gone to the dogs, that's right
Gone to the dogs, that's what I say"
918,Great White,Gonna Getcha,"Slow blues can turn her on
But she's a whole lotta woman
When the band rocks on
Watch her move for the backstage door
The show may be over now
But she's gonna get some more

She says
I know what I want
I know just what I need

She says
You got nowhere to run
I'm gonna get you
You got nowhere to hide
I'm gonna getcha
Get you down

Now it's late but she don't care
We got a whole lotta waiting
Till we can make it next year
She knows, she knows it's hit and run
But she wants to ride a rocket
Into the midnight sun

She says
You got nowhere to run
I'm gonna get you
You got nowhere to hide
I'm gonna getcha
Get you down

She says
You got nowhere to run
I'm gonna getcha

She gets what she wants
She gets just what she needs"
919,Great White,Heart the Hunter,"had a woman, gave her all of my lovin' 
Gave her all that I had 
Kinda' woman she could make you believe her 
Nothing's gonna go bad 

Took awhile, and all the hurtin' 
Since she left and went away 
Behind her smile though I can't be certain 
But I thought I heard her say 

My heart's a hunter 
And love is a loser's game 
My heart's a hunter 
And love is a loser's game 

Little baby I won't give ya no heartaches 
I won't give ya no pain 
Sweet little darlin' can't ya see what is comin' 
Cause ya know me by name 

Used to be when I was a child 
I thought lovin' should be free 
And it's so hard to be reconciled 
That ain't the way it oughta be 

It's only lovin' when she's gone and she's left ya 
It goes to show it's always something 
That I felt when I met ya 
It comes and it goes 

I ride alone tonight 
So bittersweet 
I took a chance 
I tried to love her 
Someone whispered her name 
Heartbreaker"
920,Great White,Heartbreaker,"So outta reach so far away
Another's woman and can't keep away
Can't be alone wastin' all of my time
I'm in pain, I'm in heartache
It's gonna end up in a heartbreak
And no one knows how to make it alright
I've seen love before
I can't take this anymore
Someone's losin' her heart

She's got the lovin' that gives me peace of mind
I'm still here waitin' for her to see the light
It would be so good, be so fine
Give me the love that you know is mine
It would be so good, be so fine
Let me know when your heart is mine
To love a brother, to love another
To have a friend you can count on forever
How can you tell him his lovin' is mine
She's got the lovin' that gives me peace of mind
I'm still waitin' for her to see the light
Search my soul

T'find out wrong from right
All I know
I'm alone tonight
I know I outta try to leave it
I know I should
But my heart needs to keep her
I got to tell her

921,Great White,Hey Mister,"Lookin' back there's nothin' left to say
Wishin' that this life would slowly fade away
Dreams behind these eyes, no one could know, oh oh
But wake to find there's nowhere left to go

Hey Mister can't you see I'm feelin' so alone?
But then I don't think you'd understand
All I ever wanted was to live life unafraid
All I ever needed was some love

Stories told on weary cardboard signs
Eulogize the lives now left behind
Faces worn and etched with all despair
Passers by, they look but seldom care

Hey Mister can't you see the ring around the moon?
Maybe it's the water in my eyes
All I ever wanted was to live life unashamed
All I ever needed was some love

Livin' on the edge of sanity
Wonderin' how this ever came to be
Feelin' so unnecessary, gotta find some sanctuary
Hey buddy can you spare a dime?

Hey Mister can't you see I'm feelin' so abused?
But really, I don't think you'd understand
All I ever wanted was to live life, what I mean is
All I ever needed was someone
Hey Mister can't you see I'm just a man like you?
Who's tryin' hard to keep his dignity
Maybe if you could just walk a mile inside my shoes
You'd see that I just need a helping hand
Hey Mister please, hey Mister please, beggin' on my knees
Can anybody help me find my way?"
922,Great White,Hiway Nights,"I know the spell you're under 
I know it so well

No way to tell 

I've traveled miles from nowhere 
Where sons never rise 
Lookin' to find a meaning 
Now open your eyes 

Yeah 
Been this way so long 
Tomorrow's gone

Chasing the wind 
Look for a change of season 
Somewhere to begin

Can't find no ""easy solution""
But I'll try, to make it all that I need

Don't say die
Gotta hold on
Gotta hold on one more
Gotta hold on
Gotta hold on one more
One more day
Been around. I've seen it all

And though no one else could blame me
There were signs I should of recognized

When the night falls and she's leavin'
Oh the moon shines cold and gray
Hear my heartbeat yeah yeah hear m' weepin'
Pain and sorrow's here to stay

I begged you baby help me
But you turned your back on me

Trying to find someone alive

Do you hear me?
Is anybody there

Standing in the darkness
A trouble mind talking to myself
So long alone, is it a dream
Sidewalks cold and lonely
The shadows of the night begin to fade
Open my eyes, nobody's there

Still I'm looking, reaching out again
Trying to find someone alive

Do you hear me?"

Of everyone I never met

Love is only a lie
Only a lie, only a lie

And calculation cold
This bird of avarice
Has left me now I know

Love is only a lie
Only a lie, only a lie

Oh silent night come now to me
And if I dream of light come down
And be with me and in the dark we will not see

935,Great White,Loveless Age,"When I was younger, trusted fate to pave the way
Love was so easy, just a game that children play
No time-out for changes, all my days are darkened dreams
Now there ain't nothin' and nothin's what it seems

You know heartache comes full circle yeah
Has the past returned again, again

I'm upside down
I don't understand you anymore
Is it somebody else I see walkin' through my door
No more lies on the table, no more pictures on the wall
Feel like I'm livin' in a loveless age

Night brings no comfort, a rider on the storm
Lookin' for reason in the face of destiny
'Cause faith has no meaning in a broken dream
Where there ain't no one, and no one's who they seem

You know heartache comes full circle
And the scars on the soul never fade

Feel like I'm livin' in a loveless age

I don't want you, what I need
Is the touch of a woman
Who won't try to make me bleed
Maybe I'm crazy, yeah baby that's me
No, no, no, no, no don't go draggin' me down
And then leave me to drown in this loveless age

Feel like I'm livin' in a loveless age
Feel like I'm livin'

No more, no more in a loveless age"

Set it on the wall
Let the wax like teardrops fall

I used to dream on baby
Dream that we could have it all
I see now love for you
Was what you had to do
You change your mind
Like you change your dress

I thought I knew you everyway
Saw the child, the woman plain as day
I thought I knew myself
But now I come to find
Love is blind and I'm the lovin' kind

Bought a diamond and I
Set it on your hand
Introduced you to the band
And now I hear them say
You've been a bad girl baby
You don't seem to understand
Just for the social whirl
You play the party girl
Now you drink your wine
Oh baby time to forget

You made a game of love
What were you thinkin' of
It takes a heartbeat baby
To say goodbye"

I've had the blues for you so long
I've been down, I've been confused

One that I can use

Promises fade like the dreams of the night
My old love, you don't come no more
Bring me lovin' baby, like you did before
Was it the time

Was it someone on your mind
Was it just love for awhile
Maybe someday when the hurtin' is gone
Baby someday love will stay on
Maybe someday we will do no wrong
I know we can make it alright babe if we try
Maybe someday

I've been thinkin' darlin'
Of all the times before
When I needed lovin'
Why did it walk right out the door
Do I hold you too hard baby
Jealous you don't stay
I guess that's lovin' you darlin'
Is it the time

Is there someone on my mind
Is it love once in awhile
Maybe someday the need will be gone
Maybe someday I'll find to move on
Maybe someday there's a way to belong
Maybe I'll find it today
Baby our way
Maybe someday"

With open arms they shelter me, and bring me home to them.
And we're miles away, always miles away.
Rollin' on down the highway, livin' for the day;
Seems I'm always miles away.

Just outside of Memphis, where Rock 'n Roll began,
We say a prayer for Elvis, then on the road again.
The mind begins to wander, as memories unfold
The music on the radio reminds us of our homes.

Sometimes it seems the road will never end,
Sometimes it seems my only friend yeah, yeah, yeah.
What will tomorrow tell, I just can't say today,
Because I'm always miles away, miles away.

The boy I left at home took his first steps today
I'll watch him on the video before I leave to play.
'Cause we're miles away, always miles away.
Rollin' on down the highway, livin' for the day
Seems I'm always miles and miles away,
Always miles away.

Oh yeah, all of my life is rollin', livin' just to play,
Seems I'm always miles away, yeah,
Seems I'm always miles away,
Seems I'm always miles away, miles away."
939,Great White,Mista Bone,"That girl is just a cool good looker
That baby's sweeter than raw brown sugar
Never mind cause the fancy took her
She says she wants to let the small head rock her

What a smile
Don't it drive you insane
Ooh ma baby
Drive a mile
Just to ride back again

Baby won't ya rock it tonight

And when she's in the mood
When she needs that lovin' groove
When she wants it rude
She grooves with Mista Bone
If she's in the mood
If she hits that lovin' groove
When she's gettin' rude
She grooves with Mista Bone

Just take it like a sweet injection
Just a token of my affection
Another night we'll take another direction
I'm gonna play you like a rhythm section

What style
Let me see that again
Ooh my baby
Drive a mile
Just to ride you again

Baby won't ya rock it tonight 

And when she's in the mood
When she needs that lovin' groove
When she wants it rude

940,Great White,Mistreater,"Somethin' bout the way she walks
The way she wears her hair
Somethin' bout the way she talks
She makes her meaning clear
Animal grace, the angel face
She gets it all for free
You'll be sorry. Believe it
She used to put that on for me

Fire's in her eyes but eyes can lie
Blinded by the light of the stars

She's a mean mistreater
But you just can't leave her alone
She's a mean mistreater
And you just can't leave her alone

We came to town in seventy-five
From somewhere way back east
Whole lot more to staying alive
Than they tell you 'bout down on main street
Took our place, lost in space
Two more dreamers in town
You know the story. Believe it
And now she chooses cold company

Fire's in her eyes but her eyes lie
Listen mister take it from me

She's a mean mistreater
A stone trick teaser"
941,Great White,Momma Don't Stop,"Well, I never thought I'd see you back
On my side of the railroad tracks
Just blown in from Tokyo

You're lookin' for some kid to sign
Catchin' jive off the grapevine
""Billboard's"" runnin' a picture next week
""Hits"" applauds you on your winnin' streak

There's always someone else on the phone
So momma don't stop your rock n' roll
You might just find your heart has gone cold
Momma don't stop your rock n' roll

All day long
I'm real impressed with the things that you've done
Look how far this lady has come
Used to be so quiet and sweet
Now your name's all over the street
Used to charge it by the hour
Now you own an apartment tower
It's a shame about your former friends
Everyone now is a means to an end
Never mind you're livin' alone
It's hard to get a scratch on the lovin' jones
So momma don't stop your rock n' roll
You might just find your little lost soul
Momma don't stop your rock n' roll

All night long
It's so hard to be a woman today
To get what you deserve
It's not easy when you work this way
You have to keep a distant reserve
So momma don't stop your rock n' roll
You might just find your heart has gone cold
So momma don't stop your rock n' roll
All night long"

Oh, don't look anymore
There's only stillness
No more air can he draw
No time to say goodbye
No last little kiss
No life where bullets fly
And now it comes to this
What's left in her world
The child's gone
Softly she whispers
Where did I go wrong
My future, my baby
Tell me what's goin' on
No light in mother's eyes
Nothing you can say
No reason for the whys
She'll ask every day
What's left for the world
The child's gone"

This scene's gettin' old
Don't you think it's time we got to go

I got so twisted
Tryin' to make it right

I was told to use my head
Be herd and never scene
It's Daddy's double talk
Don't mean nothing to me

Let's move it
Time to say so long
Let's move it
Let's get this mother on

Hey little sister
In your high heeled shoes
Don't you know it's time to learn the blues

Sweet little sister
Time to get it on
Don't you know the meanin' to this song

I recall what Daddy said
Stay where you belong
That's just an alibi

Let's get this baby on

Let's move it
Time to say so long
Let's move it

Shake it from the family tree

945,Great White,Never Change Heart,"Howling night of bitter winds
This old house is burnin'
Reasons why forever retold
And no one is learning

I stand in the strange light
In a world with no eyes
Miss a turn in the midnight rain
Never come this way again

When loves light deserts you
Never change your heart
When lightning strikes and love is gone
Don't let it break your heart

Don't let it turn you 'round
So people mistake you
This worlds gonna still burn down
No matter what it comes to

When loves light deserts you
Never change your heart
When lightning strikes and love is gone
Don't let it break your heart

Return what you're given
Then be on your way
Move on. Be strong
You gotta carry on
Never change your heart!"
946,Great White,Never Trust a Pretty Face,"Ya leave home 'cause' it brings ya down
There's no attention from a sleepy Midwest town
Make ya way to the center stage
A spotlight makes it justifiable rage
It's reinvention as celebrity
Don't touch, just look at me
Oh no, never trust a pretty face
Oh no, never trust a pretty face
You said baby put your trust in me
When darkness fall I will always help you see

Stole the key from tomorrow's door
You had all but you only wanted more
Sold your soul for the company
You went and took advantage of me
Oh no, never trust a pretty face
Oh no, never trust a pretty face
A silent face in a magazine
You learn how to lie as you sell the world a dream

Listen now for the drop of a name
A steppin' stone on the stairway to fame
I only saw what I wanted to see
I let my heart make a fool outta me
Oh no, never trust a pretty face
Oh no, never trust a pretty face"
947,Great White,Nightmares,"Got a head full of fever
My body's wracked with pain
Staring into blackness
Somethings waiting there for me
Try to hold to my senses
But darkness has its hand on me
Stripping back the covers leavin'
A bed of doubt and agony
It's in the shadows
Waiting

Nightmares
Parasites sucking on my veins
Unholy fears are coming true
I wish I could sleep
In the silent deep
And escape this insanity"
948,Great White,No Better Than Hell,"Closing your eyes to the truth that surrounds you
Won't make life easy to take
Filling your heart with the hate that inflames you
Just makes it burn out and break.
Want someone to love you? Want someone to care?
Want someone there by your side?

But you're building walls of plaster, building walls of bone
Now there's nowhere left to hide
No better than hell, no, the way that you feel
No better than hell, no, the way that you are
Waiting all time for a soul to embrace you
Just makes you lonely and old
Turning your back on the lover who needs you
Turns the world slowly and cold
Want someone to love you? Want someone to care?
Want someone there by your side?

But you're living off disaster, living on your own
While everyone's taking their sides
No better than hell, no, the way that you feel
No better than hell, no, the way that you are
Want someone to love you? Want someone to care?
Want someone there for a friend
But you're burning all your bridges, burning down your home
Burning the wax at both ends
No better than hell, no, the way that you feel
No better than hell, no, the way that you are
No better than hell, no, the way that you feel
No better than hell, no, the way that you are
No!"

Ooh girl, with you
No matter what you do
I will always be around
Won't you tell me what you found, girl
Ooh girl, want you
Knock down the old, grey wall
Be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
As I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be
No matter where you go
There would always be a place
Can't you see it in my face, girl
Ooh girl, want you

950,Great White,No Quarter,"Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
Walking side by side with death, the devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow, the dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through, to build a dream for me and you
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter. They ask no quarter
The pain, the pain without quarter
They ask no quarter
The dogs of doom are howling more!"

Ah no don't go
Down to the midnight motel
Oh no so low
Can't find no heaven in hell

There's a silence that comes in the morning
Leaves you screamin' at the wall
As you sit there in your easy chair
Chasin' demons at a crawl

When you feel that you'll never find
Somewhere why'll be safe to lie
Just take a look over here
Together we'll rise in a mornin' glory

Anything you want
Anything you want

Everything you want

953,Great White,On the Edge,"I been hanging my life from a frayed tight wire
I been walkin' thin ice with my heels on fire
Keep racing my heart so the beat won't miss me
Still wanting a night when the stars will kiss me

I got too much time
I don't know who's alive
Never satisfied
Livin' on the edge
The edge of time
Waiting for a perfect crime
Livin' on the edge

Everyone I see's got the cool cold shoulder
Just hangin' around gettin' slow and older
Like a little girl suckin' chemical cola
Strung out on lies that the T.V. sold her

Edge of time"

I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world

And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
The heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda  beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Halfway home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was givin' what she got

I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby

Oh, woman you're a mess, gonna die in your sleep
There's  blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messin' around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet

I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby

Alright!  I didn't know you had a rock and roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's as dark as it's gone

I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby

Out of the night, I've got to have your love

I'm a reckless outlaw, a renegade by trade

Rockin' all over the night, I was rollin' stoned
Stoned, stoned, stoned, yeah
Sippin' down, shoutin' 'bout
Yeah we used to shake it out
Rich is building houses, Gary's doing hard time
Brently bought a gun
Where did all the days go
Rollin' stoned, I was rollin' stoned

963,Great White,Sail Away,"Adrift out on an open sea
A life raft seekin' company
Sailing on a sea insane
Rolling with the waves of pain
Chance determines destiny
Tide can be the enemy
When the moon is shining bright
It hangs there like a beacon light
You're looking for a place to stay
A place to leave another day
Water leaves no trace behind
Of all the ways your life unwinds

So sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

As you come you come alone
All you are is what you know
Dependent on your memory
Remember who you used to be
Reason is a raging wind
Beating on your weathered skin
Confusion is the tidal flow
Pulls you like an undertow
Adrift out on a sea of tears
Navigating by your fears
Searching in the stars above
A way to find your isles of love

So sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
A sea of faces flow by me
Islands of identity
Isolated constantly
No ones's where he ought to be

So sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away"
964,Great White,Saint Lorraine,"Sometimes I wonder how I'm goin' to pay the rent
All I do is work my fingers to the bone
No time to rest, no doubt I think I'm a fool

I used to think I couldn't get out of this
Stuck in a race car out of control
Man I was doin' 'bout 105, then I met you
And then I blinked
Oh yeah taught me to think
I owe it all to you

My my rain
You got me singin' along to the radio
You nailed my brain
I call you Saint Lorraine

You put out the trash, cleaned up my living room
Took me to bed, now I'll never be the same
Brought out the man that must have been hidin' 

Yeah there's two kinds of lovers
One that takes and one that gives
Sometimes I shudder thinkin' how I've been used
I found my rhythm, you'll never catch me singing no blues
Oh no
Sometimes I think 'bout how you caught me with a wink
I give it all to you

My my rain, you got me rockin' along
I'll never let you go
You took my pain
I call you Saint Lorraine
Yes I do, yes I do
Oh then you caught me with a wink
I'll never let you go
I, I, I, oh I'm rockin' all night long

Sometimes I wonder how I'm going to pay the rent
I used to think I'll never get out of this
And then I blinked and you took me out of that

Thank you very much Lorraine
You got me rockin' along
I'll never let you go
You took my pain
I call you Saint Lorraine"
965,Great White,Save Your Love,"I wake in the night
To find you on my mind
Deep in a dream,
You'll always be
Until the end of time
I look in your eyes
They touch my soul
My love is hard to hide
I'm never alone when we're apart.
I feel you by my side

And here in my heart,
Where no one else will ever be
I know who you are,
So lock the door and throw away the key
Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night,
You're all I see

I wake from a dream
And see you by my side
How could I belong to someone else,
When holdin' you feels so right?
And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
We've made it so far,
So lock the door and throw away the key

Save all your love
Save all your love for me

Save your love,
Save all your love
Save all your love"
966,Great White,She Only,"So many years go by
So many tears can fill your eyes
So many fears to lock behind a door

So you drift away
And yet another day
Day goes by
Empty as before

I'll be there
Come the mornin' light
Waitin' there
I'll wait for you

She only needs someone
She only needs some time
She only needs someone
To stay this time
She's waiting for love to come
She waits there on her own
she's waitin' for someone
To get it right this time

So many days drift by
Too many ways to slowly die
How may shadows fade across a wall

Soon the day will come
You may find someone
Only now
Lonely evermore

She's still there
Come the morning light
She's waiting there
She waits for you

She only needs someone"
967,Great White,She Shakes Me,"Look in my eyes, my pupils are shot
I'm runnin' fever
Taken to drink and whatever you've got
I can't believe it
Masquerade ace in Hollywood hair
You've got my brains fried
Watchin' you move, having you near
I just can't breath right
But, Oh! Why should we have a reason?
Why hide it! Can't fight it
No longer got control
She shakes me
She shakes me
Built to ride, a cruiser that glides
She's just a woman
The look in her eye, the sound of a sigh
She loves a warm gun
She's mine and she really gets me off
So fine and she really gets me off
She shakes me"
968,Great White,Shot in the Dark,"I have learned the golden words
""You watch your step""
That life is made for fools
And the devil takes the rest
I know my heart is like a fire
It burns alone

I come from somewhere else
Where grapes of rock are grown
Call me a shot in the dark
Firing blind, firing wild
Just like a shot in the dark
You'll never see- no stopping me
I'm a shot in the dark
So I live in other days
I take my time

I make my way down streets
Where no one sees the signs
Can I learn the simple truth
Face the fact

No matter where I am
I can never go back
'Cause I'm a shot in the dark
I shoot out from the black
I never can go back
Forever changing tracks
I'm a shot in the dark"
969,Great White,Silent Night,"Every now and then I like to pick up the phone
And make a call down memory lane
Well how you been, well baby you could say I've been lonely too
I've been pickin' up the pieces ever since the day
I left you sleeping on the motel road
I heard you had two kids, got married, it was quite the show
You're my one stone true regret
As I'm lyin' alone in my bed

On this silent night
I say a little prayer for you on this silent night
I send this message through, I was wrong to run
Shoulda took a little time for life
'Cause loneliness is no repayment for sacrifice
I'm doin' time in paradise on this silent night

I remember how we touched, we were young in love
Didn't know what was wrong or right
We just stuck to each other like the earth sticks to the sun

You taught me how to laugh, I learned how to cry
It was easy as one, two, three
We were lucky and wild back then, just happy to be
Now I think about you with desire, and my heart's still full of fire

On this silent night
I say a little prayer for you on this silent night
I send this message through, I was wrong to run
Shoulda took a little time for life
'Cause loneliness is no repayment for sacrifice
I'm doin' time in paradise on this silent night

In my mind I see the wind blow through your hair
I have a photograph of you and I somewhere
Painting pictures of the life that we would share

I wear this badge of sorrow, but how was I to know
I found the truth comes easy when you live in the light
I guess it only goes to show
So you think I'm crazy 'cause I feel this way
Gonna pick myself up off the ground and I'll turn it around

On this silent night
I say a little prayer for you on this silent night
I send this message through, I was wrong to run
Shoulda took a little time for life
'Cause loneliness is no repayment for sacrifice
I'm doin' time in paradise on this silent night

I guess it's time to say good-bye, on this silent night"

I'm going in to sin city
I'm gonna win in sin city
The lights are bright
Through the town tonight

I'm gonna win in sin city
Ladders and snakes
Ladders give, snakes take
Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief
Ain't got a hope in hell, that's my belief

And roll those loaded dice
Bring on the dancing girls
And put the champaign on ice"
971,Great White,Since I've Been Loving You,"Working from seven to eleven every night,
It really makes life a drag, I don't think that's right.

'Cause I love you, baby, How I love you, darling, How I love you, baby,

How I love you, girl, little girl.
But baby, Since I've Been Loving You. I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh, yeah.
Everybody trying to tell me that you didn't mean me no good.
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you, Let me tell you I really did the best I could.
I've been working from seven to eleven every night, I said It kinda makes my life a drag.

Lord, that ain't right...
Since I've Been Loving You, I'm about to lose my worried mind.
Said I've been crying, my tears they fell like rain,
Don't you hear, Don't you hear them falling,
Don't you hear, Don't you hear them falling.

Do you remember mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me you didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, hear my back door slam,

You must have one of them new fangled back door man.
I've been working from seven, seven, seven, to eleven every night, It kinda makes my life a drag...
Baby, Since I've Been Loving You, I'm about to lose, I'm about lose to my worried mind."

Let the fire be the only light
Draw the curtain, pull down the shade
In easy arms we'll lay

So come on lady now close your eyes
Let the madness pass on by
Loosen up your golden hair
Stroke away my every care

There's no comfort in strangers
That I can't find right here

Layin' down in the arms of Sister Mary
Will her lovin' ever last?
Layin' down in the arms of Mother Mary

Pure and silent like a star above
Never mind 'bout tomorrow's fears
Piece of mind is here
Outside's a world of strangers
So I will stay right here

Layin' down in the arms of Sister Mary
Will her lovin' ever last?
Layin' down in the arms of Mother Mary
Nothin' more to ask

Let her lovin' come to you

Oh her love will come to you and bring you home, yeah

Outside's a world of strangeness
So I will stay right here"
973,Great White,South Bay Cities,"'Bye New York, so long Philly
Hollywood your Wacko City
Chicago got just too damn windy for me
Frisco's fine apart from that line
New Orleans is just a good time
And southern belles can certainly ring my chimes
But my feet are achin' to feel the sand
Of the Golden Towns
We call 'em
South Bay Cities
Only place I call my home
South Bay Cities
Sweetest life I've ever known
If you can't find me baby
That breeze has gone and blown me home

Big old sun and cool sea breezes
Roller girls ain't no teases
I know she'll do just what she pleases for me
Ain't no stoppin' The Raintree Rockin'
After hours one stop shoppin'
And Blotzers always totally out of his mind
And my dream is sleepin' in the arms
Of those Golden Towns"
974,Great White,Stairway to Heaven,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who standing looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.
And she's buying a stairway to heaven."
975,Great White,Step on You,"Brown skinned woman's been trading rough
Scars across her thigh
Tell me little honey

To the kings of Hollywood

Her fascination
Ride the wild side
She's so bad
Wild soul

Your explanation
Isn't gonna change my mind

A caution to the wise

Who'll make his bones feel old

From all the ties that bind

You can the music and stop all the noise,
Or you can get out and find your own way!""
I told him ""Stick it."" My rock's here to stay.
No. No. I can't live without it
No. No. It just ain't the same
No. No. Ain't no doubt about it
So rock me again!
I want to roll it and burn it all night
Me and my Chevy don't stop for no lights
Crankin' the metal, blastin' the plant
They want to catch me, betcha they can't!
I'm out on the road, and I'm rockin'!

The hours, they bring me pain.

[Chorus]
Tangerine, Tangerine, Living reflection from a dream;

I was her love, she was my queen, And now a thousand years between.
Thinking how it used to be, Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again? And I do.

[Chorus]"
978,Great White,Thank You,"If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me
Kind woman, I give you my all, kind woman, nothing more
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die. My, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look...see
And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad, happiness...I'm glad
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me"
979,Great White,The Angel Song,"Fallen angel ripped and bruised
Think on better days
Life is rude, treats you bad
Tears your wings away
Raise your eyes to star and sky
Believe in fly always
Take your dreams, your broken schemes
And sweep the past away

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

Hollywood ain't paved with gold
It's just a trick of light
Sunset falls on stars of old
And blinds you with its light
A spiders web of tangled lives
Lays stretched across the hills
From distances it's glistening
Like El Dorado's halls

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

The dream was light
And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scared
Where only fools find gold

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

Fly lonely angel
Spread your wings another way
Fly lonely angel
Find a better way
A better day"
980,Great White,The Immigrant Song,"Ah~ah~ahhh-ah!.
Ah~ah~ahhh-ah!.
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.

Hammer of the Gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, and sing and cry:
""Valhalla I am coming."";

On we sweep with, with threshing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.
Ah~ah~ahhh-ah!.
Ah~ah~ahhh-ah!.

An' we come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore,

Of how we calmed the tides of war.
We are your overlords.
On we sweep with threshing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

So now you better stop
And rebuild all your ruins.
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing.

Ooh~ooh. Ooh~ooh. Ooh~ooh.
Ooh~ooh. Ooh~ooh. Ooh~ooh.
Ah hah hah hah hah hah.

Ooh~ooh. Ooh~ooh. Ooh~ooh.
Ooh~ooh. Ooh~ooh. Ooh~ooh.

Got no time for a rock 'n roll lover
You strut around like the original Queen of Sheeba
To I love you, you reply with, ""See ya""

But this is how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I know you won't come easily
But you're gonna give your love to me

This is how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I know your life is runnin' free
But you're gonna give your love to me

You got that face for a part in a devil's dream
You got that shape from a deal with a voodoo fiend
One of a kind, there surely ain't no other
Oh, don't you see we're made for one another ?

982,Great White,The Rover,"I've been to London, seen seven wonders. I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it. I always knew what it was for.
There can be no denyin' that the wind 'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flyin'. There's a new plague on the land
If we could just join hands (X3)
Traversed the planet when heaven sent me. I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight. I hear the rested rivers call
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe
If we could just join hands (X3)
You got me rockin' when I ought to be a-rollin'
Darlin', tell me, darlin', which way to go
You keep me rockin', baby, then you keep me stolen
Won't you tell me, darlin', which way to go... that's right
Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry and I would dearly like to know
I've all this wonder of earthly plunder will it leave us anything to show
And our time is flyin' see the candle burnin' low
Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old
If we could just join hands."

984,Great White,Waiting for Love,"Every day I wake to find
Empty arms, shuttered blinds
No one holding to my side
Laying in my lonely bed
Confused about the things we said
Nothing straight in my mind
I can't stand waiting, anticipating
Being here without you
I'm waiting for love
Just waiting for love

A prisoner in an ivory tower
Stranded in my darkest hour
On a broken bridge of sighs
If it's true that love has lied
If it's true my heart will cry
No one else can make it right
If I could only see you
My heart will always need you
Here I stand, heart in hand for you
I'm waiting for love"
985,Great White,Wasted Rock Ranger,"Well I'm a wasted rock ranger
I live the life of danger
On the road to find a higher high
I don't need no one's affection
All I need is my injection
An out-of-tune Les Paul'll get me by 

I've been doin' gigs since I was ten
I really can't remember when
I ever had a dollar to my name
My ears are blown, my eyes are red
I got big holes inside my head
Snorting too much crystal and cocaine

I have bennies with the breakfast toast
Qualudes with the evening roast
Assorted snorts of powder in between
I don't think a day's gone by
That I wasn't drunk or high
It's the only way I keep my sanity

From Kegger's Den to Hooterville
My flaming tricks have topped the bill
A thousand empty bottles earn my name
Endless trains of one night stands
Sharing gigs with half-assed bands
And all the local groupies lay the same

Well I could have had a payin' job
Workin' for some fucked-up slob
Wife and family, true security
But I left that shit behind
For that heavy metal grind
'Cause rock'n roll is in my blood to stay
(among other things)

Hey! You're a wasted rock ranger
You'll live life of danger
Sing this song and follow it till the end
When you reach number one
You can overdose for fun
And go and visit Jimi and his friends

Hey! You're a wasted rock ranger
You'll live a life of danger
Sing this song and follow it till the end
When we reach number one
Hey! We'll all overdose for fun
And we'll hang out with Jimi and his friends
Yee haw!"

When The Levee Breaks I'll have no place to stay.
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan, (X2)
Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home,
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.
Don't it make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home,
You don't know which way to go?
If you're goin' down South
They go no work to do,
If you don't know about Chicago.
Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move.
All last night sat on the levee and moaned, (X2)

Wooden Jesus shows the way
He keeps me ready for that judgement day
He's my wooden Jesus forgivin' me

I need a savior, so I try to believe
In my wooden Jesus doesn't mind
He always loves me
He's my kind of wooden Jesus
Wooden Jesus yeah, wooden Jesus

Ten thousand, maybe more
Wrapped with string on a cheap old board

Yet been through now.
We've healed the scars that got their start
Inside someone like you now.

Well had I known or I'd been shown back
When I longed you'd take me.
To break the charge that brought me home
And all that won't erase me.

I never would know that I could
No matter what you'd pay me.
Replay the part, you stole my heart
I should have known you're crazy.

If all I knew was that with you
I'd want someone to save me.
It'd be enough, but just my luck,
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was

Now I know you better,
You know I'd know better,
Now I know you better!

So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution,
This melody inside of me still searches for solution,
A twist of fate, a change of heart,
Kills my infatuation,
A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,

Bites the hand that feeds

It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
Never change

I met an old cowboy
I saw the look in his eyes
Somethin' tells me he's been here before
'Cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child
When the thought first came to me
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son
That brought back the devil in me

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
Never change

I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
Still wet behind the ears
I been around this track a couple o' times
But now the dust is startin' to clear
Oh yeah!!!

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
Ooh yeah, I'd be smilin'
No way I'd be smilin'
Ooh smilin'"

I've been there before

And don't you know

Don't you cry tonight
I still love you baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight

Give me a whisper
And give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you
tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinkin' of you
And the times we had, baby

And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight

And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
how I felt inside now honey
You gotta make it your own way
But you'll be alright now sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light now baby

1004,Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Don't damn me
When I speak a piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me

Be it a song or a casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks
Of quiet reservations
Your words once heard
They can place you in a faction
My words may disturb
But at least there's a reaction

Sometimes I want to kill
Sometimes I want to die
Sometimes I want to destroy
Sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I could get even
Sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give
Sometimes I never give a fuck

It's only for a while
I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen
Didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world
I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely
I fell down when I was blind

But don't damn me when I speak
A piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me

How can I ever satisfy you
An how can I ever make you see
That, deep inside we're all somebody
An it don't matter who you want to be
But now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend
For this man can say it happened
'Cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped into your world
I kicked you in the mind
An I'm the only witness
To the nature of my crime

But look at what we've done
To the innocent and young
Whoa listen to who's talking
'Cause we're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes
And dumped into the brain
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts
You tell me who's to blame

I know you don't want to hear me crying
An I know you don't want to hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions
But your delusions are yours an not mine
We take for granted that we know the whole story
We judge a book by it's cover
And read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me
An don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my attentions
Can you find the missing link
Your only validation is in living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I've never pretended
As so many others do intending just to please
If I damned your point of view
Could you turn the other cheek

Don't damn me when I speak a piece a mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
Put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me
Don't damn me
I said don't damn me
I said don't hail me
Ah, don't damn me"

1006,Guns N' Roses,Down on the Farm,"All I need is some inspiration
Before I do somebody some harm
I feel just like a vegetable
Down here on the farm

Nobody comes to see me
Nobody here to turn me on
I ain't even got a lover
Down here on the farm

They told me to get healthy
They told me to get some sun
But boredom eats me like ketchup
Down here on the farm

Drinking lemonade shanty
Ain't no body gonna do me harm
But I'm like a fish out of water
Down here on the farm

I write a thousand letters
'Til my fingers all gone numb
But I never see no postman
Down here on the farm

I call my baby on the telephone
I say come down and have some fun
But she knows what the score is
Down here on the farm

I can't fall in love with a wheat field
I can't fall in love with a barn
When everything smells like horse shit
Down here on the farm

Blue skies and swimming pools
Add so much charm
But I'd rather be back in Soho
Than down here on the farm

On the fucking farm!

Are you born in a fucking barn or what?

Baaaaaa!"

That's the way

That's all right

Sometimes these things they are so easy
Sometimes these things they are so cold
Sometimes these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no man don't let 'em get ta you

She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister
She said O.K.
An that's all right
Buried her things today
Way back out deep
Behind the driveway
And that's all right

Sometimes these women are so easy
Sometimes these women are so cold
Sometimes these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let 'em get to you

Ya get out on your own
And you/take all that you own
And you/forget about your home
And then you're/just fuckin' gone

There's no logic here today
Do as you got to, go your own way

We are just

How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to you baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

Old at heart but I'm only twenty eight
And I'm much too young
To let love break my heart
Young at heart but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart

I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
An what more could you ask from me
How could you say that I never needed you
When you took everything
Said you took everything from me

Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

Still talkin' to myself
And nobody's home

So nobody ever told us baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see

When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way
Find another day
With all the changing seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
An now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
You're back down on the ground

And you don't talk so loud
An you don't walk so proud
Any more, and what for

Well I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone
If it doesn't show give it time
To read between the lines

'Cause I see the storm getting closer
And the waves they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die

I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through, this time - oh this time
Without you
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die"

And that's the truth, and here's the worst yet

1018,Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend
And our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you
Or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give
I bought me an illusion
An I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
And I had to have them all
But oh the taste is never so sweet
As what you'd believe it is -
Well I guess it never is
It's these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood
To the heart of the biz

You know I never thought
That it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me
But it feels as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world
And in my songs
So now I've closed the door
To keep the cold outside
Seems somehow I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you
Or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive

Sweetness is a virtue
And you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you
But my conscience always tells me no
You could sell your body on the street
To anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside
And bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
No

Gonna have some fun with my frustrations
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour
'cause this road ain't gettin' clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy for he's a man
Sweetheart don't make me laugh
You's gettin' too big for your pants
And I's think maybe you should
Cut out while you can
You can use your illusion -
Let it take you where it may
We live and learn
And then sometimes it's best to walk away
Me I'm just here hangin' on
It's my only place to stay at least
For now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away

I'm taking time quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy 
So why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts
Can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you 
I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page

Kindness is a treasure 
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown
So I'd say it for a good measure
To all the ones like you I've known
Ya know I'd like to shave your head
And all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me's a two way street
An all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
No

Affection is a blessing
Can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether
But the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah I know it's hard to face
When all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman
And I'm such a stupid man
But love like time's got its own plans

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
Yeah
If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane

Love's so strange"

No I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought back in this storm
And left so far out from the shore
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore

No, I..
No, I...

Forgive them they teared down my soul
Bless them that they might grow old
And free them so that they may know
That it's never too late

For the many times would seem like a memory
I searched and found the way to choose to the end
I found the ways, why it had to be
Mired in denial and saw all the rain

If we ever find it true
Life we have is made to choose
Free the ball, the chain
We're here together

I'm gonna tell you a story
Stand up for righteousness!
What?
Stand up for justice!
What?
Stand up for truth!
How can a person grow up with all this around them?
You got to call on that something
Where does it come from?
That can make a way out of no way
All this hatred?
What we've got here is..
Fear!
That power that can make a way out of now no way
Failure to communicate
I tell ya I seen the lightning...I've heard the thunder roll!
Everybody's acting like we can do anything and it don't matter what we
Do. Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than
We even know..
Sometimes...
Hatred isn't somethin' you're born with
I feel discouraged
It gets taught
Sometimes I feel discouraged
I felt this fear
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone, no never alone,
No never alone!
Let's get something straight, alright?
Promised never to leave me!
This whole thing was fucked up
Never to leave me alone!
All men betray. All lose heart!
I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe
Black men and white men
Together at the table of brotherhood!
I have a dream
Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty!! WE ARE FREE AT LAST!!



I won't be told anymore

Someday you'll find someone
That'll fall in love with you
But oh the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you'll find someone
That you can call your own
But till then ya better

Now you're clean
And so discreet
I won't say a word
But most of all this song is true
Case you haven't heard

Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big
You know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home

Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy!

Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin' flat on her back
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made

You know nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!

Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with
A flick and a spoon
And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big
You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home

Laughin' at the fuckers as you piss it away

I said it's perfect

An keep the demons down
And drag the skeletons out
I got a blind man followin' me in chains
I said he's fun to watch
When the world has stopped
An I think he's got somethin' to say
""You want to fuck with me?  Don't fuck with me
'Cause I'm what you'll be, so don't fuck with me
If you had better sense
You'd step aside from the bad side of me
Don't fuck wit da bad side o' me
Stay way from the bad side o' me
Don't fuck wit da bad side""

T minus 1:09 and counting...

Ostracized but that's all right
I was thinkin' about somethin' myself

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Call on everybody who's got last rites
Said it's better
If you locked 'em away
Runnin' through the visions
At the speed of light
Won't ya let me be
Mother fucker just let me be
God dammit better let me be
Don't ya know ya better let me aaahh!

And what would you do
If I had to deny your name?
Where would you go if I told you
""I love you""
And then walk away? Oh yeah!
N' who should I turn to
If not for the ones
That you would not save? Alright

I told you when I found you
If there were doubts you
Should be careful and unafraid
Now
They surround you

Is love that you fed by
Perversion and pain

So if my affections
Are misunderstood
And you decide
I'm up

Don't ask me to
Enjoy them

Ask yourself
What I would choose
To prostitute myself
To live with fortune and shame

1051,Guns N' Roses,Sympathy for the Devil,"Please allow me to introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
I've been around for a long, long year 
Stole many a man's soul and faith 

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
Had his moment of doubt and pain 
Made damn sure that Pilate 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game 

I stuck around St. Petersberg 
When I saw it was a time for a change 
I killed the Czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 

I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the Blitzkrieg raged 
And the bodies stank 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 
What's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah 

I watched with glee as your kings and queens 
Fought for ten decades 
For the Gods they made 

I shouted out 
""Who killed the Kennedy?"" 
When after all 
It was you and me 

So let me please introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
And I laid traps for troubadours 
Who get killed before they reached Bombay 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is just the nature of my game 

Just as every cop is a criminal 
And all the sinners saints 
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer 
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 

So if you meet me 
Have some courtesy 
Have some sympathy, and some taste 
Use all your well-learned politesse?
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh baby 

Oh yeah
Tell me baby, what's my name 
Oh tell me honey, can you guess my name?
Oh oh oh oh
Tell me honey, what's my name 
Oh, just the sweetest, tell me what's my name?
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

1052,Guns N' Roses,The Garden,"You know you're all alone
Your friends they aren't at home
Everybody's gone to the garden
As you look into the trees
You can look but you don't see
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care
What's it with you man, and this garden

Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia
If you're lost no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without

You can find it all inside
No need to wrestle with your pride
No you ain't losin' your mind
You're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself
Or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside
For the garden

I wasn't really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering 'round four days
With a smile upon my face
I never want to leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia

1053,Guns N' Roses,There Was a Time,"Broken glass and cigarettes,
Writing on the wall,
It was a bargain for the summer,
And I thought I had it all.
I was the one who gave you everything,
The one who took the fall,
You were the one who would do anything,
The one who can't recall
Where she was while she was sleeping,
In another woman's bed,
Or the doctors or the lawyers,
Or a stranger that she met.
If there's nothing I can gain from this,
Or anything at all,
It'd be the knowledge that ya gave me,
When I thought I had it all.

It was a long time with you,
It was a long time with me,
It'd be a long for anyone,
But looks like it's meant to be.

Social class and registers,
Cocaine in the hall,
All the way from California,
On the way beyond that stall.
To those non-negotiations
To simulate a call,
All the bad of learning evils and your ways around the laws that keep you

Up and sitting pretty,
On a pedestal of men
And now you're sleeping like an angel,
Near the man who reaped it in.

If there's something I can make of this,
Or anything at all,
It'd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all.

It was a wrong time for you,
It was a wrong time for me,
It was the wrong time for everyone
But looks like I'm about to see for myself.

If I could go back in time to the place in my soul,there all alone
Lonely tear drops,
Ooh,are calling you.
But I don't wanna know it now,
'cause knowing you, it won't change a damn thing.
But there was a time.

Yeah, there was a time,
Didn't wanna know it all,
Didn't wanna know it all and
I don't wanna know it now

Oh,

Yeah, there was a time,
Didn't wanna know it all,
Didn't wanna know it all and
I don't wanna know it now,

Oh,
I would do anything for you,
There was a time,
I would do anything for you,
Oh,I would do anything for you,
There was a time.

There was a time,
Oh, I would do anything for you,
Oh, I would do anything for you

1055,Guns N' Roses,This I Love,"And now I don't know why
She wouldn't say goodbye
But then it seems that I
Had seen it in her eyes

And it might not be wise
I'd still have to try
With all the love I have inside
I can't deny

I just can't let it die
'Cause her heart's just like mine
She holds her pain inside

So if you ask me why
She wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside

There is a special light
Still shining bright
And even on the darkest night
She can't deny

So if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else
Could ever make me feel
I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I've searched the universe
And found myself
Within' her eyes

No matter how I try
They say it's all a lie
So what's the use of my
Confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die
In my heart

So if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else
Could ever make me feel
I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I've searched the universe
And found myself
Within' her eyes

So if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else

I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I've searched the universe
And found myself
Within' her eyes

And now I don't know why
She wouldn't say goodbye
It just might be that I
Had seen it in her eyes
And now it seems that I
Gave up my ghost of pride
I'll never say goodbye"

She's buried right in my back yard

I used to love her, but I had to kill her

Suddenly this time I found

I'm her boy and her toy's in my pants

Ronettes are on the radio
And we always sing along
She's the first bird on me list
She makes me have one off the wrist
Yeah, yeah, ye, ye, yeah

I whisper ""Doll do leave it out""

1070,Hanoi Rocks,Cafe Avenue,"I was feeling hungry
I didn't have no money, no
But I was like you'd say ""off the hook""
And sometimes it hit me quite hard
Started searching
For what I don't know
I suppose I started searching
Searching for money and fame
Yes I wild, wild, wild, wild
Through the night sometimes
Blind, blind, blind until it was light
But it was my life
I got prostituted
I just had to get some money, why know
But let me tell you
The more I got the faster it went
Sometimes there in the danger
Of not getting paid
(But) Sometimes I was out all night
Offering the service I gave
Yes I was, yes I was wild, wild, wild, wild
Through the night sometimes
Blind, blind, blind until it was light
Cafe Avenue. I'm comin' back to you once more
To see the same old fools and freaks
Sitting at the same old tables (yeah)
Cafe Avenue, I'm comin' back to you once more
You still remember how bad (bad)
Things were once before
It makes no difference how you are
It makes no difference how you look
In the Cafe Avenue
But now I've found a shelter
And things have turned out much better, yeah
Oh let me tell you
Nowadays
It's so easy to look back"
1071,Hanoi Rocks,Cheyenne,"Part I
I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to see you cry, I don't want to hurt you once more 
I don't want to leave now, I don't want no sight for sore eyes 
Gone sore of all the tears that we cryed

Part II
Hey, come here with the guitar! Okay?

Recall the times we met - so wild and free 
We had our ups and we had our downs
But the sweet sweet rock'n'roll always played on the radio
We grew up and we learned the rules 
You gotta fight to win otherwise you'll lose
Oh Cheyenne, you imprisoned me in liberty 
Never ever showed me no sympathy

Remember that night, how you made me cry, 
I almost lost my mind 
When it appeared that the winner was you and the loser was me 
That night, that endless lonely nite...
I just can't think of you, with another man 
Oh Cheyenne, you must understand

So stay right where you are, I'll pick you up anyway, any day around I'll be with you
So you don't have to worry, you don't have to worry, Baby, don't you worry no more

You told me that I'm to sensitive but I didn't ask for sympathy,
All I wanted was to love you softly
With the sweet, sweet rock'n'roll played on the radio
I tried hard to fight my feelings down 
I tried to hide 'em inside, tried to push your love away
But you must have seen the fire burn in my eyes - and it's still burning!

It's hard to believe we lived it through, I can't believe we can't relive it 
But if you see me walking down the street
Just raise you window to the sweet sweet sound of rock'n'roll
Sweet, Sweet sound of rock'n'roll"
1072,Hanoi Rocks,Cutting Corners,"London is grey 
But it's great in it's way, If you're just barrelling through
You find some first class boiler 
And she boils your cares away
Now life is a gas, but the laughs never last, 
So you add a handful of blues
And that's a first class ticket if you wanna get away

'Cause if you hang around the greys and browns, They'll just bring you down
Well it's a useless rap 
You got to cut the crap
Go directly to the things that matter to you

[Chorus]
Have to cut corners or fade away, Have to cut corners or fade away, Have to cut corners or fade away,You know you Have to cut corners or fade away

Going through channels in ties and grey flannels, Just slows everything down, 
And when I want a thing, I want it right away
Going straight for the heart, 
Tears your wardrobe Apart, 
But it wears the other guy down
I may look a mess but I'm dressed to get my way

'Cos if you hanging around the greys and browns, 
Just bring you down
Well it's a useless rap 
You got to cut the crap
Go directly to the things that matter to you

[Chorus: x2]

""London town is pourin' in the rain
And there's nothin' you can do to ease the pain
So you take a ferry over to France
You cant understand a bloody word they say
So you think sod it I'll ignore these bleedin' foreigners
Then some jobsworth says
""I'm teribly sorry sir but you cannot do that unless you go through proper channels""
And I say
Leave it out mate gimme the keys and I'll drive it home meself""

It's not so long to go, 
Though my face don't show
My temperature it's gettin' too low, 

I've seen it all in a dream, 
I know just how it's gonna feel
Like not to be alive anymore 

I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway, 
Tell me will you remember me that day
When you've found a new one, 
Who's better than I ever was

I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway, 
Please give all my things away
They'll make great X-mas presents for you, 
And for all my friends

It hurts so inside, to see you with another, 
From the edge of a cloud
Whatever happened to the promises that you gave, 
Before the angels took me away, 

So here I'm all dressed in white
While you're drinking up my best red wine, 
And you don't realize that 
I'm with you all the time

It's getting so lonely without you, 
And I'm sure I am jealous too, 
To see another man in my bed
Be sure I can't get no rest, 
Before you're up there with me, 

Come up, come up, come up, come up
I've been dead since X-mas now anyway, 
So leave the flowers on my grave, 
There's sure a way you could join me any day around now honey

You'll be dead by X-mas now anyway, 
You'll Lay beside me in our family grave, 
We'll be making love eternally, 
In a spiritual way

We'll be dead by X-mas now anyway 
We'll sell everything away

Dead by X-mas, dead and gone, 
X-mas is forever we got a life to live, 
A life after death"
1074,Hanoi Rocks,Dear Miss Lonely Hearts,"Dear miss lonely hearts 
I had to write this letter
To tell you how I came to meet her
She was sweet but I dated her sister
That's how I made my mistake 
And I can't forget her 
I felt depressed
‘Til a friend of mine suggested
That I write to this address
So unless you can find a cure 
For my loneliness
It will persist
It will persist

Lonely boy
Looking for another
Lonely girl
To love one another
Lonely hearts
Turn to each other
Lonely souls

Dear lonely boy
I doubt if my reply will bring much joy
It seems from your letter that you lied
Or strongly implied
That you were satisfied
To take her sister by your side

I became distressed
At your total lack of tactfulness 
So at best all I can suggest 
Is that you resist and you put an end
To such thoughts of silliness

Lonely boy

Dear miss lonely hearts
I've got problems
You're the only one I know that can solve them
I love a girl but I'm dating her sister
If I persist in my pursuit I will kiss her
Dear lonely girl
I doubt if this reply will bring much joy
But you must not trust this boy
You must not lust this boy
Resist and do not kiss this boy

1076,Hanoi Rocks,Designs on You,"Goodbye
So now you're leaving
I hope you're feeling
Real good about it
And will not doubt it
When you're without it
And the pain hits back

So it's no more
No more new music
No more tapes I'll make
To help share this lonely heartache
If that's you want
It's only you I want
'Cause it's only human
If your mind should change

You find out about your friends
When you're out on the leap
It gets hard to socialize when of you is all they speak
Can't find no place to hide
When I'm trying to be discreet
With my designs on you

So wrong... But
It just feels so right
When we hold tight
Everything is alright
And this with all my might
I try believing
If that's deceiving
Then I'd rather lie

You could go surfing on the tears that I have cried
No matter how I try I can't say the last goodbye
Can't stop my mind and my heart can't deny
To hide my designs on you

No harm
I meant for no one
And I don't owe one
To myself or no one
I'm on my own now
You might be alone now
Well, I'm still here with

Bank robbery is your life, We gave you a knife
We gave you a Smith and Wesson, we Gave you ourselves to trust on
Women get out of our way, 'Cause if you stay you gotta pray for your lives
We came today to check out the situation 
But we'll be back soon in full attack 

Tonight we'll drink till dawn, As we sing our outlaw songs 
Ten thousand heartaches, baby, Ten thousand heartaches now
Ten thousand heartaches, baby, could never break this cowboy heart of mine
We'll kill all the men and rape all the women, Sometimes we'll even shoot down the children, 
Outlaws don't feel no pity and outlaws is what we are
We both come floating down the street, We shoot down anyone we see
Outlaws don't feel no pity, Because of what we are
We sing desperado's

Ten thousand heartaches, baby, Ten thousand heartaches now
Ten thousand heartaches, baby, could never break this cowboy heart of mine
We are the desperado's, 
We brought the death to El Dorado 
We are the desperado's, We're like tornadoes

This town won't ever rise up again, 
And you'll never see us again
And the woman who tried to break my heart, 
Now her head and body are apart
The tales we tell for generations to come about the fires,
And somewhere in the night

You can still hear the melody, 
But its the memory that's scaring you
Ten thousand heartaches, baby
Ten thousand heartaches now
Ten thousand heartaches, baby
Don't look back and worldwide
We brought death to El Dorado"

1079,Hanoi Rocks,Don't Follow Me,"Well, she used to be an ordinary cowgirl
She could handle her daddy's gun when she was young
And I never believed she'd turn out to be an outlaw
Now she is the rebel on the run
Now she's a stranger always in danger
A black angel on the run
But I'm gonna get her I won't let her disappear
Out of my life like she's always done before

Got a shotgun by her side gunpowder in the fires and
Boy, as she rides!
She just eliminates troubles times with her knives
She's a suffragette and she'll always be a refugee
Seems like she's always been the black sheep of her family

Now she's a stranger always in danger, a black angel on the run
But I'll never get her will I ever learn
She'll repeat the line I've heard so many times before

She says: Don't follow me, I'm lost too
Don't follow me, I'm lost too
Don't follow me, I'm lost too
Baby, I'm lost just like you

I recall she got lost already at the age of seventeen
Her daddy told she was always in the wrong company
She was my teenage love, the queen of the big, big rodeo
And I remember what she was always tellin' to me
Yeah, yeah, and I remember what she was always tellin' to me"

nowhere to sleep tonight

Don't you ever leave me now
Don't you ever leave me baby
If you leave me you will kill me now

When all I really wanted to do was curl up in a corner and cry
Nothing had any meaning

Then you came along like my own ray of sunshine
Made me feel warm, safe and alive again"

Non stop rock 'n' bop and she'll never ever die

In my family tree the fruit is bitter, bold and bad
Got real deep roots, these gypsy boots of mine

Struttin' the fine line, steel-toes sharp just like my mind
My reputation precedes me, I always get what's mine in time
You can't spike me with the evil seed of doubt
You can't tell me what my life could be about
'Less you've walked in these gypsy boots of mine

These gypsy boots, they don't wear down
It's in my blood, I roam around and around

I'm the original rock'n'roll cliche
Gypsy pirate cowboy
You wouldn't last a minute in my boots
'Cause baby, I'm the real McCoy
Can't decide if it's a blessing or a curse

And it kicks so strong, the kick goes on
Over and over till you can't belong
It's an endless song
One, two, three, it goes on

1117,Hanoi Rocks,The Boulevard of Broken Dreams,"All these broken dreams 
Have made me see 
That I'm strung out, somebody rescue me

Do I have to tell you that I care 
Do I have to tell you that I need you to be there 

Cause in the middle of the night 
When I'm much too weak to fight 
You know you're such a welcome sight 
In the middle of the night 
Yeah 

On the boulevard of broken dreams 
Yeah I talk so bad and I act so mean 
On the boulevard of broken dreams 
I gotta get back on my feet 

And was it only yesterday 
You came my way 
Or was it just a while ago 

And do I have to tell you you're my lover 
Do I have to tell you I'm your slave 
And so we have to dance until you're dancing 
On my grave

And my lips are turning white 
And my jaw is getting tight 
And the sun is burning bright 
In the middle of the night 
Yeah 

On the boulevard of broken dreams 
She'll eat your heart and she'll eat your face 
On the boulevard of broken dreams 
And I gotta get back on my feet 

Do I have to tell you that I need you 
Do I have to show you that I care 
Do I have to lie and steal to have you 
Do I have to sell myself somewhere 
Then we can dance all night together 
You'll be my queen I'll be your slave 
And we can stay awake forever 
Until we're dancing on my grave 

On the boulevard of broken dreams

I'm on a one-way street,
I can't retreat,
'Cause my mind and I play hide and seek

They want to make a problem out of me,

I'm not here today, I'm miles away

When you're face to face with history

Yeah its been a long trip, it made me flip
Now I'm crawling on your bedroom floor
Now I'm climbing up your bathroom wall
And I search, I search, in this shit, and i search,
For the eternal party,
Is it in my head, or is it in my bed?
Baby, please baby, I said baby, is it here, or is it there?

Well i just got back from the outer space,
They call me the Flashing Psychedelic Kid

And its  so so sad to see yourself disappear,
I disappear, when i disappear well its too bad
Well, here i go again! And I sing"

There ain't no better way, of killing time, 
Than loving you, cos your my girl

It's reached top speed, and I'm getting inside of you
This is hot stuff Mamma, taste it, It sure tastes good
Yes it does

It's maybe cold outside, but in you the fire is burning
And when you bite me woman, love is hurting

First a little bit too fast, and then a little bit much too slow
Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony I heard today
First a little bit too fast and then a little bit much too slow

I wake up in the morning and I feel, 
The pain in my head
If it's rest I need I'd rather be dead, 
No destination in this life I live
No expectations I just drift and drift, 
And drift
 
Life is like Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony on the radio
First a little bit too fast, and then a little bit much too slow
Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony I heard today
First a little bit too fast and then a little bit much too slow

Hurricanes running through my veins, I know that You're lost and alone

Welcome to the ocean, Welcome to the sea, Welcome to the jungle, Deep inside of me

Sink or swim, you dive right in and you, Know this ain't no place to mess around in
In my swamp underground the quicksand slowly Sucks you down

Well Welcome Chum, Now sit down and shut up
I lay you wide open, For all the world to see"

Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

You became a legend in my life 
When I saw you in a picture topless, you were topless, mama 
Oh yes, your music means a lot to me 
But your face and your body, they drive me crazy 
The only love that exists to me is sex,
And thats what I'd like to share with you 

My imagination always runs away with you 
When I'm with any of my girlfriends i imagine I'm with you
And the morning after when you had left yeah 
The only thing between us two... would be the memory

Oh, please don't remind me
Forget me, you kiss me, you touch me again

I can't forget, can't forget, can't forget you

So every night I cry till it slides

This jealousy is burning, in things I see
It's killing me, so it's killing me
Now that I have to face what I've lost
It's time to pay the price for my lies

You touched me, you asked me
If I never, how I met you,I left you
Oh, please don't remind me
Forget me, you kiss me, you touch me again

Keep my feet on the ground

Then it's trouble you've found
Don't take no schooling to educate me
I'm all the man that I need to be

I am a pound of broken glass yea
I am a motherfucker
Just call me a Billy Badass

I'm all over you like stink on shit
When you put me in a category I don't fit
I set the stand on fire Woodstock '94
It either rocks or it don't and I'm rock to the core
Remember Headbangers ball when MTV was mean
That was back when Carson Daly was still shittin' green
You want to see the Real World, then step on our bus
Cause the Real World is comin' to jam with us

[Chorus]

Well I am a World Record holder,
Got my name in the book
Hundred shows in fifty days
Was all that it took to set the record straight
The way it should be
You say fuck you, I say fuck with me

1139,Jackyl,Can't Beat It With a Stick,"Riding down the road in a nickel black cadillac
Reckon tomorrow I don't want my money back
If I roll then I roll 
Yeah I roll down the road 
I rolled this far
Don't need no high sale
No no no!

[Chorus]
Can't beat it with a stick
Bulletproof, three feet thick
When you got it down keep beating it
Can't beat it
Can't beat it
And if you can then you beat it like this

I had a dream
Woke up in a cold cold sweat
It was one of those dreams though
That you know you'll never forget
Well there was one, no two, no three, no four 
Women in the kitchen whipping me up some food
Four women dressed to the hilt
Dressed like prostitutes

[Chorus:Repeat x3]"
1140,Jackyl,Chinatown,"Big Orange rolled into Boston headed straight for Chinatown
To find the native restless and see what's going down
We hit the streets a walking, checked out a rated X
It was all about a woman and a donkey named Rex

[Chorus]
Get me out of Chinatown
Get me out of Chinatown
I don't like what's going down
So get me out of Chinatown

See the big man dressed in ladies clothes, he looks really rude
I guess he forgot to look at himself when he was in the nude
Jeff and Jimmy had to laugh when the he/she lost his hair
Rolled up in the Cadillac's window that left him standing there

[Chorus]

I seen bigger towns than this
And this is one town I won't miss
Just let me go, I won't leave a thing
Just my ass to kiss"

Gimme back my bullets
Put 'em back where they belong
Ain't foolin' around 'cause I done had my fun

Use the power that's in my hands
To make my wishes your ever command

I put a curse on you, on you
I put a curse on you

I was born of bad blood
A rare mixed breed
With the eye of the devil
And the demon seed

And it's reachin' up around your back
And it's pullin' you down

The beautiful sound of silence

A load of dynamite powder

Cut it up, 'cause I can't feel it
Cut it out, before I snap
Cut the crap

Cut it on, so I can hear it
Cut it up, 'cause I can't feel it
Cut in out, before I snap
Cut it on, so I can hear it
Cut it up, 'cause I can't feel it
Cut it out, before I snap

Occurred to me the sun could go away

[Chorus]
I can't believe it, my world is tall and faster
I can't conceive it, the calm before disaster
Raining down on me
And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness

Never to return, I know it's true
And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness
But before I go I'll slip my disease into you
I feel the pain of having to sit next to yourself
Yesterdays tomorrow really makes me mad

[Chorus]

Never to return, I know it's true
And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness
But before I go I'll slip my disease into you
Feeling down, going out of control
I can feel the life draining from my very soul
You got your hands around my neck
You're pulling me down
And you're pulling me down
Is this for real or is it a dream
Hello moviegoers, is there no shame?

[Chorus]

Never to return, I know it's true
And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness
But before I go I'll slip my disease into you
Into you
Into you
Into you
Into you"
1145,Jackyl,Dirty Little Mind,"Well I licked her clean from head to toe
I took her down for the count
She was ready for more

The way she walks
The way she grooves
I have to strap her down to keep up with her moves
And you know she's got a dirty little mind

[Chorus]
She's got a dirty

1146,Jackyl,Dixieland,"Down South where the air is wet
The red day rules and you can bet
It makes me proud, I'll never forget
My Dixieland

Fulton County Georgia that's where I was born
With a fire in my tail and a devil's horn
Daddy never listened to my mother's scorn
He loved to play it loud
And he played it loud

[Chorus]
Look away Dixieland
Cause we're a rock and roll rebel Dixie band
Look away Dixieland

Lost a lot of time ten years to the day
Lost a lot of time trying to find my way
If I make it back home I'll be okay
And here's to that day

Ice tea washes and corn bread dream
It's what keeps me going or so it would seem

I keep it up, never let up steam
I sing it loud and proud
Loud and proud

[Chorus]

And when the day comes around that my music's gone
Don't leave me here and don't leave me alone
Just take me back home to the boys in the band
We'll start it back up in Dixieland"
1147,Jackyl,Down This Road Before,"Well I've been down this road so many times before
You know it never seems to pay
Every town just another town
Just as every night turns into day
And the miles and miles they take their toll
And add up to the lines on my face
I'd sell my sole right here and now if I could only only win this race

[Chorus]
I've been down this road before
I think I can take a little more
Just load it in and set it up
And I'll throw down one more time

I've been down this road
So many times before but as for now I feel no pain
I cross the fine between pleasure
I tipped the genius to insane

[Chorus]"

All the things I know that are true
And when the light in the morning
Comes shining through

I see, I see

I see the sun shining 
Down on me
I feel the heat of love's flame
Down on me
I love the thought of you comin'
Down on me
And I'm so wet from love raining 
Down on me

Down on me, down on me

All the things you mean to me
All the things I want us to be
And when the man in the moon
Looks straight at you

I see, oh I see

And you're a new kinda way
That's getting stranger every day
Get on the good foo and keep it on top
One thing for certain, it ain't ever gonna stop

1149,Jackyl,Dumb Ass Country Boy,"I'm just a dumb ass country boy
I think people wanna rock but what do I know
I remember the days when men were men
If it was up to me I'd bring 'em back again
And I'd kick your candy asses up around your jaded ears

I'm just a dumb ass country boy
I think people wanna rock but what do I know
I got friends with names like Slim and Coy
Just a dumb ass country boy
I'm just a dumb ass country boy

I punch the clock for 40 'cause it's all I know
Remember the days of jammin' drugs and love
And it was cool to say yes to all the above
And I still can't find nothing wrong
With saying yes to smoking mother nature

I'm just a dumb ass country boy
I think people wanna rock but what do I know
Got friends with names like Slim and Coy

Now people listen to me, I'm your social conscience
I been gone for a while you've had to make it on your own
Now people listen to me, you got no social conscience
You gotta get up, get up and get over it

That's right, I just wanna change the world
Change the world's diapers that is
All those tender ass sons o' bitches
Who are all these goobers who say
What's cool and what's not cool
What's hip and not hip?

Yeah, I might be a one hit wonder
I might not be
But then again it might only take me one hit
To knock your teeth down your God damn throat

That's right, the girls only want crab my ass
So Peggy ass pal
It's time for me to drive this Impala
You need to be programmed, I'll program your ass
Listen to me motherfucker, listen to me

I'm just a dumb ass country boy
I think people wanna rock but what do I know
Got friends with names like Slim and Coy
I'm just a dumb ass country boy

I think people wanna rock but what do I know
Got friends with names like Slim and Coy
It's the simple things that I enjoy
With my friends that are named Slim and Coy

Hey, what do I know?
What do you know?
What does anybody fuckin' know?

1151,Jackyl,God Strike Me Dead,"As I sit here grinning like a mule eating briars,
It occurs to me that I lost something that was part of me
And it fills this empty house with a feeling
A feeling of even greater emptiness

[Chorus]
God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul comes together again
My lifeline's stretched and now it's thin
Please God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again

And it's getting purt' near the point
Of feeling pretty numb as I start to think
Of all the things that I wish
That I could change and then some
And the numbness turns into pain
And underneath there shows a stain
I try my best to try and hide the things
That eat me up inside

[Chorus]
God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again
My lifeline's stretched and now it's thin
Please God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again

And I know more every day
Just exactly how it came to be this way
One more chance I'd steal it
One chance to do it again, again

God strike me dead, God strike me dead
God strike me dead"

Well Heaven don't want me and Hell's afraid I'll take over
Yea, I've been known to throw a damper on a party or two
And I chewed up and swallowed my own four-leaf clover
Now Heaven don't want me and Hell's afraid I'll take over

The Twelfth of never came
And I stood the one to blame
Redheaded stepchild in the face of all that's good
And I came to understand my life's in my hands
Can't ever bear to think of givin' up control again
I'm takin' over

Far from the beaten path left of the aftermath
It was never my intention to try and tow the line
Anything, all or nothin'
Justify the means at end
Seize the moment, Seize the day
You never cease to stand in my way
Now I'm takin' over

Can't even bear giving up control again

I yearn to touch you late at night
I can start the fire, but I can't control the flame
The love in your hand not other hand could do the same

I could build a building straight up to the sky
But you can take me higher, here's the reason why

I could never touch you like you do
I could never touch you
No matter how much I really wanted to
I could never touch you
Like you do
I could never touch you
I could never touch you like you do

The overflow of love keeps flowing
More than any man could ever want
I can swim forever in your garden lake
The magic in your hand, it takes your magic for the dam to break

And I would crawl across burning desert sand
Just to have the voodoo that's in your hand

I can feel your heart beat next to mine
Girl you show me all I need to see
You take me where I want to be

And I give everything I got
And they take take take
Everything I'm giving

My legs both ache
In this life
There is no cake
This life I'm livin'

I just know I feel this way
I stand alone today

Well you look at me
Shake your head
Don't like my hair
You're so misled, you do!

But the curse is more than on my head
Sometimes I think I'm better off dead
It's worse than voodoo

And I'm reaching out for help
But it's no no no no no 
Until you give in

My back is tired
My legs both ache
In this life
There is no cake
This life I'm livin'

Everything I'm givin'
It's a rough rough life

I can't stop, no I ain't a quitter
I'm on fire, ah baby I'm a home run hitter
You can turn your back on me now

Home where the clay is red like my neck down in Dixie

My pockets are lined they are full of pay day
With every move I make you know the South is  risin'
Say you want it heavy now
Hell yea!  Hell yea!

First taste of freedom gets you high
Then you crave more freedom
I got more attitude than your money can buy

Fuck all the rules I never call before I dig
When I come around my friends say ""Hey Big""

I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line"

But the fact still remains
You're finger licking good

Wanted so much

Still I feel that there's everything to reclaim

Cause I'm losin' ground and I'm goin' down fast
If you can save my soul, lend me your hand
Lend me your hand

She loves it when she bleeds
Cause it reminds her that she's not the only one
It makes it easy to forget what she has done
All the while the pain is growing inside
She's crying out somebody lend me a hand

Is anybody out there

Can you hear me
Can you hear me now

Can you hear me now
Can you lend me your hand

1164,Jackyl,Let's Don't Go There,"There's a place inside my soul
There's a place that's not quite whole
And it seems it's hear to stay
It grows a little everyday
And it's getting bigger
It's getting bigger
It's getting bigger

(Chorus)
But let's don't go there
Let's don't go, you can't compete
Let's don't go, you lose your bet
Let's don't go, it makes you wet
And I know nobody wants to know from rain

There's a place inside my head
There's a place I go instead
And I feel the need to be
There anyway, the feeling
Grows everyday and it's getting bigger
It's getting bigger
It's getting bigger

1170,Jackyl,Mister Can You Spare a Dime,"All right people, step right up
Don't be afraid to throw that change
Me and my buddy gonna play you a tune
Goes something like this

I got a friend that lives in the city, in New York City
Puts a brown bag under his arm
Walks down the street till he gets into a big box
Crawls inside and has a sea,t in a cardboard box
In the city, New York City stop

Two, three, four
He always finds the cheap wine
Its liquid heat but it makes a meal
Finally takes a drink and he shakes his head
No, life's not pretty in the city, New York City

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, 'Hey mister, can you spare a dime?'

Well, I'm standing on the edge of insanity
Looking over the edge
Things look greener on the other side
Sit around and worry about things
Wonder why, till I literally breakdown and cry

And it seems as though I've reached out
And slapped the world on the balls
Grabbed it by the throat
Slammed it up against the wall

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, 'Hey mister, can you spare a dime?'

Take it on back to Georgia boys, yeah
Mr Worley

So if you're looking down on me
Don't like what you see
I've been around a time or two
And I'll make a fool of you

And so what if I reached out
And slapped the world on the balls
Grab me by the throat
And slam me up against the wall

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, hey mister, hey mister

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, 'Hey mister, hHey mister, hey mister, can you spare a dime'
Give it up

1171,Jackyl,Mr. Evil,"Now you went and spilt your guts on the floor
About the things you think that I ignore
Can't you see I tend to your needs
That are important
You say just hold me, but that just ain't enough
I see through it when you call your own bluff
Can't you see I'm just a man that's doin' the best I can
To make you glad that you're a woman

[Chorus]
You call me the bad guy yet
You love all the things that I do to you
Yea I'm Mr. Evil
Give the Devil his due

No deeds too small to go unnoticed
Good or bad, you must me punished
You've been a bad girl
I don't think you ever intend to change
Why should you change
And I can see you're certainly a woman

1172,Jackyl,My Life,"Hey Mister Radio can I slide into your daytime
I promise we'll make some classic rock history
I once played a party where some college dudes lived
I guess that means my music can be called alternative

I did not choose the road I had to take
It's the American way I had to make it my own break

[Chorus]
This is my life and I'm down to my soul
This is my life, this is my rock and roll
This is my life and I've taken control of me

You had it locked tight but I slipped through the crack
You dug the hole now it's broken your back
Now take a good look at me, look at my face
I am the one that has taken your place

I do not fear the things I feared before
You had control but I wanted it more than you

[Chorus]

It's all about me

Hey Mister Radio can I slide into your daytime
I promise we'll make some great ratings history
I just need a break from your relentless routine
You gotta make your own break, don't you know what I mean

I will not follow your format no more
This is the future, let's see what's in store for me

1173,Jackyl,Nobody's Fault,"Lord I must be dreaming, what else could this be 
Everybody's screamin', runnin' for the sea 
Holy lands are sinkin', birds take to the sky 
The prophets all are stinkin' drunk, I know the reason why
Eyes are full of desire, mind is so ill at ease 
Everything is on fire, shit piled up to the knees 


Out of rhyme or reason, everyone's to blame
Children of the season don't be lame 
Sorry, you're so sorry, don't be sorry 
Man has known and now he's blown it upside down 
And hell's the only sound 
We did an awful job and now they say it's nobody's fault 


Old Saint Andres seven years ago 
Shove it up their richters, red lights stop and go 
Noblemen of courage listen with their ears 
Spoke but how discouragin' when no one really hears 
One of these days you'll be sorry, too many houses on the stilt 
Three million years or just a story, four on the floor up to the hilt 


Out of rhyme or reason, everyone's to blame 
Children of the season don't be lame 
Sorry, you're so sorry, don't be sorry 
Man has known and now he's blown it upside down 
And hell's the only sound 
We did an awful job and now we're just a little too late 


Eyes are full of desire, mind is so ill at ease 
Everything is on fire, shit piled up to the knees


California showtime, 5 o'clocks the news 
Said everybody's concubine was prone to take a snooze 


Sorry, you're so sorry, don't be sorry 
Man has known and now he's blown it upside down 
And hell's the only sound 
We did an awful job and now we're just a little too late"
1174,Jackyl,Open Up,"I'm sitting stoned all alone in a room full of friends
'Cause it lifts the world off me
Black light shining on Jimmy's face
It'll never let him be free
Oh, oh, ashes fall from the spliffs I roll
Oh, oh, burning holes in my crushed velvet soul
Oh, all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Is to open up and let the outside in
Open up and let it begin
Open up and let it come together
Open up and let it in
A Dodge Dart pulls through the drive-through
Of the hell hole I'm standing in
Welcome to the crown of thorns, Chris Kringle
Never been my friend
Oh, oh, wishes fall from my tongue like drool
Oh, oh, the ground floor of life is cruel
Oh, oh, all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Come together
I see it now, I'm gonna get it
I see it, I'm gonna let it, let it, let it, let it begin
Let it begin, let it begin
Open up, open up
Open up and let the outside in
Open up and let in begin
Open up and let it come together
Open up and let it in
Open up and let the outside in
Open up and let it begin
Open up and let it come together
Open up and let it in"
1175,Jackyl,Open for Business,"AJ drives to his general store
And for the millionth time he unlocks the door
His wife's not around, she's been dead for years
When I was a kid they used to sell me beers
Why he even bothers to open the door
The store's completely empty from ceiling to floor

Everyday open for business
Lay your hand cause the dealing's done
Life goes on and on day after day
Just like AJ, got to find you a way
To open for business

The cracks in the wall is like the lines in his face
They run deep in to show that you can never replace
All the years go by and the place that he's found
They say the shit is coming through
He said build it up around
Wonder how he managed to stay
In an old empty building
He makes it ok

Everyday open for business
Lay your hand cause the dealing's done
Life goes on and on day after day
Just like AJ, got to find you a way
To open for business

Everyday open for business
Life goes on and on and on and on

He drives his '38 Ford to the general store
And for the millionth time he unlocks the door
The gas pumps are gone from where they were before
Is this good or bad?
He's gonna do a little more

Everyday open for business
Lay your hand cause the dealing's done
Life goes on and on day after day
Just like AJ, got to find you a way to

After all that I've been through
I've paid more than just my dues

And when I lay down without you it makes it easy to go to sleep

Sparks from Candy
A butterfly in a jar
I smell danger
How can it melt in your mouth,
I don't understand
Unless it melts in your hand

Don't stop until it spills on the floor
A roller coaster car gonna jump off the track
You're it
I love to see your quiver
Black light shine from above
Show me your double dippin' delight
Out of sight
Spank love in a gentle way
I feel you breathe, I feel you breathe, I feel you breathe

No need to fudge
I'm gonna die from it

All hell is breaking loose
Across a blackened sky

Did she burn his dinner bread (why)?
Did she mix his drink to strong?
What did she do so God damn wrong (why)?

Speak of the devil, hey mister devil speak to me
Speak of the devil, hey mister devil speak to me
Speak of the devil, there's a devil inside of me

Out of the frying pan into the fire
Out of me this devil jumps again
As the little one looks on to see his daddy
Growing horns here in this devil's den
Thunder rolls across the sky
Lightning strikes then goodbye (again)

[Chorus]

I never meant to be the bearer of bad news
Out of the mouths of babes comes the truth I lose
Speak of the devil, look what I have done
Look what I have done
Look what I have done
Look what I have done"

Until I see the hypocrite faces
As they congratulate me
I don't hold a grudge
They know not what they do
They just chase the trends
Set by me and you
So I may not have won a thing
But I got peace of mind
And I'll just sing my songs
To the people who want to
Have a good time
Have a gram on me one time

1187,Jackyl,The Lumberjack,"I was born in the backwoods
Of a two-bit nowhere town
Fathered up some rock 'n' roll (baby)
So you mothers could boogie down
I ain't whistling dixie
No I'm a rebel with a groove
All around the world they go 'round and 'round
When they dig on my new stainless steel sound

[Chorus]
I'm a lumberjack baby
I'm gonna cut you down to size
I'm a lumberjack baby
And you're the one that gets my prize
And when you hear my motor running
You know I surely be coppin' a rise
So I'm gonna crank it up and cut it down

I'm a lumberjack baby
I'm a lumberjack now baby
I'm a lumberjack baby
I'm a lumberjack baby
But I ain't jacked my lumber baby
Since my chain saw you"

Replace your hand that's on my back
Stab your verdict in its place
I can't fight the feeling
Gotta say what's on my mind
Why have you forsaken me, forsaken me, forsaken me
Don't forget just where you came from
Where you used to be
It all comes around
It all comes around
It all comes around

Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
To wear you thin
Twice as ugly, twice as loud
Twice as cocky, twice as proud
Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
Just watch me grin
Twice as ugly, twice as ugly
I'm back again

I offer no apologies
For things that I have done
I'll fuck and drink and smoke and cuss
Damned to have my fun
You can't fight the feeling
Gotta say what's on your mind
Why have you awakened me, awakened me, awakened me
I know you got it in you
To fuck and drink and smoke and cuss
Don't you hate it
You're just like us
Yeah, you're just like us

Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
To wear you thin
Twice as ugly, twice as loud
Twice as cocky, twice as proud
Here I am, back again

Now the time is as right as it ever was
Got a good buzz all is right you see
I got a good time in my sights

[Chorus]
And she dances on the center stage
Like a fantasy jumps straight off the page
She got electric moves and got them down to a tee
She got a Vegas smile, she gets a rise out of me

Those all American girls got it goin' on
They got it all in place oh yea
And they let it be known
And she ain't wrong

From Detroit City down to Bourbon Street
Dip me hand in the cookie jar oh yea
And I'm hangin' with the world's elite
Look at that boys

[Chorus]

It's so good it will make you fall to your knees and beg for forgiveness
It'll make you crawl across the desert on your hands and knees for a long hot mile
It's time to break it down like a shotgun when you see that Vegas smile

1190,Jackyl,We're an American Band,"On the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze.
Sweet, sweet Connie  doin' her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact.
Up all night with Freddy King
I got to tell you poker's his thing
A booze 'n ladies keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band

Four young chaquitas in Omaha
Was waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective he was out-a-sight
Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, ""Come on, dudes, let's get it on,""
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down

1191,Jackyl,When Will It Rain,"When will it rain, I feel the heat burning through my shoes
Soft shoulders are getting harder adding to my blues
Can't count the days gone by, can't wish away the stain
On the life behind me from which I came

The heat is getting hotter
The day is getting longer
The sun will show no mercy, my nights are spent in vain
I chose this long road and on it I remain
When will it rain

[Chorus]
When will it rain
Can't stand this heat from the road, can't stand the pain
When will it rain
It's burning holes in my shoes, won't you tell me
When will it rain
I think I'm going insane
When will it rain
I'm on the road that will never take me home
When will it rain

When will it rain my mouth is as dry as desert sand
And I've tried to hide in every corner of this land
You can't lose the things attached or that's what they say
Things I loved, attached or not, I've thrown away

The heat is getting hotter
The day is getting longer
The sun will show no mercy, my nights are spent in vain
I chose this long road and on it I remain
When will it rain

[Chorus]

I've walked for miles and miles in a dead man's shoes
You can walk, you can run, but can't hide from the blues
And I've felt the pain of the world falling down on me
All I need is a little cool rain to set me free

[Chorus]

When will it rain, when will it rain, when will it rain"

Everybody's sippin' 
On their pain

But I'll gladly take the blame

Is she runnin' from her past? 
It's only life 
She's so afraid of love 
Is so afraid of hate 
What's she runnin' from now?? 

Do you do you want to scream? 
Do you do you want to face the strange? 
Do you do you believe? 
Are you are you afraid of change? 

It's only life 
She's so afraid of this 
And so afraid to ask 
She hides behind her mask 
Nothing's ever right 
She's so afraid of pain 
So afraid of blame 
It's driving her insane 

So insecure 
There is no cure 

Well, she's so afraid 
She's so afraid of death 
She's so afraid, afraid of life 
The drama in her head 
Getting louder all the time 
Getting louder all the time 

She's so afraid, afraid to lose 
Been so afraid of fame 
Everyday she feels the same 
It's driven her insane
It's driven her
It's driven
It's 

Another broken pretty thing"

Mixes valium with her beliefs

She's walkin' trouble with an innocence 
I'll just sit here thinkin' on my window sill 
She keeps me high Miss Babykills 
She's sugar but she's spicy, licks the 
Venom off her lips 
Dressed like a school girl 
Loves her poisoned fingertips 
I just know I love her, she sent 
From above for me

Or catch a freight train
Or a rocketship into outer space

To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did

Seasons must change
Separate paths, separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain

I knew it all along
I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, that's okay

Down from L.A.
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

That's alright, that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
Thats's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain

1211,Mötley Crüe,Driftaway,"Look inside the mirror 
But I don't know who I see 
Smoke another cigarette 
A smile holds back the tears 
These contradictions 
Seem to be the story of my life 
A simple man with memories 
Of those long lost golden days 
I close my eyes and slowly driftaway 

Mistakes I've made remind me 
Of the roads I shouldn't choose 
Never comes that easy 
When you've nothing left to lose 
I can't see the answers 
Tell me why am I so blind? 
A tired man who'll make the best 
Of another lonely day 
I close my eyes and slowly driftaway 

Never thought I'd make it 
Just from playin' my guitar 
Just a little smile 
Always shelters me from pain 
Everytime I start to slide 
I wish upon a star 
The sun comes out 
And dries up all the rain 

I'm an honest man 
Who refused the shade 
On a hot and lonely day 
I close my eyes and dream my life away 
Now I know that I can stop the rain 
Close my eyes and slowly driftaway

1212,Mötley Crüe,Droppin Like Flies,"A war zone in the streets 
It's anarchy and siege 
We hope it goes away 
Graffiti on the walls in modern Babylon 
Nothing left to save 
Feel the rebel's heed 
Revolution undermines belief 
My eyes have seen this shit before 
We're barely hangin' by the skin of our teeth 

We've all raped it 
The future's wasted 
We can't save it now 
We're droppin' like flies 
Bye bye your droppin' like flies 

Hate is growing fast 
In a haze cloud of crack 
But it helps us fade away 
Some inner city queen french kisses his disease 
With one foot in the grave 
And the junkyard we call home 
Is primed and ready for another war 
My, my, my, the children have no chance 
These eyes have seen this all go down before 

We've all raped it 
The future's wasted 
Can we take it? 
Is nothing sacred? 
We can't save it now 

Woke up late in a fresh dug grave 
With a conscience on my brain 
I'm not here to save your world 
But mine won't stay the same 
We're droppin' like flies 
Bye, bye, your droppin' like flies

1213,Mötley Crüe,Fight for Your Rights,"Can't break the chains 
Can't solve the pain 
Can't rhyme problem with reason 

Not taking sides 
Just asking why 
Does the pain eat the children 

Who wrote the Bible 
Who set the laws 
Are we left to history's flaws 

And if you're out there 
Then let me hear (hey) 
And take a look in the mirror 

Fight fight for your rights 
Fight fight for your rights 

Can't name no names 
Of who's to blame 
For cries out in the sky 

We're all slaves to time 
No color's right 
Throw our hate into the fire 

Martin Luther 
Brought the truth 
The color of our blood's the same 

So break the chains 
And solve the pains 
And we all become one race 

Fight fight for your rights 
Fight fight for your rights 

Oh, people, people 
Is the scar too deep 
You can't hold a man's soul 
By the color of his keys 
A tear of blood runs from my eye 
But somehow I can never 
Make you...cry..."

Lay destroyed beaten beaten down

And dream of better days 
Oh life it's misunderstood yeah 
Life's not always fair or so they say

Daddy won't be home tonight 
And he don't know why 
His mother she sits alone 
Tangled in the web she's sewn 
She lives lie to lie

Strangled, caged, left alone 
Doin' time in a broken home 
Feelin' left to die 
I'm a product of your troubled ways 
You made me what I am today 
Now you're askin' why 

Oh, life it's misunderstood me 
So I close my eyes 
And dream of better days 
Oh, life it's misunderstood me

Searches for some piece of mind 
Livin' just to die 
I'm an angry man I always have 
Had to fight to survive my past 
Sign of these times 

Life, it's misunderstood me 
And I know, know you've been there too 
Time lets a restless soul fade away

All their dreams would come true

Too fast to know 
He wouldn't go slow 
Until his lethal dose

He'll finally come too close

The time has come and 
He's paid his dues 
Suzy finally got the news 
She always knew 
This day would come soon

He was stopped on a dime 
With a switchblade knife 
Some damn punk went and 
Took Frankie's life

She'd have to pull through 

Broken down, with his broken dreams 
With a wink of an eye 
Said Suzy, listen to me

They blame it on the devil's tongue 
Suck me like a parasite, military 3rd reich

Now that I'm much older

You just gotta say ""Hey""

Oooh tear it out

Meters are red
Blow a neurotic fuse

Show a little
A little pain
Unlock a lotta truth

His home was livin' Hell
Mama tried to be so perfect
Now her mind's a padded cell, ya

Grab it and shake
Reach down scrape it

I deal with my problems at my own pace
With your screwed-down, anti-human views
Deal with the pressures by playing the blues
If you want to live life on your own terms
You gotta be willing to crash and burn

Needed a friend
Come back to me

Standing alone in the light
You could see her cry
With a smile and a wink
And a sparkle in her eyes
She calmly sighed, I will be alright
Okay child you've had to take the pain
Of a man in the streets
You gotta let me in

Look around I stop and stare
Got to get a taste
Pretty women everywhere
We ain't got time to waste
Lookin' for a little thang 
To fit into my plans
On the town I'll hurt you down
I'm walkin' like a man

1281,Mr. Big,Ain't Seen Love Like That,"I've been miles from nowhere, crossed and doubled back
Time is a healer and I've done my time, 'cos I ain't seen love like that

I've seen the light of freedom, dim and fade to black
So many faces, but no one compares, no I ain't seen love like that

And I've got people tellin' me to let her go, don't let it turn you around
Tomorrow's coming and you'll never know, the one that you lost may be found

I believe in justice, I wonder where she's at
It feels like a lifetime and it just ain't fair
No I ain't seen love like that

And I've got people tellin' me to let her go, that girl is bringing you down
Tomorrow's coming and you'll never know, the love that you lost may be found

You know that people tell me to let her go, don't let it turn you around
Tomorrow's coming and you'll never know, the love that you lost may be found
 
I've been miles from nowhere, crossed and doubled back
Time is a healer and I've done my time, no I ain't seen love like that

No I ain't seen love like that - so many faces
Ain't seen love like that - and no one compares
I ain't seen love like that
Ain't seen love like that - ain't seen love
Ain't seen love like that - no, no I ain't

Stevie Ray blasting on the radio
As I slam it into higher gear

My baby's by my side, tears in her eyes
Writing a Goodbye letter
Sayin' Johnny and me are runnin' wild and runnin' free
Just like you did Momma

Don't know where we're going'
But when we get there we'll know
We're gonna follow the code of the road

Jump into the fire
Keep our love alive and kickin'
Down the door, it's what we livin' for
Rockin' side by side
Keep your love alive and kickin'

We got everything we own in the trunk and on the roof
And she's got baby sitting money in her pocket
We're drivin' fast, ain't no looking back
We're flyin' through the desert like a rocket

White line windin' up interstate five
The road goes on forever
And it doesn't matter where it's gonna take us
As long as we're together

We're takin' our chances
Gonna do it our way
Pedal to the metal shooting down the highway

Jump into the fire
Keep you love alive and kickin'
Down the door, it's what we're livin' for
Rockin' side by side
Keep you love alive and kickin'

Jump into the fire
Keep you love alive and kickin'
Down the walls, that's when
Freedom calls

Your one liners
I can do without

Easy come, easy go
I can't back down baby

Anything for you
If I only had you by my side
I would do anything for you

You and I were made to move
Just put the diamond into the groove

A million faces
We're hoping to see
Where everybody's standing
Staring back at me

Shout it all together we've got something to say
Gather up anyone that you can find
Forget the masqueraders, leave 'em all behind

1285,Mr. Big,Arrow,"The clock is ticking on the table in my room
Funny how the time just slips away
An ordinary simple man 
Who's lost a little piece of something
Hold my breath and close my eyes
Say a little prayer
Here we go again hello
I didn't see the end and so the story goes
How can I be cool?
I always play the fool
I need a shot of love
Look an arrow through the heart
My mind is open to the page of yesterday
Isn't it a crime how love can go
I always knew there would come a day
When silence played the king of pain
So I close my eyes and hold my breath
And contemplate a change
Here we go again hello
I didn't see the end and so the story goes
How can I be cool?
I always play the fool
I need a shot of love
Like an arrow through the heart
I have my faith in life
I know the truth inside
This time I swear it's gonna be better

I want it all, and more than you know

My heart is achin' from a shot in the dark
I got a feeling; what this is all about?
I think it's time for the big love
I'm gettin' ready for the big love

Everytime I think about you 
I get a lump in my throat
From the big beat in my heart
I am helpless, hungry for attention
I know you could see me fall apart

Can't seen to shake trouble
Follows me wherever I go

My mama told me I was always in a hurry
You'd better slow down or you'll lose control
I've loved and lost for the moment
It never lasted long enough
You come to me when something gets broken
But I won't let it get me down

Blame it on my youth
Put it to the circumstances
Blame it on my youth
I can't be judged for my actions
I'm an accident waiting to happen
Blame it on my youth

Someday I might stop being a child
But for now it looks as though
I'm having too much fun
You're as young as you feel
From the inside
Inside and out you're always on the run

Angels with dirty faces
A little lost but not innocent
Time steals people and places
But I won't let it get me down

Blame it on my youth
Put it to the circumstances
Blame it on my youth
I can't be judged for my actions
I'm an accident waiting to happen
Blame it on my youth

To clear the fog inside your mind
Fill it up with dreams
But all that you can seem to find

Movin' to Atlantis
Could've made it if you tried

[Chorus]
How does it feel when the hurt is on
And the blame is worn on you
How does it feel when your pride is torn,
Your best years are gone and used
How does it feel

I was holdin' on, now I'm leavin'
And there ain't no chance I'm goin' back
Seven years of believing it could change
We keep on holdin' on
You can fight but you're never wrong

How does it feel when the hurt is on
And the blame is worn on you
How does it feel when your pride is torn,
Your best years are gone and used
How does it feel

I don't know where I belong
We still fight but you're never wrong oh
We've been dying for too long,
How does it feel

[Chorus]

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel"
1305,Mr. Big,I Don't Want to Be Happy,"I married my high school drama queen
She pulled the curtains over me
Then it was I now pronounce you a one act fool
I've been sitting here wishing for my pot of gold
And my ship to come on in
But the mother load is just another load of shit that I've been sinking in
Say goodbye to greener pastures, living happy ever after
I don't wanna be happy
So what if I'm blue
I'm not looking for a change I'm keeping my old shoes
I don't wanna be happy
That's why I'm with you
Now it's Oprah and Sally and how the world turns
And the big time money that I'll never earn
When only the sun goes down the party's over
If misery loves company
Then, baby you and I were meant to be
Tomorrow's turning out to be a beautiful day, yeah
Say goodbye to greener pastures, living happy ever after
I don't wanna be happy
So what if I'm blue
I'm not looking for a change
I'm keeping my old shoes
I don't wanna be happy
That's why I'm with you

We settle for poor connection
Got it down to imperfection"
1306,Mr. Big,If That's What It Takes,"Comfort me
From a world where no one cares
Where the words turn into cages
And memories cut like glass 
I closed my eyes on you
Put the blames on myself
The weight is on my shoulders
Throw my heart in the wishing well
I've got to face and tame my demons
I know it's hard to start over again,
Yeah, I know.
Through trials and tribulations
Salvation's like a long lost friend
I'll take back all of the hurt
For your love I've taken for granted
I'll do anything to change
If that's what it takes
No use in pretending
Ain't no pride in it all
A cure for independence
Is when you're standing in the cold
Have I used have I used my chances
Have my bridges all been burned
Give me a sign of inspiration
To find a stone that's left unturned
I see a distant promise of Eden
Lifting my spirits so high
If I can break out of the circle
Gonna kiss that carousel goodbye
I'll take back all of the hurt
For your love I've taken for granted
I'll do anything to change
If that's what it takes [solo]
I've got to see a promise of Eden
Lifting my spirits so high
If I can break, break out of the circle
Gonna kiss that carousel goodbye
I'll take back all of the hurt
For your love I've taken for granted
I'll do anything to change, baby
If that's what it takes 
Take back all of the hurt
For your love I've taken for granted
I'll do anything to change
If that's what it takes
If that's what it takes"
1307,Mr. Big,Jane Doe,"Can I explain it?

It's not not an easy thing to do

A cryptic fascination

Seems to get me through

A darkened stranger

Who left me full of doubt

She'd tell me that she loved me

Then the lights went out

Jane Doe, what was her name

Where did she go

Jane Doe, she slipped away again

Does anybody know?

Jane Doe

Platonic whisper

That makes me want to shout

Then she always disappears

Like a lady from a Barcly House

Who is this woman

Someone that I invent

I follow all night long

Like a bloodhound on a secret

Jane Doe, what was her name

Where did she go

Jane Doe, she slopped away without

a trace

I still don't know

Jane Doe

There's no fault, no blame

Love can twist the brain

This picture lost its frame

And John has lost his Jane

Jane Doe, what was her name

Where did she go

Jane Doe, slippped away again

Does anybody know?

Jane Doe

There's no fault, no blame

Love can twist the brain

This picture lost its frame

And John has lost his Jane

1308,Mr. Big,Just Take My Heart,"It's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping
I can't imagine living my life after you're gone
Wondering why so many questions have no answers
I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong

Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go

Here we are about to take the final step now
I just can't fool myself, I know there's no turning back
Face to face it's been an endless conversation
But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk

I'd give my everything
If only I could turn you around
But if this is goodbye

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go"
1309,Mr. Big,Little Mistake,"Just a little mistake, oh no
Now I gotta pay, oh no
Cos the rumours have been going round
From a little mistake

I can't look them in the eyes no more
And I'm haunted by the memory
Thinking what for
I don't know, I don't know

I did my best friend wrong
It didn't last too long
Cos the woman who was coming round
Was a little mistake

Better days were coming
Now I'm banished and blamed
Take my chances in another town
Just a little mistake

But the highway only runs so far
God is not about to leave me
No matter how far I might go, I might go

Now a year's gone by
Cos I ain't gonna die
Cos nobody ever comes around
From a little mistake
Yeah just a little mistake

I can't look them in the eyes no more
And I'm haunted by the memory thinking what for
I don't know, I don't know

Just a little mistake
From a little mistake
From a little mistake
A mistake"
1310,Mr. Big,Lost in America,"Silent voices close their minds and hide
Behind their secret gardens
Welcome to the age of rage
And everybody's high on something Run, see Jack run
With all the little piggies in a row
They come, They go
Does anyone five a damn
Who I am or where I'm going
I an your favorite some come undone
Lost in America
Suck your poison, throw your rhymes
And wait for something bad to happen
Stand behind your middle finger
Cool to kill is still in fashion
Run, see Jack run
With all the little piggies in a row
They come, they go
Does anyone give a damn
Who I am or where I 'm going

No one's as sane as everyone else
And there'll be hell to pay one fine day"

Where the water runs out my soul
When you sing for me

Mama D. wears a dark brown coat in the sun
The light in her eyes burns so strong
And the melody
Heals me, Mama D.
Set me free, Mama D.

She won't bring you down
If you're shit outta luck 
She can't live it down
Might as well live it up

1312,Mr. Big,Merciless,"Shake the waist, you got to love that taste and
Smell the rain, what a shame to let her get away
Tie me down to the race-car tracks
Smack dab in the middle of lover's lane
Zip the lipstick on like BBQ sauce
Painted lady, got to slip into something that's comfortable
Hey.. you can look but you better not touch
Shut down the motors, pull back in the clutch

That strut is merciless 
Oh, oh only one word to define it
Merciless oh, oh I can't deny 
That strut is merciless
Worth the weight in double trouble
Merciless oh, oh strut your stuff

What's your pick-up line, I bet ya tell her she's fine
If that don't work, don't you pack your suitcase up tonight
Don't give up, here comes a big surprise
It's more than enough to keep me satisfied

Crack the whip, baby, twist your hips
I do as I see fit, love to lick your lips a little bit
You can run, but you better not hide
There goes the dream into the lights
	
The last thing I remember 
After that hard slap in the face
I was lying there thinkin' 
As she turned and walked away...Merciless"

Don't need nobody to tell me about a girl of mine
She's got so much love, saved it all for me

So Mr. Big
Better watch out
And don't you hang around me now
That all for you, I would dig
A great big hole in the ground

I don't care who you are, so don't explain
Better get on out of here, and don't you come back again
I don't want a thing from ya', don't wanna give you nothing too
So get on out of here before I lose my cool

Better watch out

1314,Mr. Big,Mr. Gone,"You feel a tap upon your shoulder
Turn around there's no one there
Is your mind just getting older
Are you whispering a prayer
When you feel you're someone else
In the crowd all by yourself
Love, choice and destiny knocked on your door
You were gone
Sold your world to keep it free
Are you lonely tonight Mr. Gone?

Twist your heart up over nothing
Your will is working double time
Intuition has misled you
She's polite, but so unkind
When you feel you're someone else
In the crowd all by yourself
Love, choice and destiny knocked on your door
You were gone
Sold your world to keep it free
Are you lonely tonight Mr. Gone?

Where's you love
Where's your life
Get your head out of the sand
Free your mind
Free your soul
An open heart will understand
Everything is cool
Mr. Gone
We need love
Mr. Gone
We gotta make a change
Mr. Gone
Love, choice and destiny knocked on your door
You were gone
Sold your world to keep it free

Lose your personality
When all of your rights turn to wrong
Blinded by the things you see
Are you lonely tonight Mr. Gone?"
1315,Mr. Big,Mr. Never in a Million Years,"I was up and sown all night,
Thoughts stick to me like glue
Sometimes the sunrise doesn't look so good
When the sun sets down on you
Too much talkin' about it
Was it money or was it love
You put yourself up on a pedestal,
Now you can watch from up above

Look at the man in the mirror
All the wasted love, sweat and tears
Now you're 'Mr. Never in a million years'

You're a D.I.Y. mister, it's been a good day in hell
Keep those cards and letters comin'
Lock them away up in a hole on the shelf

Look at the man in the mirror
All the wasted love, sweat and tears
Now you're 'Mr. never in a million years'

When it falls it falls quick
Only smile when you think you should
When you piss in the well
Don't complain about the water not tastin' so good

Look at the man in the mirror
All the wasted love, sweat and tears
You had it and it all disappeared
All the wasted love, sweat and tears
Now you're 'Mr. never in a million years'"
1316,Mr. Big,My Kinda Woman,"Way back in the early days 1946
She walked in with the look o' love
That girl had bedroom eyes
Fire engine lipstick lips
All heads turned ooh with a human desire
It set the world on fire

My kinda woman
Someone's yesteryear dreams
That's my kinda woman
I could tear down the silver screen

A fallen woman femme fatale
Her body screamed heartbreak
Hotel... brains and beauty
Break down the walls, I fall
Down, to my knees,
When I see her picture in the movie magazines
All heads turned ooh for the lady in red
Bring up the house light and say

My kinda woman
Bring back those yesteryear dreams
My kinda woman help me
Tear down the silver screen

Picture perfect 
X marks the spot
There's just no way
To tell you how hot
My kinda woman

If I could go back in time
To the right place eye to eye
Magic to burn ooh with a human desire
She set the world on fire

My kinda woman
Someone's yesteryear dreams
My kinda woman
I could tear down the silver screen
My kinda woman
Bring back those yesteryear dreams
And that's my kinda woman
Help me tear down the silver screen

1317,Mr. Big,My New Religion,"Fears is a thief in the night
It leaves you hopeless
I believe it dreamed, I believe in flying
I am what I am, what I am
And I'm sorry if I displease you
What am I fighting for 
It's not my war

Till today I was in my way
Clouding up the lens
Of my own vision

I gave up on magic wands
For the right to get it wrong
And brave the world's collisions
I'll turn out the crystal ball
If I stumble I will crawl
It's my new religion

I'd rather be banging my head
Even if it kills me
I believe in chance,
I believe in crashing
Better you're true to yourself
Than a perfect shadow
Of somebody else
An empty shell

Here today I'm gonna run my own way
Somehow I don't need your permission"
1318,Mr. Big,Never Say Never,"I wanna know was it love or money
Come clean tell the truth about what you've done
Why did you gibe your love to another man?
Girl, I believed you were the one

I shoulda known I'd be caught in the middle
No way out-no alibis
I've tried my best but I don't understand
What's so good about long goodbyes-ya

Never say never
Cuz now we're together
We'll keep holdin' on 'till the end
One look in your eyes and I knew I'd decided
To never say never again-never again

Gonna win one way or another
No holds barred-It's just a matter of time
Second time around I've got it covered
I'm ready if ya wanna give me one more try-ya

Never say never
Cuz I still remember
How we thought that lover never ends
Through good times and bad times
It's always a fine line
I'll never say never again

So far so good
You showed me how love is misunderstood
Whatever it takes
I've made some mistakes
But never again

Never say never
Cuz now we're together
We'll keep holdin' on till the end 
One look in you eyes and I knew I'd decided
To never say never again-never again

1319,Mr. Big,Not One Night,"I used to dream of only you
Now I don't do that.
I used to miss talkin' to you
Oh, now I don't do that.

Since you've been gone I learned to stop
Tryin' to hold on because

there's not one night, one single day
That I wouldn't give to you.
So with all my might in every way,
I'll try to forget you too.

I thought you could tell me anything
Yeah, you used to do that.
You let me inside of everything
Yeah, you used to do that.

Never to change at least I thought
It feels so strange because

there's not one night, one single day
That I wouldn't give to you.
So with all my might in every way,
I'll try to forget you too.

Loneliness may come knockin' at my door
Where I'm comin' from that don't phase me anymore.
Time has shed a little light on where I'm supposed to be
There ain't no used in thinking you'll come running back to me.

Since you've been gone I learned to stop

Nothing but love will start

You can swear to God that it's over
Tell a clipped heart to play dead
There's no way to stop looking over your shoulder
There's nothing like it in the world
There's nothing like the weight when it's lifted
There's nothing like a dream where you learn how to fly
I know for sure, 'cause I've been there before
There's nothing like it in the world
Somewhere in a smile there's an invitation
Calling you back into the dance
You can't deny such a high from a beautiful moment
There's nothing like it in the world
There's nothing like the weight when it's lifted
There's nothing like the weight when it's lifted
There's nothing like a dream where you learn how to fly
I know for sure, 'cause I've been there before
There's nothing like it in the world

Us and them and me and you, piling up so much to do
All the colors start to fade to gray, an ordinary day is just 
One world away

Try to five them what they want, You're stuck inside that same old state of grace
All we are all we seem, a noisy dream inside a quiet place

Till the love is almost gone
This time she's given up
Still in a state of shock
I should have seen it coming on
It's too late for waking up

Her mind's made up I know
The dream is over
But my heart just can't let go

She's too good to be forgotten
Too good to be true
Before my world is torn apart
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon

I was too blind to notice her
Wrapped up in myself
Working hard overtime, night and day
I thought we were so secure
Can't imagine someone else
Could come between us and take her away

Her mind's made up I know
The dream is over
But my heart just can't let go

She's too good to be forgotten
Too good to be true
Before my world is torn apart
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon

And all the times that she stood by me
I never said I love you
But I kept it deep down in my soul
And all the while I've been a fool"

Feel like it's going to waste
25 years, Seven Impossible days

Monday morning I'll never find
Someone with strength to betray
25 years, seven impossible days

People are walking, leaving behind
Someone who wants them to stay
Everyone's talking out of their mind
See that thay gone, afraid that they coming to stay

Friday morning got through the grind
Find me a woman who lays
My head to bed in seven impossible ways

People are walking, leaving behind
Someone who wants them to stay
Everyone's talking out of their mind
See that thay gone, afraid that they coming to stay

Sunday Morning out of my mind
Feel like it's going to waste
25 years, Seven Impossible Days

Seven Impossible Days

Maybe on your own you take a cautious step
Till you want to give it up, but all I want is for you to 
Shine, shine down on me 
Shine on this life that's burnin' out

I say a lot of things sometimes that don't come out right
And I act like I don't know why
I guess a reaction's all I was lookin' for
When you look through me, you really knew me, like no one else ever looked before

Maybe on your own you take a cautious step
Till you want to give it up, but all I want is for you to
Shine, shine down on me
Shine on this life that's burnin' out ( I know , I know, know yougot somethin' )

Shine on this life that's burnin' out

Maybe on your own you take a cautious step
Till you want to give up, but all I want is for you to 
Shine, shine down on me ( just show me something )
Shine on this life that's burnin' out ( you give me something that I've never known )
Shine ( if you could show me the way ) shine down on me ( I want to know what's going on in your life )

That our paths should have crossed so young
Who's to blame
For the tears and the damage done

All I know
Is I can't forget the time we had
And I'm sorry if it turned out bad

Even though I want you
Even though I need you
Even though my heart is screaming
Still believing
We could fall in love

Even though I want you
Even though I need you
Even though we won't find better
We can't stay together

Tell me why
There were secrets you never told oh, no
It's a crime
The cliche of a love gone old

All I know
Is I've given all I can to you
And there's nothing more that I can do

Even though I want you
Even though I need you
Even though my heart is screaming
Still believing
We could fall in love

Even though I want you
Even though I need you
Even though we won't find better
We can't stay together

It's all right
Happiness only comes to few
But in time you may find it in someone new

Solo

Even though I want you
Even though I need you
Even though my heart is screaming
Still believing
We could fall in love

Even though I want you
Even though I need you
Even though we won't find better
We can't stay together

Stay together
Stay together
Ow!

Back in your head

You're not happy 'til the chain's
Wrapped 'round my leg

Makes me wonder if time is a bullet

Another pencil in the drawer
Tripping over echoes in my head
Wishing I was someone else instead
Makes me wonder if time is my hero
And everything will come around again

1348,Mr. Big,Wild World,"Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you want to start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving
Baby I'm greaving

But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of things turn bad out there

Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl

You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
'Cause I never want to see you sad girl
Don't be a bad girl

But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl

Baby I love you, but if you want to leave take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

It's hard to get by just just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl"
1349,Mr. Big,Wind Me Up,"There ought to be a law against it
To lead a man on and then let him go
What's the world comin' to
When you can't slide into home?

Tell it like it is woman
Tell the boy maybe or never mind
We could go all the way
The big boys don't like to waste time
	
[Chorus]
Wind me up
I need enough to keep me satisfied
Wind me up
I want to hold you, but my hands are tied
Wind me up
You kiss me quick and then 
You turn me off
Wind me up

The only way she winds you up 
Is when you ask for too much trouble
Ain't no room for a second chance 
When the first one ain't even over

Packed with a powerful love
That I just can't get enough of
Lay your cards on the table
Baby, make no mistake about it

Lead solo
Breakdown sexual jargon

It's time to let the cat out of the bag"
1350,Mr. Big,Woman from Tokyo (Baba O'Riley),"Fly into the rising sun,
Faces, smiling everyone
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition
I feel it in my heart

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

Talk about her like a Queen
Dancing in a Eastern Dream
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river
That carries me away

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

But I'm at home and I just don't belong 

So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in Her City of light

Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire
I get high

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

1351,Poison,#1 Bad Boy,"What you heard about me
Was probably right
I'm the boy next door
The one you were warned about
Oh yes, indeed

Well, I'm no upstanding citizen
but I'm standing up just the same

[Chorus]
Number one bad boy
who's to blame
Number one bad boy
Ain't that a shame
Yeah, right

All my friends are two faced
And I'm a social disgrace
I got no morals
Don't belong in the rat race

Well, I'm no upstanding citizen
but I'm standing up just the same

Into a lonely world
Where I'm lost without a trace
Two faced
rat race
disgrace

Will I stand up on my own?
Will I fall on my face?

[Chorus]"
1352,Poison,(Flesh & Blood) Sacrifice,"Like animals
Tonight we make it
You give me an inch
I'm gonna take it

I'll steal your love
Like a thief
To be as one
Is my belief

Don't look back and have no regrets
Like beasts of prey we must feed on it
I'll be your one, your one and only
To feel me burn come close and hold me

Flesh and blood sacrifice
Melts the heart like fire and ice
Flesh and blood like fire to ice
Are you willing to sacrifice

There's no more time
Don't think about
The flame will die
If you doubt

It's a game of
Love and hate
To lose it all's
A chance we take

Come to me and take my hand
It's in the fire that we must stand
I'll take you down under my gun
Our flesh and blood will be as one

Flesh and blood sacrifice
Melts the heart like fire and ice
Flesh and blood like fire to ice
Are you willing to sacrifice

Our blood runs deeper than a river
The less you need the more I'm gonna give you
And give you but good

Flesh and blood sacrifice
Melts the heart like fire and ice
Flesh and blood like fire to ice
Are you willing to sacrifice

Flesh and blood sacrifice
Melts the heart like fire and ice
Flesh and blood like fire to ice
Are you willing to sacrifice

Flesh and blood sacrifice
Melts the heart like fire and ice
Flesh and blood like fire to ice
Are you willing to sacrifice"
1353,Poison,7 Days over You,"Well it's Friday night and I'm waiting
On your call girl, like I do
Am I wasting my time by this telephone line
Waiting on your call to come through

[Chorus]
I should be already over you
Tell me Mama, what can I do
It's been a long hard road that you put me through
Seven days over you
Seven days, seven days over you
Seven days over you

Kick it

I kick and fight for you baby
But that's never enough for you
You've been twisted and torn since the day you were born
You make a game of breaking hearts in two

Now I want to give up but I dig the rush too much
I guess that's what love will do
So drag your heart-stopping mind trip downtown, girl
By Friday night I'll find someone new

[Chorus]

Lord knows what you put me through

Already over you, tell me mama what can I do
Already over you, tell me mama what can I do

[Chorus]"
1354,Poison,Ain't That the Truth,"Now pardon my personal demons, child but if you do insist
Sit down and listen to me story awhile, cause it goes something like this

The joint was small but we were having a ball
At a place called the Blue Duck Inn
When I couldn't help but notice her
My future wife walked in

I needed me a dose of her, so I got a little closer
And this is what she said
My old man stands about six foot five
And if he catches you, you're dead

Now I don't need none of that 
giving me the blues
The old man sitting next to me said
Son, let me tell you

[Chorus]
Life, you just can't fake it
Love, you gotta make it
Time, you better take it
Lord, ain't that the truth
Hear me out
Your heart will surely feel it
Women come and steal it
Time can only heal it
Lord, ain't that the truth

I save Friday night for the ladies
Saturday night for my gin
Come Sunday morning, I'm asking the good Lord
To forgive me for my sins

Lately my heave-ho get-up-and-go
Wouldn't get me out of bed
I felt like some big wrecking ball
Done hit upside my head

Now I don't need a preacher man
Telling me how to run my life
Until an angel sitting next to me
said son, heed my advice. She said

[Chorus]

You better get your story straight
What comes around goes around

[Chorus]"
1355,Poison,Baby Gets Around a Bit,"I can't say I ain't been around
That I ain't done my time
Seems like this big old world
Has been one big shoe to shine

But I never ever took a dime
For what comes naturally
And if I never knew the truth
Well shed be fine with me

One night she stayed over here
And left her little black book behind
Well that little black book ain't little no more
And it wasn't too hard too find

[Chorus]
Shed leave me in this lonely room
The thought just made me sick
Its funny how the pieces fit
My baby gets around a bit
Yeah, my baby gets around a bit

Her pager would ring, its a funny thing
Shed have to go right away
She always had a wad of cash
Much more than her job could pay

Id ask her where she's going to
And this is what shed say
I gotta meet someone for an interview
He's only in town today

Always a little bit overdressed
Much more than I thought he'd be
High heel shoes and day glow dress
Ain't seem strange to me

Shed leave me in this lonely room
While some stud got his sex
Just then the thought occurred to me
My baby gets around a bit
My baby gets around a bit
Ooh, my baby gets around a bit

Took her to the local bar
Where I like to hang
Every guy that passed her by
They all seemed to know her name

They all called her by a different name
And one of them winked at me
Some guy named stan said you're the man
I heard you get it for free

Shed leave me in this lonely room
And the thought hit me like a brick
Its funny how the pieces fit
My baby gets around a bit
Ooh, my baby gets around a bit
Ooh, my baby gets around a bit
My baby gets around a bit

My baby gets around
My baby"
1356,Poison,Back to the Rocking Horse,"Like this

All the king's horses
And all the king's men
Ain't got a hope in hell
Of puttin' my pieces back together again

I've seen things in my life that should never be seen
I'm talkin' things that'd make your skin crawl
I want to go back to a simpler time
Where nothin' really mattered at all

You see, I can't sleep all night long
Tossin' and a-turnin'
Thoughts they keep a-churnin'
I can't sleep all night long
As a matter of fact
I just want to get back

Back to the rockin' horse
Back to where it all began
Take me back, back to the rockin' horse
And start all over again, get back

Parents think I'm crazy
And the doctor says I cracked
But they don't understand me
'Cause I just want to go back

You see I can't sleep all night long
Tossin' and a-turnin
Thoughts they keep a-churnin'
I can't sleep all night long
As a matter of fact
I just want to get back

Back to the rockin' horse
Back to where it all began
Take me back, back to the rockin' horse
And start all over again, one time

Well, the whole world thinks I'm crazy
And the doctor says I cracked
But they don't understand me, no
'Cause I just want to go back

You see, I can't sleep all night long

Getting back, back to the rockin' horse
Back to where it all began
Take me back, back to the rockin' horse
And start all over again like this"
1357,Poison,Bad to Be Good,"There's an alley cat slowly walkin' down a dirty street
Watching a cop on the take marching to his city beat
You got Five-fingers Johnny stealing everything in sight
You gotta be bad to be good in the dead of the night
Kick it

You're dancing in fire, baby
When you're takin' it to the streets
Yeah, to the streets
Baby, better watch your back
Fast on your feet

'Cause they're wheelin', dealin'
Cheatin', stealin'
Child, you're gonna learn

You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that?
So I say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
In the dead of the night

When you got nothin', baby
You got nothin' to lose, nothin' to lose
It's an eye for an eye, baby
And a tooth for a tooth
Ain't it the truth?

If you got nine lives, you might survive
'Cause nothing's free on the other side

You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that?
So I say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
In the dead of the night

Wheelin', dealin', cheatin', stealin'
Just to stay alive
They got love for sale, yes, for sale
On the New York subway line
Watch the working girls hanging out
Turning tricks underneath the lights
The lights

One step from Hell
The poor men sell their soul
For a taste of wine

You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that?
So I say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
In the dead of the night

When it's said and done
And you're on the run
And the only law comes under the gun"
1358,Poison,Ball and Chain,"Come on, come on
Get on your dress and put on a smile
Lets lose this place 
and get out awhile, awhile, awhile

Just a whole lot of attitude
I'll be your man now baby
If you're doing what I want you to do

I keep on tellin' ya

She's my ball and chain
My lock and key
And I'm liking it baby
She's my ball and chain
My lock and key
And I'm liking it good

I'll t-t-t-tell ya
Momma always said
There was plenty of fish in the sea
So I baited my hook but good
And caught one for me, just for me

She'll set you up with her body
And then knock you out with charm
She's just a little too nasty baby
But that never did me no harm, no
I keep on telling ya

And she'll always be wrapped tight around me
I t-t-t-tell ya"
1359,Poison,Bastard Son of a Thousand Blues,"Well it's four o'clock in the morning
And I'm knocking on your door
She says she's tired of me
Don't want me here no more

She said stop your pissin' and moanin' and groanin'
Go sleep outside with them dogs
Now honey let me please explain
'Cause I didn't mean you no wrong

I didn't mean to hurt you baby
Wouldn't do that to you
She said bite your lip, now, sweet child
You're the bastard son of a thousand blues

Well my Daddy was gone by the day I was born
And my Mama I have never seen
I was born in the back of a black Cadillac
And raised by a Gypsy queen

And as a child I was hell gone wild
Raised in the eye of a storm
By the time I was ten I was doing time again
'Cause I knew what that gun was for

No, no, no, I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues
No, no, no, Don't know what I'm going to do
No, no, no, I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues
No, no, no, Tell me, mama, what I'm going to do

Ladies have come and ladies have gone
But there's one I remember quite well
Years have gone past, but her memory lasts
But the story I cannot tell

Well I've lived and I've lied
And I've loved and I've tried
To put my soul to good use

Guess I'm shit out of luck
Cause that name, it just stuck
I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues, dig

No, no, no, I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues
No, no, no, Don't know what I'm going to do
No, no, no, I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues
No, no, no, Tell me, mama, what I'm going to do"
1360,Poison,Be the One,"So you want to talk about the pain
Talk to me, please explain
Maybe I know what your going through

You got so much pain to hide
You keep it locked up deep inside
In a room no one gets to

I can't feel the way you feel
Maybe i, I've got those same scars, same scars to heal
Wish you've got to understand
I want to be the only man to
Ever touch you baby
To ever

I'll be there should the sun go down
Lift you up to a higher ground
Let me in, let me be the one
I'll be there should you fall from grace
Wipe those tear drops from your face
I see no more damage done
Baby, baby,
Just let me be the one

I want to be the one to show to you? 
Should the rains come down
Never let you drown
I'll pull you through

I want to hear you when you scream
Be your prince when you dream
Hold you close when you cry

I said
I want to feel your love, your hate
Should you be lost, I'll bear your cross of pain
Love seal your fate
I'll comfort you in fits of rage
I'll be the book you can turn the page, and
I'll still love baby
I'll still

I gotta touch you I'll see no more damage done
You gotta let me

1361,Poison,Best Thing You Ever Had,"(yeah, blues!)
I won't ask where you're going
If you don't ask where I've been
'cause if you're looking for an answer, babe
I wouldn't know where to begin.

I don't know what I want sometimes
But I sure know what I likes
You've got that thing about you
Gets me hot inside

If it makes no sense when I wrote this song
Cause half way through it you were turning me on

[Chorus #1:]
Lay me down
I just might be your kind
I'll show you a better way
We can do away the time
If you stop looking so hard
I think you just might find
I ain't finding it so bad
Might be the best thing you ever had

You know a little 'bout love and
I know a lot about hate
I believe you gotta make things happen
You believe in fate

But this won't be the first time that
We didn't see eye to eye
You may not be religious but I'll make you see god
If you give me a try

I know love can get me through it
If you give me that look we'll get down to it

Chorus #2:]
Don't shoot me down
I'm not a social disease
You've got that thing about you
Bring a grown man to his knees
I'll teach you baby
'bout them birds and them bees
When you get around
And think about it ain't so bad
Might be the best thing you ever had
Best thing I ever had

[Solo]
Ah, give me some of that!

When I put out the dog
Ya get them old ghosts out of bed.....
I ain't looking for a little to say
Baby some place to lay my head

I'm the one to right your wrong
If you give me a chance and I'll turn you on

1362,Poison,Blame It on You,"She's got pizazz
Like a razzmatazz
I'd like to slide it in
But where do I begin

Wastes all my money
Spends all my time
I ain't got no luck
Can't change her mind

Blame it on you
I can't stand up
Blame it on you
I'm keepin' my mouth shut
Blame it on you
I can't see straight
Blame it on you
Uh-oh, too late

I want a little reaction
How 'bout a kiss or two?
She said, ""Jump back honey,""
I said, ""no can do.""

Why do you always make a fool out of me?
I can't get no nookie
Just plain to see

Wastes all my money
Spends all my time
I ain't got no luck
Can't change her mind

Blame it on you
I can't get no sleep
Blame it on you
I'm in six feet deep
Blame it on you
Well I guess it's true
Blame it on you
Yes, I do

I blame this whole damn mess, honey
Right on you

Now listen little girl, let me explain
Why you got me in such a terrible way
She's got pizazz

1363,Poison,Blind Faith,"In a smoky room
Could have been a devil's tomb
90 miles east of LA

Feeling desperate and cold
Barely 19 years old
Searching for the light in the pouring rain

I visualize the cold reality
If I don't try, the answer dies inside of me

[Chorus]
Blind faith takes me to the mountains
Blind faith lead me to the sea
Blind faith takes me to a higher ground
Come on, come on, come on, and help me find my way

In a small town school
Caught between the liars and fools
She spent her days thinking about her life

She was full of dreams and doubts
searching for that one way out
Didn't want to spend the rest of her days being a small town wife

She could visualize the life she wants to lead
But deep inside, she didn't have the heart it takes to leave

[Chorus]

I just got to get myself out of here
We visualize the life we want to lead
But deep inside got to find a reason to believe

1364,Poison,Body Talk,"Like this I've never seen a woman baby
That looks quite the way you do
The way you shake that thing now honey,
Can't take my eyes off you

The way you work it honey
It brings me to my knees
You give me what I'm looking for,
I'll give you what you need
And I said

[Chorus]
I got the one thing you want,
Get it all night long
You got the one thing I need,
When your body talks
I hear it talking to me
Say, get it all night long
Woman why can't you see
You're my one thing

I got a world of trouble, baby
It's going on inside my head
Playing your game, got me half insane
Trying to make sense of every word you said

Stop beating around the bush
You're just wasting time
Let's get down to the business honey
And lay it one the line
And I said

[Chorus]

Tell me the news,
Let's hear your story
You think you got nothing to lose
You better use it up
Before it gets old, baby
And becomes yesterday's news

1365,Poison,Bring It Home,"Stand and rise and before your eyes 
The lions will appear
And when they do they'll be filling you 
With all the lies you will need to hear

Mr. Politician, just keep on dishin' 
Your shit for the TV screen
Turn off his camera, he'll drop the propaganda 
Faster than the poverty that he just seen

Got to bring it home
We got to bring it home

See his campaign run by the power funds
And makin' all the deals he can
Isn't it funny what greed and money
Can do to the soul of a man

We don't seen nothin', hear nothin'
Just get their news stuffed down our throats at 10
Makes it hard to conceive who the fuck to believe
When I don't see no means to an end

We got to bring it home
I don't know what to believe
We got to bring it home
Don't you think you're fooling me
We got to bring it home
In this world that's grown so cold
We got to bring it home
We will never know until we bring it home

Watch the walls around come tumbling down
Like a house that's built on a hill
How can we change a thing or even get in the ring
If we're living our lives in guilt

We don't see it comin' hear it comin'
Acting like we know nothing, chills me to the bone
Sure as hell stop foolin' ourselves
Till we bring it home

[Chorus]

Time has come now to bring it home
We got to get it home
Time has come now to bring it home
We got to get it home
The truth we will never find
Until we bring it home"
1366,Poison,Can't Bring Me Down,"My chick is driving me crazy
She thinks that I'm lazy
Just because I'm good at nothing all day

My baby don't get it
So my job, I quit it
Bust my ass,
Hell I barely get paid

People like to put me down
And just because I hang around
Don't they understand it's my way?

Everybody tries to break me
Say they love me when they hate me
Baby you just can't bring me down
I've seen long and lonely days
And I have lost and found my ways
So baby you just can't bring me down

Yeah, bring me down

Baby I'm leaving
You've got my heart bleeding
So I'm taking the easier way out

The angel in my head
Is now the devil in my bed
If my walls could talk they would shout

Baby you can talk and talk
The hurt you caused, it just don't stop
I think I'm going out of my brain

[Chorus]

I got a car, it go fast
Cute fuzzy dice up on the dash
Got a bumper sticker, just say ""peace""
Keep a gun under my seat
To protect me from the pain
Should your words get in my brain
Can't you love me just the same
Can't you love me just the

I've got no regrets
Who they think they're kidding
They ain't seen nothing yet

You point my finger try to tell me I'm wrong
That never stopped me from singin' my song
I got the last laugh at the things they do
Eliminate them at the turn of a screw

I never lived by nobody's rules
I won't be sinking on that ship of fools
Can't push me no matter how hard they try
Stand back, it's my turn to fly

Come hell, hell or high water
Nothing's gonna hold me down
Come hell, hell or high water
Ain't no body messin' me around

I see their wicked ways
and miles of endless lies
Their jaded lives 
Couldn't erase my smile

But what's this shit that I just heard
Son of a bitch you're working on my nerves
I'll watch you choke on your last words
It's about time you got what you deserved

I never lived by nobody's rules
I won't be sinking on that ship of fools
Can't push me no matter how hard they try
Stand back, it's my turn to fly

[Chorus]

I've got something that's been on my mind
Come close I'll tell you the problem that I find
I'm sick and tired of the damage you've done
Don't blame me I ain't the one
Blame yourself for the ghosts in your past
Kiss my ass

1368,Poison,Cover of the Rolling Stone,"Coughing, Blues?: ""Gol, Bret--don't touch me there!""
Bret: I'm gonna tell you who we are.

Well we're big rock singers
we got golden fingers
And we're loved everywhere we go
(That sounds like us)

We sing about beauty
and we sing about truth
At ten million dollars a show
(Yeah, right!)

We take all kinda pills
That give us all kinda thrills
But the thrill we've never known
Is the thrill that it gets ya
when you get your picture 
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

[Chorus]
Rolling Stone
I'm gonna see my picture on the cover
Stone
Gonna buy five copies for my mother
Stone
Gonna see my smiling face
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

I got a freaky old lady named Cocaine Katie
Who embroiders on my jeans
I got my poor old gray-haired Daddy
Driving my limousine.

Now it's all designed to blow our minds,
But our minds won't really be blown
Like the blow that'll getcha
When you get your picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

[Chorus]
Spoken: Hey, I know how!!!
Solo
Spoken: Beautiful!

We gotta lot of little teen-aged 
blue-eyed groupies
Who do anything we say
We got a genuine Indian Guru
He's teaching us a better way

We got all the friends that money can buy,
So we never have to be alone
And we keep gettin' richer,
But we can't get our picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone
[
Chorus]

I don't know why we ain't on the cover, baby!
Ah we're beautiful fellas!
I ain't kiddin' you man, we'd make a beautiful cover
I mean, I can see it right now--we be up front, 
Oh, we be smilin'... Beautiful!"
1369,Poison,Cry Tough,"Remember the nights we sat
And talked about all our dreams
Well little did we know then
They were more distant than they seemed
Well I, well I knew it
You knew it too
The things we'd go through, well
We knew the things we had to do
To make it, baby

You gotta cry tough
Out on the streets
To make your dreams happen
You gotta cry out
Out to the world
To make them all come true

Life ain't no easy ride
At least that's what I am told
Sometimes the rainbow baby
Is better than the pot of gold
You've got to stick it out
Whether you're wrong or right
And you can't give in without a fight
To make it baby

You gotta cry tough
Out on the streets
To make your dreams happen
You gotta cry out
Out to the world
To make them all come true

You gotta aim high, baby
Whether you lose or win
And when you get to the top
You gotta get off or go right back down again

You gotta cry tough
Out on the streets
To make your dreams happen
You gotta cry out
Out to the world
To make them all come true, well

You gotta cry tough
Out on the streets
To make your dreams happen
You gotta cry out
Out to the world
To make them all come true

You gotta cry tough
Out on the streets
To make your dreams happen
You gotta cry out
Out to the world
To make them all come true

You gotta cry tough
Out on the streets
To make your dreams happen
You gotta cry out
Out to the world
To make them all come true"
1370,Poison,Devil Woman,"Mr. Rockett, give me some drums!

She'll slide you in, you taste the sin
She slowly gets inside your head
You feel her take control and she'll steal your soul
She's the devil lying in your bed
She's the lord of your thighs and it's no surprise
You're playing with loaded gun
She's a killer queen and she'll lick you clean
Then she'll spit you out when she's done

[Chorus]
Devil woman, evil woman
She'll make you believe
L.A. woman, she's my woman
Brings out the devil in me

She got blood red lips and head trips
Leave a poor boy beggin' for more
When you get that itch ain't love a bitch
Now you need her just a little more
She's a soul taker, a ball breaker
And boy she's gonna break you
She's gonna steal your heart, steal your money
Laugh at you when she's through

[Chorus]

[Chorus: x2]

Well the way she'll do you
Things you ain't never seen
She can tear right through you
You can never leave

1371,Poison,Doin' as I Seen on My TV,"When I was a child staring at the tube
I saw sex, violence and death on the news
One day I saw the Duke kill someone
Daddy said don't worry boy, they're just acting son

All I want is attention from somebody
Somebody pay attention to me
Like them actors I got no shame
I want my fifteen minutes of fame

Doin' as I see on my TV
Doin' as I see on my TV

Can I get on the news if I kill my wife?
Would you respect me more if I took my life?
I tried to act and my career just flopped
So I beat up my neighbors and I got on ""Cops""

All I want's a millions bucks from somebody
Somebody pay a million bucks to me

I could shoot and rape and kill
And buy me a house in Beverly Hills, please?

Doin' as I see on my TV
Doin' as I see on my TV

I'd even do a porno flick, like all them Hollywood chicks
I'm doin' it as I see on my TV

Took my girl to rent a porno movie
I thought that it'd be kinda groovy
I thought that'd this impress my lover
And there she was right on the cover!

All I want is attention from somebody
Somebody pay attention to me
I'm a man I got no shame
I want my fifteen minutes of fame

Doin' as I see on my TV
Doin' as I see on my TV

Hell I'd even do a porno flick, like my hero Rocky did

Doin' as I see on my TV

I am not aware!"
1372,Poison,Don't Give up an Inch,"Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for the mile
Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for a mile

Miles from home and I'm all alone
And looking for a first time
We took a long ride
And there by your side
I did my first crime

Well Mary Mary quite contrary
Just how does your garden grow
She said you ring my bell
And rattle my shell
I'll be your pretty maid all in a row

Put me to the test
Lay me down to rest
While your nails cut me up like a knife
Put me in you like a flesh tattoo
And scarred this poor boy for life

Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for the mile
Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for a mile

It was a hot one
In the summer sun
And more than heat was rising
I remember that September
And just how you left me smiling

I left there shaken
Body was achin'
Like it never did before

Begged and pleaded
Swear I needed
Needed you a whole lot more

Put me to the test
Lay me down to rest
While your nails cut me up like a knife
Put me in you like a flesh tattoo
And scarred this poor boy for life

Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for the mile
Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for a mile

Made this boy's bell ring
And there I earned my wings
Left me there in sweet pain
Hell I'll never be the same

Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for the mile
Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for a mile"
1373,Poison,Emperor's New Clothes,"Now that you've been bought and sold
You don't have time to fix the mess you're in
And if I may be so bold I bet you couldn't even do it again

Lying like yesterday's paper just outside the door

*chorus*
Now you need me to clean your shoes
Walk on water be in the mood
Everybody's talking but nobody knows
Where did the emperor get them new clothes

I alwayd did look up to you
Tried to copy everything that you did
Until you broke my heart in two
You shot me up then you flipped your lid

1374,Poison,Every Rose Has Its Thorn,"We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does
I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn"
1375,Poison,Fallen Angel,"She stepped off the bus out into the city streets
Just a small town girl with her whole life
Packed in a suitcase by her feet
But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright as they did
On her mama's TV screen
And the work seemed harder
And the days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

But you know you got to stick to your guns
When it all comes down
'Cause sometimes you can't choose
It's like heads they win
Tail you're gonna lose

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Now she found herself in the fast lane
Livin' day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And watched her family slip away
And just like a lost soul
Caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and limousines

Such a good actress
Hiding all her pain
Trading in memories for fortune and fame
Just a step away from the edge of the fall
Caught between Heaven and Hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Too much too soon
Or just a little too late
'Cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel"

Well my baby she just loves to play
And I need my baby each and every day

I want to go
I want to go home now

Saturday night Rainbow bar and grill
Where there's Cocaine lines and a little white pill
A beer and a gin, now I can't see straight
Slip it in, no glove, oops too late
I remember her face but forgot her name
She forgot mine too ain't that a shame
Smelled like reefer and my hairs in a mess
I left my love running down her dress

Dave from Drowning Pool is here
Steal's my women and he drinks my beer
Buys me a pizza and a shot of Jim Beam

I go to piss in the parking lot well
I get in a fight but I don't get caught
Hell no problem 'cause the nights still young
I want a little more gonna get ya some

I want to go
I want to go home now
I want to go
I want to go home now

I eat dinner with Nick Cage and Charlie Sheen
Nick asks me what the hell Unskinny Bop means
It's slang for CC banging a porno queen

1379,Poison,I Want Action,"I want action tonight, satisfaction all night

I grab my hat and I grab my shoes
Tonight I'm gonna hit the streets and cruise
Down the main strip and check it out
With those schoolgirls a hangin' around
I'm a sucker for a pretty face
I don't care if she's in leather or lace
'Cause I'm just lookin' for a little kiss

I want action tonight, satisfaction all night
You've got the love I need tonight

Long legs and short skirts
These girls hit me where it hurts
I can't wait to get my hands on them
I won't give up until they give in
Not lookin' for a love that lasts
I need a shot and I need it fast
If I can't have her, I'll take her and make her

I want action tonight, satisfaction all night
You've got the love I need tonight

Hey, sweetheart, slide on in here
No, not in the front, jump in the back, why?
'Cause there's something back there I want to show

I want action tonight, satisfaction all night
Ah, come on, honey, I wasn't that bad!
Ha ha ha
Oh, well
Wow wow

I want action tonight, satisfaction all night
You've got the love I need tonight
I want action tonight, satisfaction all night
You've got the love I need tonight
You've got the fruit I need to bite
You light the fuse of dynamite
All night
I Need you tonight

1380,Poison,I Won't Forget You,"Late at night I close my eyes
And think of how things could have been

Then never to have loved at all

I won't forget you baby
(I won't forget you)
Even though I could
I won't forget you baby
(I won't forget you)
Even though I should, yeah

Sometimes in my head
I can still see pictures of you
And I laugh to myself
When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

I won't forget you baby

Even though I could
I won't forget you baby

Even though I should, yeah

I should let you fade away

Just between you and me

I won't forget you baby

Even though I could
I won't forget you baby

1381,Poison,Lay Your Body Down,"I've spent my life waiting
For that famous final scene
I believe you know the one
When she falls in love with me

As for you, you've been fakin' your smile
Fillin' your time
On small talk
And cheap wine
Knowing in your heart there was some place
That you'd rather be

So right or wrong
I wrote you this song
To tell you how I feel

Don't put up no fight
You just turn off the lights
Walk over here to me

And lay your body down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah
Oh, let your tears fall down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah

As for me I've lied to, denied to
Fight with, and tried to
Apologize for all my ways
To all the women who were fool enough to fall
In love with me

You played your role
Like a movie
Got your lines for who is
Who was, who would be
Somehow you lost track
While real love slipped away, yeah

So for tonight, just turn off the lights
And let those real feelings show
There's no wrong or right
But until you try
You're never gonna know

And lay your body down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah
Oh, let your tears fall down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah

Before you was mine
I was so lonely
Ain't it a shame
Your heart must feel pain
Before you can get back on your feet again

Ooh so let's draw the blinds
Forget wasted time
And let them old demons die
Take a hold of my hand
Then you'd understand
Why love's worth one more try

And lay your body down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah
Oh, let your tears fall down on me
Down on me tonight, oh yeah

Lay your love, lay it down on me
Down on me"

Cause we all got our cross to bear

All my troubles just fade away
When I hear the music
Let it play, let it play
When I hear the music
Sure as darkness I can see the day
When I hear the music
Let it play
Let it play

Life's just rented space getting laid to waste
When the lines on my face say I'm growing older
Just a stitch in time gonna save my mind 
When the weight of the world lies on my shoulders

Soon I won't have a place to fit
But I'll cross that bridge when I come to it

make sure no one's watching me

my old man's Chevrolet
I can hear my Mama scream
from ten miles away

No matter how hard I try
This feeling won't end
So I pretend you're here by my side
Tonight on this lonely ride
Keep telling myself that

Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

You heal up my wounds
I tasted your tears
You spilled out your heart
So I let out my fears

But one fear that I kept to myself
How I prayed that you'd love no one else
Like you're saying you love me

Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do
If you only knew how much I miss you

When my mind plays these tricks on me
It shows me things I don't want to see
That's why I tell myself now
I keep telling myself now
Just take another piece of me

Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

Life goes on you're still miles away
And I need you

And this last mile I travel with you"

Feel like I can't go on
The streets have all grown cold now
The mysteries all gone

She's all gone
She's all gone, gone, gone
All gone now
She's all

Well I ain't getting any younger
Can't you see it in my eyes
She sweet has turned to sour
I think it's time for me to fly

Well my vices have turned to habits
And my habits have turned to stone
The lies chipped away at my smile now baby
While the truth ate me down to the bone

One more step and I swear
I'll be over the edge
I've gotta stop living at a pace that kills
Before I wake up dead

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times
How life loves a tragedy
Heartbreaks, heartaches
How life loves a tragedy

The nights I spent in danger
With strangers I thought were friends
Only to wake in anger
For some pleasure they swore they'd send

I think it's time I move on 
Like a rolling stone
Cause I got all the broken dreams I can buy
It's time to sell the ones I stole

[Chorus]

Well I paid the price
For every thrill I got
Those thrills are all long gone baby
But I'm still paying for them like it or not

I think it's time I move on like a rolling stone
Cause I got all the broken dreams I can buy
It's time to sell the ones I stole

1386,Poison,Livin' for the Minute ,"Two-bit Billy was the coolest guy I ever saw
Didn't want no piece of the pie, he had to take it all
With his guitar slung low hangin' right about the knee
He made the biggest scene, he made the ladies scream,
He had a snakebite smile if you know what I mean

[Chorus]
He was livin' for the minute, livin' his life from day to day
If you want it, then take it
He said that's the rules if you want to play

Magazine covers always shootin' poor Billy's face
He kept a score of his ladies chalked up on his guitar case
He was a bad-ass rockin', baby, always rollin' out the sounds
Like some freight train come and did a six-string strut and just tore the damn place to the ground

Hold tight, it'll be alright

1388,Poison,Look But You Can't Touch,"Good girls go to heaven
bad girls go to hell
The rest of them get rich
And do just what they feel

Well rich boys live in houses
And poor boys live in sin
The rest of them get married
And are never seen again

Well let me tell a story explain the shape I'm in
The girl I had last night had never tasted sin
So I took her to my hotel where I tried to get my way
She said ""Wait a minute, Bret, there's something I must say""

She said If you want to talk that's fine with me
But if you want more you'd better let me be

[Chorus]
Cause you can look but you can't touch
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap
You can look but you can't touch
Cause baby I ain't for keeps

Well maybe I'm a bad boy
OK, so I've been around the block
But I am good at one thing
And believe me it ain't talk

She says you must be kidding
I've heard this all before
Other girls might buy it
But I don't, that's for sure

Now wait a minute baby
I don't want you to go
She said ""Don't get no closer
The answer still is no""

So I wined her, dined her, fancy talked
Acted cool and smooth
Got my hands around her shoulder
Two inches from the move

Well I guess I'm about as close as I could be
So I finally made my move, she just said to me

[Chorus]

Let me show you something
Mmm, let me set the pace
Slid my hand up her leg
As she slapped me across my face

Can't blame a man for tryin'
Wantin' action ain't a crime
I didn't plan on spending money
Just to get a piece of mind"
1389,Poison,Look What the Cat Dragged In,"I went to bed too late
And got up too soon
My poor head still spinnin'
From too much booze

I got a foot in the gutter
A foot in the grave
I ain't seen home
In the last three days

Oh my god look what the cat dragged in
Livin' my life sin after sin
Night rolls up and I do it again
Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in

No tell, motel, hotel bed
If it wasn't for the sunlight I'd swear I was dead

I got a girl on the left of me
A girl on the right
I know damn well I slept with both last night

Oh my god look what the cat dragged in
Livin' my life sin after sin
Night rolls up and I do it again
Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in (sin after sin)

I'm late for work on Monday
And my boss is bitchin'
Can't get out of bed
'Cause my head's still spinnin'

My hair's in a rat's nest
I look like hell
Half alive or half dead,
I just can't tell

Oh my god look what the cat dragged in
Livin' my life sin after sin
Night rolls up and I do it again
Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in (cat dragged in)

Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in, ow, in
Look what the cat dragged

Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)

Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)
Cat dragged in (cat dragged in)

1390,Poison,Love on the Rocks,"She goes down slow like a shot of gin
She's got an angel's face and a devil's grin
She kinda stared me down as I looked her up
She said ""I'm your poison, now you drink a cup.""

In the heat of the night is when she comes alive
She's gonna push you push you til she's satisfied
I watch the ice melt fast on her red hot lips
She whispers ""If you want to taste my love
why don't you swallow this.""

[Chorus]
Love on the rocks
Love on the rocks
She's my shot
Love on the rocks
Ooooh lick it up

She gets so close you can feel her breathe
Just the way she moves, so soft and slippery
She lives just around the corner, right down the street
All night we play the horizontal bop right between her sheets

1391,Poison,Mr. Smiley,"I heard a funny thing about me
Lately I've been living on the edge
I won't say that ain't true, 
But who the hell are you
I don't recognize my own face or my friends.

[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. Smiley
Read the writing
On the wall
Wake up, Mr. Smiley
Before you don't wake 
Up at all, up at all

Today, I hired me a yes man
He simply agrees with everything I say
He does all my dirty deals
And feeds me my pills
As long as I'm still breathing he gets paid

[Chorus]

Yesterday I had a conversation
With all them voices in my head
One said I was no good
One said I should quit
One said to remind myself to get myself a fix

Hey Mr. Smiley
And I'm feeling ten feet tall
Bye Mr. Smiley
You got to go now, they just called, they just called"
1392,Poison,No More Lookin' Back ,"My friend called just the other day
Packed it up he won't be back this way

It's not your heart but the spirit they break
There's only so much a small town boy can take

See the eyes of the countless masses
Drinking life from the empty glasses

[Chorus]
No more victims
No more lies
Ne sheer heart attacks
No more empty promises
No more lookin' back

I came here loaded searching for the dream
But nothing is ever easy as it seems

I thought I got closer to it every day
But every day it just got so far away

See all the faces paled
Shot to hell when the system failed

[Chorus]

I thought I could take all the shit in grind
And stand much more pain
But see all those dead end wishes
Eats away at the brain

1393,Poison,"No Ring, No Gets","Lately boy, your head ain't right
And nothing seems to thrill you
Word on the streets is 
No sex no more 'cause, it'll kill you

You touch, she bites,
You push, she shoves
Then she yells in your ear
No glove, no love
Oh, it ruined the mood
But you know she's right
When the biggest talks and the littlest walks
You better learn how to walk the walk

[Chorus]
As far as I can see
It's really no big mystery 
It's the same old story
No ring, no gets
It ain't the boat you float
It's the motion in the ocean and I quote:
Before you start pumping that feul without your jets
No ring, no gets

This feeling coming over you
It's a variable strength of emotion
You keep thinking your smooth
Start making your move
But your lady starts causin' commotion

You want to round the bases
She knows that's for sure
But Miss Palm and her five sisters
Don't cut it no more
You know tonight you'd like to buy her a kite(?)
But the wind ain't blowing you got that right

[Chorus]

Woman hold the lock
A man's known that for years
You're going up inside to persuade that key
Could bring a man to tears

Your gun is loaded
You got her right in sight
About to pull your trigger
When the girl pulls out the lights

But keep your cool don't make a scene
Cause her ?
?

 But you won't find (repeat)..
Spoken: Shut Up!"
1394,Poison,Nothin' But a Good Time,"Now Listen
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night I'd like to make my girl
But right now I can't make ends meet

I'm always workin' slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from that same old same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

They say I spend my money on women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in
I just like my fun every now and then

I'm always workin' slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from that same old same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

You see I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breakin' our backs every day
If wantin' the good life is such a crime
Lord, then put me away
Here's to ya

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time

1395,Poison,Number One Bad Boy,"What you heard about me
Was probably right
I'm the boy next door

Well, I'm no upstanding citizen
But I'm standing up just the same

Number one bad boy
Who's to blame
Number one bad boy
Ain't that a shame
Yeah, right

All my friends are two faced
And I'm a social disgrace
I got no morals
Don't belong in the rat race

Well, I'm no upstanding citizen
But I'm standing up just the same

Into a lonely world
Where I'm lost without a trace
Two faced
Rat race
Disgrace

Will I stand up on my own?
Will I fall on my face?
What you heard about me
Was probably right
I'm the boy next door
The one you were warned about
Oh yes, indeed

Well, I'm no upstanding citizen

1396,Poison,Only Time Will Tell,"I just needed someone to hold
When the bottle was empty
and the nights grew cold

In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
You were my angel of mercy
And helped me to believe

You touched my soul 
When I was lonely
You held me up
when I couldn't fly

There's no words could explain
How I feel inside
And this I tell you

In a world full of anger
and times gone strange
You held me close
You held me close to you

Lay my head on your shoulder
I finally let it all out
It felt good for a moment
Not living in a shadow of doubt

But everybody needs a little something
Tu pull them through
I gave one for the other
And God know that the other was you

Chorus:
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love will stand
Or walk the road along

My angel of mercy
Pulled me through somehow
I just hope you know
I need you now

You're the one
That touched my very soul
The one who held on tight
God knows you never let go

Angel of mercy
It's time we closed the door
Put out the lights
And burn the fire
Burn the fire inside

Angel of mercy
You pulled me through
And this I tell to you
God know I'd tell it to you"

Billy shooting pool
Trading dirty glances
With pretty boys playing cool

They're putting down their whiskey
Getting loaded tonight
It's gettin' kind of risky
They're lookin' to fight

If you want action
If you want a thrill
Then take it down to Jimmy's bar and grill

[Chorus]
And play dirty
And dirty games too
Play dirty
Like dirty boys do

Tattoo Willie's happenin' 
He really makes a scene
He's got anything you like
If you know what I mean

Troubles up when the heat comes down
Cause down at Jimmy's 
They don't mess around

[Chorus]

Come on, man, let's take this right outside
Come on, sucker, hit it

The place is gettin' restless
There's trouble in the air
All hell's about to break loose
The dirty punks just don't care

If you want action, if you want a thrill
Then take it down to Jimmy's bar and grill

1398,Poison,Poor Boy Blues,"My daddy said
""Son, don't you come to me cryin'
Cause money don't make you a happy man""

Any place except where you stand

He said some are born to win
And some born to lose
And sing them poor boy blues

Watch out

I've lived uptown, downtown
Lord I've lived everywhere
Almost drowned in the puddle of my own sweat I swear
I believe it's due time I get my mansion in ole Bel Air

But I'm still singin' those poor boy blues
Poor boy blues
You don't know how I'm feeling baby
Until you're wearing my shoes
Sure as I'm standing here
I got them poor boy blues

Friday night I get tanked up
And tossed in the local slam
At least I get three square meals
Until someone gets me out of this jam
In the meanwhile all my green
Is going to Uncle Sam

Walk this dog

I've got some old friends on my mind, yeah I do
Yeah, me and Slick and Davy saluting Mr. Daniels
For the very first time
We was jamming to old Jimi, singing Purple Haze, 
No doubt, no, no
I think between weed and whiskey
My head went north and man, my feet went south

We had some good times, 
And man do I remember them well
Those days are long gone, 
But now I got to tell you just how we left some stories to tell

How we were going to be president, one day, baby
How we were going to save the whole world
But man, I got to tell you Lord,
Didn't have a clue back then

We had some good times, 
And man do I remember them well
Those days are long gone, 
But now I got to tell you just how we left some stories to tell

1401,Poison,Ride the Wind,"Hearts of fire
Streets of stone
Modern warriors
Saddle iron horses of chrome

Taste the wild
Lick the wind
Like something they never saw before
Their jaws dropping to the floor
Steel made of soul and sin

Rebels born without a care
(And the day he listens)
Only to fly where eagles dare
And the night she whispers

Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun
(Ride the wind)
(Never coming back again)
Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun

Painted flesh
Loyalty
Humble pride
Just as far as the eye can see

Stories told
Two old friends
Of battle scars and lonely bars
And nights the rain wouldn't end

Here's to withered eyes wearing gypsy smiles
(And the day he listens)
Here's to lovely ladies and a million miles
And the night she whispers

Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun
(Ride the wind)
(Never coming back again)
Ride the wind
I'm still the bravest soul in sin
Burning till the night is done

Of all the truths and lies
And stories of riders in the sky
They say only the bravest try
Where eagles and angels dare to fly

Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun
(Ride the wind)
(Never coming back again)
Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun

Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun
Ride the wind
Never coming back again

Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun"

But nothing's ever as it seems
A mother waves her girl goodbye
Then slowly hangs her head and cries
Hollywood hills and the big city lights
Outside her window they burn bright

They'll know her face they'll shout her name

They'll shout it real loud
She'll make her mama real proud
She'll stand above the crowd

I am someone
Look what I've done
Stare into the sun
I am a shooting star
I am something
I am someone
Look what I've done
I am a shooting star

She looks down at the stars, lying on the streets
Says to herself ""that will be me""
A big time dream, a small town mind
Searching for a break, she may never find
Streets of gold, they turned to grey
Just one more chance, just one more day
Someday that world will know this face
She swears they'll never fall from grace

They'll shout it real loud
She'll make her mama real proud
She'll stand above the crowd
And shout

She stands out on the streets in the pouring rain
Strangers walk by they don't know her name
As the silver screen slowly fades to black
She'll never give in, she can never go back

Someday you'll see me
Don't you need me

I will hold on

And steals the money from my hand
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids,
No regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried forgive me for
What I've done there
'Cause I never meant the things I did""

And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in

Oh, Lord arise
My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve

And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in, oh Lord

Sometimes I wish to God
I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road you gotta take me home

I drive by the homeless sleeping on
A cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read
Jesus Saves
A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win

And give me something to believe in
And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in, oh Lord
And give me something to believe in
And give me something to believe in

You take the high road
And I'll take the low road
And give me something to believe in
And give me something to believe in
Yeah sometimes I wish I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then, yeah
And give me something to believe in, yeah, yeah"

In the heat of the night

Fine floozy sitting pretty
in the city of sin
I'm knocking on your back door

I'll take you down
light your fuse baby
Set your soul on fire
Make your body sweat
soaking wet
In the midnight hour

Step closer my senorita
It's so nice to meet ya
I see your eyes say no
but your flesh is weak

Well sweet salt shaker
and rattle my bones
One more inch I'm gonna drive it home
Hate to see a pretty little woman all alone

She said are you gonna nibble baby
Or are you gonna take yourself a bite
You invite me closer honey
And I just might

I don't want money or a big black car
I just want to know how I'm doing so far
So far I'm gonna do you just right"

When you stand, stand for what you believe

You know you've got to stand
Stand, stand for what you believe
You know you've got to stand
Stand, and I said, stand or what you believe

You know you've got to stand, to stand
Stand for what you believe
So help us to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe

Believers help us stand, yes you do
You know you need to take a stand, well oh yes you do

Yeah, I do
You don't see it coming

Take me down where the sun do shine
Take me back, things be different
You get it, got it, oh, you better get it now

Stay alive, don't let it take you down for the very last time
Stay alive, It don't do you no good looking up from the bottom
Stay alive, don't let it take you down for the very last time

You talk about lies and pain
It don't do you no good with your face in the cocaine

Love, hate, watch that mother
She'll bring you down like no other I've seen
If you know what I mean

Take me back, got to face that demon
Take me down, don't play its fool
Take me back, things be different

1413,Poison,Strange,"I was heading down the highway
She's going my way
She climbed in, the next thing I knew

We started laughing and smoking,
We got to talking
Yeah, we'd both been hurt a time or two

I knew she didn't love me
But I didn't think she'd want me, no
Right there she took me
Underneath that sun, we became one

She said
Life's a little strange
We all need a little strange sometimes
I'm a little strange
A lot like you...
(Let's ride)

Halfway to Boston
She turned down the radio
Asked what I was looking for

Then I looked in her eyes,
For the first time I realized
I really didn't know anymore

Sometimes I think I want true love
Most times I feel like there's no one
But in the meantime hold me tight
Things will be alright

I said...
Life's a little strange
We all need a little strange sometimes
I'm a little strange
A lot like you...
(Let's ride)

I pulled along the highway
The time had come to go our way
She took my hand, looked into my eyes
And said ""won't you hold me one more time""

She said...
Life's a little strange
We all need a little strange sometimes
I'm a little strange a lot
Oh baby, a lot like you..."
1414,Poison,Strike up the Band,"Living off the friends we made
Never ever getting paid
Kicking ass and paying dues
Lose our mind in self abuse

Loving ladies by the score
Waking up and wanting more
I hope my Mama understands
When I strike up the band

Well I spit out my anger as the sweat do fly
Fifteen years of paying dues just to get me by
Now the barkeeps would pay us by the crowds we bring
But those son-of-bitches never paid us one damn thing
And my poor Daddy, he just don't understand
It's balls out tonight, watch the shit hit the fan
When we strike up the band

Now those drop dead ladies line the very first row
I do believe I'd like to spend some time after the show
Now them years gone by, the barkeeps pay in cash
And them lovely ladies feed me an earful of trash

And my old lady, she just don't understand
Why those floozies got their hands on her man
And my poor Daddy, he still don't understand
Why it's balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan
Give it all that we can, we don't give a good damn
When we strike up the band

Living like a gypsy, 
an air conditioned hippie
Who's never seen the light of day
Rode dog and cowboy
Don't know how, boy
I ever lived this long this way, no, no, said

Why it's balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan

So you got dumped
Don't feel ashamed
We got a little something something, gonna ease your pain
So I toke and I snort and I smoke and I sniff
By the way what day is this

You're a natural born loser, don't you understand
That's why you're born to sing in a rock n roll band
Born to feel the pain and write sad songs
With losers like us this is where you belong

Drive big cars and make some green
Wrote a big hit, a number one song

You were my light
When the others wronged me
You did me right

When I look in your eyes
Don't tell me lies
You tell me the truth
Your words, they get me through

This is all I've got
This is all I'd say
If this were my last day

This is my last song
It's all I got
If I bare my soul
Don't you break my heart
Won't you sing along
This is my last song
It's all I got
So don't you break my heart

Wrote down these words
Put them in this song
I play it for you
Pray they don't come out wrong

Cause all I've gots my word
I give it to you
Now it may not be much
It's the best that I can do

This is all I've got
This is all I say
So please don't walk away

This is my last song

Won't you sing along
This is my last song

So don't you break my heart

If this were my last breath
Of my last day
My last chance

Sorry for the tears
Time to say goodbye
I say goodbye
After all these years

You shouldn't have broke my heart"
1419,Poison,The Scream,"A verdict heard by the jury's word...they're lying
I watch as the victims of the slave ships battle with the demons inside

I pray from the ashes of the ruins, the answer will rise

[Chorus]
Hey (the scream)
Hear their screams as they rise from the ashes
Hey
Lord save the soul who can hear the scream

A child is born to a world that is slowly dying
He chooses to march to the beat of a different drum
A man lays dead in the street, his mama is crying
The people, they measure this man by the damage he's done

Lord praise the man who can hear the scream

Forgive us for our sins, I never meant the things I did
I never meant, I never meant, I never meant

1420,Poison,Theatre of the Soul,"On a cold night in a hotel in New Orleans
came the final blow
And somehow somewhere we lost sight 
in our search for that pot of gold

And all that happened I don't understand
Could somebody here, somebody please explain to me
Cause I'm feeling so damn deceived

And I can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately
Theatre of my soul play on child

Ashes to ashes, light the good Lord lays us down
Dust to dust, oh, no
The time has come to lay to rest the years
All the years it took this heart to trust

Maybe too much too soon, I couldn't get my head on straight
All that worry, just wasted time
and now it's much too late to save it

Long forgotten midnight dancer
plays her final role
The curtain falls and I'm still standing
Theatre of my soul you left in vain
Could someone please explain, and I said

I know that nothing's the same
Riding blind on the winds of change
But in my head that scene just keeps on playing

Long forgotten midnight dancer
plays her final role, oh, yes she does
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately
The curtain falls and I'm still standing
In the theatre of my soul
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately
When time it just keeps on passing, 
I got to let it go, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately
I keep searching for those long lost answers
In the theatre of my soul
Theatre of my soul"

Blow my brains out my head
I make the cover of every magazine

I cannot pretend and I will not defend
Why this good old boy's so tragically unhip

Who rock me hard in my world
Its monkey see and monkey do
When I'm?

I got an old waterbed
I like to trip into the dead
I've keep a poster of Kiss on my wall

I still curse, smoke, drink and toke
And make love in the back of my car

Are rolling 

They see strange stalking
Mind stopping
Ass swinging 
Street walking
Floozies

A gypsy on the run

Wishful thinking
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me good!
Wishful thinking yeah yeah
Let's go

Came to Hollywood
Gonna be a big rock star
He can play a million riffs on this here guitar
Now he works two jobs, can't get a break
Takes little white pills to stay awake
No record deals just make him scream
It wasn't like this in his dream

[Chorus]

(come on Bobby)
(Yeah, I like that)

Hollywood
Superstars
Rock n' roll Denny's
Topless bars
Do a porno movie, make some extra cash
But you spend it all too fast
Hollywood just make you scream
It wasn't like this in your dream

[Chorus]

Dream, wishful thinking
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me good
Wishful thinking yeah yeah
Let's go"
1429,Poison,Your Mama Don't Dance,"Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening rolls around and it's time to hit the town
Where do you go
You gotta rock it

The old folks say that you gotta end your date by ten
But if you're out on a date don't you bring her home late 'cause it's a sin
You know there's no excuse, you know you're gonna lose, you never win
I'll say it again

And it's all because

Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening rolls around and it's time to hit the town
Where do you go
You gotta rock it, rock it

You see I pulled into a drive-in and I found a place to park
We hopped into the backseat where it's always nice and dark
We're just about to move thinkin' umm, Bret, this is a breeze
There's a light in my eye and a guy says, out of the car, long hair

Oowee, you're coming with me
Said the local police

And it's all because

Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening comes around and it's time to hit the town
Where do you go

Ah, play me a little C.C., woo

Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
They just ain't cool and it ain't about the style
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance, no
She just don't dance, no
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Ah, yeah"

I saw you

Our conversation's just begun
Maybe we can talk more after school

You'd like to let me
Go out with you

I got your number from a friend
So I called
To talk to you
I don't live too far
We could walk down to the park
If you got nothing else to do
Being that you're new in town
You probably want to look around
But I could tell you, before you do
Cause you really mean a lot to me
And you don't have to look no more
Cause I've found the girl I'm looking for

I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
It's only you, yeah

If I could have any girl in school
I wouldn't take but one
The only girl I want is you

If I could do anything
Anything I wanted to
It wouldn't be too hard to choose

1436,Queensrÿche,Almost Cut My Hair,"Almost cut my hair
It happened just the other day
It's gettin' kind of long
I could've said it was in my way

But I didn't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
And I feel like I owe it to someone

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I'm not feeling up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car

Well, I'm not giving in an inch to fear
'Cause I've promised myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone

When I finally get myself together
I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather

And I'm goin' to find a space inside to laugh
Separate the wheat from the chaff
I feel like I owe it to someone, yeah"
1437,Queensrÿche,Anarchy X,"Weeks ago in Occidental Park
Hundreds of people gathered
For a political rally
There was a man shouting
Above all the others

""Do we have freedom?
Do we have equality?
This country's changing!
It is no longer for all of the people!
It is for some of the people!""
The man's name? ""Dr. X."""
1438,Queensrÿche,Another Rainy Night,"Don't slam the door, on your way out
Don't leave without saying goodbye
Another long distance night alone
You leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more
Last word today, coming home to stay?
Wouldn't that be nice, for a while?

But now my take-out food is growing cold
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone

I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you
Guess I'll leave a light on for you
It's just another rainy night, without you

Listen, there's a foghorn blowing
From the coast tonight
Remember making love in the rain?
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain
I'm not much without you, can't leave
If I wanted to. maybe that's why you stay around

But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called

I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you
Waiting by the phone, alone
It's just another rainy night, without you
Guess I'll leave a light on for you

I know I've said it before
Hate the sound of the closing door
And your footsteps walking away

But now my take-out food is growing cold
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone
I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you
Waiting by the phone, alone
And it's another rainy night, without you
Guess I'll leave a light on for you

It's just another rainy night, another rainy night
Another rainy night without you"
1439,Queensrÿche,Anybody Listening?,"You and I long to live like wind upon the water
If we close our eyes we'll maybe realize
There's more to life than what we have known
And I can't believe I've spent so long
Living lies I knew were wrong inside
I've just begun to see the light

Long ago there was a dream, had to make a choice or two
Leaving all I loved behind for what nobody knew
Stepped out on the stage
A life under lights and judging eyes
Now the applause has died and I can dream again
Is there anybody listening?
Is there anyone that sees what's going on?
Read between the lines, criticize the words they're selling
Think for yourself and feel the walls
Become sand beneath your feet

Fell the breeze?
Time's so near you can almost taste the freedom
There's a warm wind from the south
Hoist the sail and we'll be gone
By morning, this will all seem like a dream
And if I don't return to sing the song, maybe just as well
I've seen the news and there's not much I can do alone

Is there anybody listening?
Is there anyone who smiles without a mask?
What's behind the words images
They know will please us?
I'll take what's real
Bring up the lights

Is there anybody listening?
Is there anyone that sees what's going one?
Read between the lines
Criticize the words they're selling
Think for yourself and feel the walls
Become sand beneath your feet

Close your eyes"
1440,Queensrÿche,Around the World,"Maybe what we need
Is just space to breath, yeah
Maybe we just need to
Take a step back
And think this through

So necessary
While others found it challenging
There's so many ways we can change
So many ways to see
Someone else's point of view

All around the world
Can you see a day everyone meaning the same way
All you need is love
We're blinded by fear
And we hate a brother we don't understand
His differences is, is our ignorance
That's a handicap waiting for a cure

All around the world
We act the same way when 
you're love is like a flock 
All you need is love
All around the world
Love changes everything 
even is the smallest of ways (hmm)
All you need is love

Day by day the vale is lifted
I release control
All these changes, all this rearranging
Starts with me
If I want more

Ah
All we need
All we need
You know
All we need is love

All around the world
People have a choice to speak in fear
Only love voice
All you need is love
Love is all you need
What is wrong with me
All around the world
Change begins with you
With everything you do

All around the world
All you need is love love
It's time to stop the pain
Time to stop the pain

All around the world
All you need is love 
All you need is love 
All you need is love 
All you need is love 
All you need is love 
All you need is love"
1441,Queensrÿche,At the Edge,"Yeah, you can smell it in air
Frustration, you know, like no one cares
We've forgotten how to dream
When they come scraping through the wreckage 
And leave it all for saints to sanctify
You'll be dancing at the edge of the world

Now read the headlines, what a sleeper
Now I ain't Gandhi and I ain't no teacher
But it's all the rage with my generation, 
I'm doped up fat, can't get it up
Gimmie another shot I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Some one's kicking in your door and you're screaming for the more
Dancing at the edge, yeah you're just going to take it?
Ain't going to make me bow my head, dancing at the edge

Time to listen, cards close
Time to look at what's behind closed doors
Got gasoline, ammunition, like 911, a controlled demolition
""Come to Jesus"", they say, ""Don't be a sinner""
They chose a mad man to be our leader
Now where's the rage, my generation, doped up fat
Can't get it up, gimmie another shot, I'll be fine

Campaign promises, no one's buying it
How much can you take before your back breaks?
Now where's your rage?
My generation, doped up fat, can't get it up
Gimmie another shot, gimmie another shot"
1442,Queensrÿche,Best I Can,"Don't worry, dear he'll never find the gun

A child alone in daddy's room
The gun was hidden here
No one home to catch me when I fall

A young man now in a private chair
I've seen the world through a bitter stare
But my dream is still alive
I'm going to be the best I can

I want to be a busy man
I want to see a change in the future
I'm gonna make the best of what I have
I want to write for a magazine
I'm gonna be the best they've ever seen
I know I'll win if I give it all I can

I won't let go
Gotta make the grade, no I won't let go
To be the best man, the best man that I can

Back street hoop star you've got it good
You were the wonder of the crumbling neighborhood
Now taking bids on the next six digit plan
Showed me that my will survived
The tragedy that came into my life
Giving me hope and the new start that I have

And I won't let go
Gotta make the grae no, I won't let go
To be the best man, the best man that I can

Step by step I dream the plan
From my chair to walking man
This constant dream is on my mind
Chase the light I see ahead
Luminate the path I tread
I live to be the best I can

Now I'm moving forward and I'm never looking back
Straight ahead, focused on the big attack
On a roll and I'm never slowing down
I won't be torn between
The man in the chair and the man that's in my dream
I'm going to melt the two men into one

And I won't let go
Gotta make the grade I set no, I won't let it go
To be the best man,
The best man that I can 
The best man that I can 
The best man that I can"
1443,Queensrÿche,Big Noize,"When I'm looking up, you're looking down
Always on the outside no common ground
I don't get what you think you're trying to be

You know, everything you say is such a bore
I'm just trying to hold on
The paper in front of me is screaming 
But you can't see how we're dying

Give me blue girls, give it to me now
Hat will it take to convince us to change?
A hard rain gonna come, a hard rain is going to fall
It's going to make Big Noize
It's gonna make Big Noize, change your mind

That day in September when our pants were down
I'll never forget the buildings falling round us
They always said it couldn't happen here
Now we're coming apart from the inside and we're mad as hell
But all the fun is about to begin so you better jump in, hold on

Because we're tired of your game, rules you make
Political views the money you take, golden tans, velvet ropes
No more snow white smiles
I wish it would rain

A hard rain's gonna come with televised opinions
So everyone can look at what's inside
But all it takes is a moment and you're free
Are you ready for that?

A hard rain gonna come. Make Big Noize
It's gonna change the world. Make Big Noize
It's just got to change, change your mind"
1444,Queensrÿche,Blinded,"From the night comes a roar of thunder
Beholding light on the spell you're under
And the signs of death descend your way
Fighting back from the devil's hunger
Freeing souls from their chosen number
And the sword of right will guide your way

And thus you'll find that only demons fill your mind until you wake
But only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from today

Burning dreams cause your mind to wonder
Iron crosses are the calling numbers
And the fight for the answer still remains old

But the night will reflect the hunger
And the blackness will pull you under
Still the sword of right will guide your way

And in the night you'll hear the voices calling down and they will stay
But only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from today.

1445,Queensrÿche,Breakdown,"When the whirlwind of noise surrounds and get intense,
and when words can¡¯t hide their anger or intent. 
I feel it in my bones and in my head, can¡¯t make sense of what is said.

Ready for the take down, headed for a breakdown.
Fear has me backed against these walls that I follow and pace.
Time moves in and out of phase of everything that I face.
I feel it in my bones they rattle and shake, can¡¯t find a trace of what it takes to stop this take down.
Can¡¯t stop this breakdown!
Welcome to my scene. A place that¡¯s in-between where squares fit the round.
Some affectionately call it ... my breakdown....

When I feel the pressure mounting and my hands begin to clutch, I reach my limit of pain and I¡¯ve had enough.
It feels good to pound on tables and chairs and feel the frenzy start to wear.
Breakdown this take down, gotta stop this breakdown.
Welcome to my scene. A place that¡¯s in-between where squares fit the round.
It¡¯ll never be, never be more than this. Never.

1446,Queensrÿche,Breaking the Silence,"They told me to run, but just how far?
Can I go wearing the black mask of fear?
The hate in my eyes always gives me away
The tension building slowly
Now I lost everything I had in you
Nothing we shared means a thing
Without you close to me
I can't live without you

Breaking the silence of the night
Can't you hear me screaming?
I look for your face in the neon light
You never answer me

There's no direction to my stare
No more flame burning in my heart anymore
Quiet, I keep it to myself
Until the sun sets slowly
I hear your voice in the evening rain calling
Nothing will keep us apart
No more lies and fear
There's no end to our story

Breaking the silence of the night
Can't you hear me screaming?
I look for your face in the neon light
You never answer
I could make all the wrong seem right
If you were by my side
I'd gather all the tears you cried
And hide them deep underground

Can't look back, it's just a waste of time
Can't erase this hate from my eyes

Breaking the silence of the night
Through the streets I'm screaming
Looking for you in the neon light
Why don't you answer me?
Breaking the silence with my cries
Can't you hear me screaming?
We could make all this wrong seem right
But you never answer me"
1447,Queensrÿche,Bridge,"You called me up on the phone today
Struggling with the right words to say.
Time can change a thing or two.
Time has changed the lives of me and you,
But you know it could have been different dad.

The word brings back a sweet memory.
I'm sitting on a bluff on a broken tree,
By my side a distinguished man
Giving me encouragement, telling me I can,
And you know you're not there.

You say, ""Son, let's forget the past,
I want another chance, gonna make it last.""
You're begging me for a brand new start,
Trying to mend a bridge that's been blown apart,
But you know you never built it dad.

So I sit here through the night,
And I write myself to sleep,
And time keeps ticking

Time has made you finally realize
Your loneliness and your guilt inside.
You're reaching for something you never had,
Turning around now you're looking back,
And you know I'm not there.

You say, ""Son, let's forget the past.
I want another chance, gonna make it last.""
You're begging me for a brand new start,
Trying to mend a bridge that's been blown apart,
But you know you never built it dad."
1448,Queensrÿche,Broken,"You're broken
Broken like a promise 
Can you remember sunny days 
And the smiling face of love?
My love, do you remember me?
Hush now, hush now
Silly girl don't cry
Just put your hand in mine
I remember
The way you laughed and how we danced 
All night

Wish I could have died in your arms
Hush now, hush now it's almost time
There's no more pain 
No fear, put your hand in mine
All your wishes
All those kisses are here waiting for you
Come to me"
1449,Queensrÿche,Bullet the Blue Sky,"In the howling wind comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly, a red orange glow
See the face of fear
Running scared in the valley below

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses
See the flames higher and higher

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

This guy comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colors of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slapping them down
One hundred, two hundred
And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
You take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside is America
Outside is America

Across the field you see the sky ripped open
See the rain through a gaping wound
Pounding on the women and children
Who run
Into the arms
Of America"
1450,Queensrÿche,Burning Man,"The rise and fall of my sloppy love, The smatterings, and splatterings, 
They'll get you. 
I'm not the one you were thinking of, 
Maybe you thought I'd call, Instead of crashing down your hall. 
Hold me down, but I'll find out. 
You know you will never get what you need, 
Blue Diamond strike 'em anywhere, 
First we caffeinate, then incinerate, 
We'll get you. 
And sparks will fly in the summer air, 
Did you pull out of your stall, 
Maybe I'll see you after all. 
Say we don't. Know who we are. We say no, 
I live my life like the burning man, 
Like a burning man, 
Like a burning man, 
And I won't get enough 'Till my legs are broken, 
The stars they shine. In an empty void. 
Life is not to fear, life is to enjoy, 
He'll get you. 
Mr. Death catches all someday. 
Baby I thought you'd call. 
Or leave a light on in the hall, 
Hold me down, But I'll find out. We say no, 
I live my life like a burning man, 
And I won't get enough,

1451,Queensrÿche,Damaged,"Waiting for the feeling to subside,
Paranoid, I melt into myself.
They say I'm to reach inside and find
the broken part of my machinery.
Psychoanalyze the chapters
on the path to my darkest day.
Searching for the answers,
all I see is damage through the haze.
Picking up the pieces of my life
with no direction for re-assembly.
The one that lays beside me
is sharing scars of my broken yesterdays.
Will tomorrow find me hypnotized? Crying?
Mother Mary in control,
domineering stranglehold
sowing destructive seeds
for the scavengers to feed.
Driving the nail into my head,
memory flows like a river.
With the one that lays beside me
I'm healing scars from my childhood memories.
Tomorrow finally found me.
I'm hypnotized. I'm trying...
to understand the chapters
of the path from my darkest day.
Searching for the answers
but there's DAMAGE!

Sad people make you glad
Pardon me, could you spare some change
Oh, you're still crying

Street corner girl
Watch the crowd go by
Fill your tin can with life
Summer days tend to slip away
Like your men you couldn't make them stay
Hard to choose, whiskey or a wife
Sometimes you wonder where's the end
Where you goin' where you been?
Happiness seems so hard to win
Most never care to find

I see something that reminds me of you
Every night the dreams return to haunt me
Your rosary wrapped around your throat
I lie awake and sweat, afraid to fall asleep
I see your face looking back at me, looking back at me

And I raise my head and stare
Into the eyes of a stranger
I've always known that the mirror never lies
People always turn away
From the eyes of a stranger
Afraid to know what
Lies behind the stare

Is this all that's left
Of my life before me
Straight jacket memories, sedative highs
No happy ending like they've always promised
There's got to be something left for me

How many more lies will they tell me

Jesus, You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good You've done
Will soon be swept away
You begun to matter more
Than the things You say

Listen, Jesus I don't like what I see
All I ask is that You listen to me
And remember, I've been Your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt You when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called You a man
And believe me, my admiration for You hasn't died
But every word You say today, is twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt You if they think You've lied

Nazareth's your famous Son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like His father carving wood
He'd have made good, tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm no one alarm

Listen Jesus, do You care for Your race?
Don't You see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied, have You forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd for we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far, if we go too far

Listen, Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour

All Your followers are blind, too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful but now it's sour, yes it's all gone sour
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

I won't be there to see you dance and hear
You sing the songs we love.

I'm home again.

You know you make me proud
Because you're the one that I depend upon.
And when I return, I promise,
I'll never leave you alone again.
It's harder than I thought and you're so far away.

Said goodbye.

Because Daddy's brave and he's coming
Home. But if I could change one thing,
I'd never let you go.

I want you here to see me dance and sing
Along to the songs we love.
So I'll be strong. It won't be long till you're
Home again with me.

I want you to know that I'm thinking about
You, making plans for when I'm home.
Why aren't you here?

I wake up every night.
I check the front porch light,
Making sure it's shining bright.
And I'll be there to shine the light
So you can find your way to me.
I'm feeling strong, but don't take too long.
Please come home to me.
I'll be there to see you dance and hear you
Sing the songs I love.

It won't be long.

An indispensable satellite tool I abuse, I abuse.
The world wide web and all the pictures on YouTube, there's no escaping it.
Keeps on crawling under my skin.

Can't look away from the screen, might miss what's happening.
I'm busy surfing for some other kind of fantasy.
My mind's a river flowing don't know which way to run.
I'm wound up tight I'm like a hot spot junkie with a down loaded gun.

This Wifi frenzy world revolutionary cyber world.
Ready get some air time, air wave time.
You got it under your skin?

The world wide web has the local news on YouTube.
The connectivity is crossing the threshold, crossing the threshold.

1472,Queensrÿche,I Don't Believe in Love,"I awoke on impact
Under surveillance from the camera eye
Searching high and low
The criminal mind found at the scene of the crime
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it
She said she loved me
I guess I never knew
But do we ever, ever really know?
She said she'd meet me on the other side
But I knew right then, I'd never find her

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No more nightmares, I've seen them all
From the day I was born
They've haunted my every move
Every open hand's there to push and shove
No time for love it doesn't matter
She made a difference
I guess she had a way
Of making every night seem bright as day
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I need to forget her face, I see it still
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No chance for contact
There's no raison d'etre
My only hope is one day I'll forget
The pain of knowing what can never be
With or without love it's all the same to me

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real

Can you hear me?

A fool is left to live as the brave ones fall.
I swear if I were able,
I would have done the same for you.
But now you're gone and I wish I were too.

I spend all my time asking questions,
How can I pay you back when
The price you paid was so high, my friends.
If I were King of all I imagine,
I would trade all I am
To have you by my side.

If I were King.
I have too much time today, my brother.
Can you hear me?

I know where I am, but I still feel lost.
Please know that I am grateful
For the years you gave to me.
Everything's changed, but nothing changes
For you.

I won't waste my life asking questions.
I've seen the horror of war and
There's so much more for a man who's been
Where I've been.

If I were King of all I imagine,

While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain

Oh yes, we'll keep on tryin'
Tread that fine line
Oh we'll, keep on tryin', yeah
Just passing our time

While we live according to race, color or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons and on and on

Oh yes, we'll keep on tryin'
We'll tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on tryin'
Till the end of time, till the end of time

Through the sorrow all through our splendor
Don't take offense at my innuendo

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything
You think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego, be free, be free to yourself

Ooh, ooh
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears, release your mask

Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah
And whatever will be, will be

We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying

Waited so long I can't wait another day without you

Jet city woman
It's a long way, home to my
Jet city woman
I see her face everywhere, can't get her out of my mind

Whenever I'm alone I'm thinking
There's a part missing from my life
Wonder where I'd be without your love
Holding me together now I'm
Watching the time tick, tick away
Face grows longer every day
Fortunes are lost on the women I've seen
But without you I can't breathe, you're the air to me!
Waited so long I can't wait another day without you?

Jet city woman got to find my way home to her
Jet city woman I see her face everywhere I look!
Jet city woman just a thousand miles and I'll be there
Jet city woman, to make the clouds go away
Time for some blue sky!

Waited so long now the plane's delayed an hour
Reminds me of all our days apart 
Hold on, just a little longer

Lady Jane your eyes are wide today,

It's quite a scary, scary ride we take, Lady Jane.

Yesterday seemed very dark, but now it's bright,

Another day, another nightmare begins.
And the sound that I hear
Is the relentless firing in my head.

Shifting gear in the driver's seat as
The finger of God signals me
And this concrete bloodline carries me.
Never thought I'd bring the war back home.

I'm a number, I'm a casualty of war
For a cause I never had the chance,
Didn't understand the score.
They told me that I'd be okay,
Assume civilian life, live day to day.
But when I think about it my hands still shake,
And I know what I am
Man Down!

I'm in overdrive, barely alive!
As long as I keep moving, I'm all right.
Was that a muzzle flash from my past
Or just my mind misfiring?

With one eye in mirror I see
The ""Cavalry of God"" coming up on me.
Bumper to bumper, traveling fast,
Waving Satan over

I'm a number, I'm a casualty of war,
For a cause I never had the chance,
Never understood the score.
They told me that I'd be okay,
Assume civilian life, live day to day.

I'll be all right.
All right.

Laser light shines bright behind me.
Can't see what's ahead or beside me.
Everyone here has a gun.

No mistakes, not like last time.
You don't want to be on the wrong side of Hell.
I'm all right.

To whatever is left of me.

Crawling on my hands and knees.

Can't feel a thing.

I don't really understand what happened.

That won't make it out alive but

My global mind reaches out for the truth.
Why try holding back the wave?
You'll only drown in the changes.
You've got to learn to let go.
Just let go and experience the flight.
Try to see from a different side..
If balance is the key
Maybe we'll see
A future understanding,

Then we won't feel so helpless,
An turn away and hide from the change.

My global mind searches for something new.
My global mind zeros in on news.

Time and rules are changing.
Attention span is quickening.
Welcome to the Information Age.

Across every man made line.

Known to all who hear the sound
The call of morning rising
You're in a mystic space

As it names you

Oh, can't you see the lies in front of you
Your journey ends so far, and still the distance
Spins round and round you
Now you cry - give me sanctuary
You scream but no one listens
Again you cry - give me sanctuary
Until the end I'll fight and die, to be free
Oh! No sanctuary

You're walking halfway in
But crawling halfway out
There's a void in your mind that you cling to
You feel lost in time, you've got no words to rhyme
No more charms, no more spells to protect you

Oh can't you see the lies in front of you
Your journey ends so far, and still the distance
Spins round and round you

You scream, but no one listens
Again you cry - give me sanctuary
Until the end I'll fight and die
Oh I've got to be free

Never wondering why when nothing's heard, one prayer.

A woman cries in frustration, her man holds it inside.
They forgot what got them here, 
The vows they promised to stand by, one love.

One life is like one prayer, one love to share.
One thought, one dream. 
One world, one meaning.

It don't cost much for you to get to heaven, 
You just got to say your prayers.

Heed the cries of the war child. 
Mothers hold them to their breasts.

No one enters

the barrier only I embrace.
Time is fleeing now they say,
Take time to look inside and face, the change.

Dig down deep
to find the man I thought I was.
A dog on a treadmill panting,
the master pulls the leash, laughing.
Now I can't remember why
I needed to run, needed to try so hard.

One more time around
is all I ask for now,
a star to seek by, wind to
take me home again.

""Work hard in life boy,
there's paradise in the end.""
Year after year we struggle to gain
the happiness our parents never claimed.
They told us all we had to do

Old man is strapped to the seat of his chair, wearing a gown.

My ring of brass lay rusting on the floor.
Is this all?
Because it's not what I expected.

Somewhere along the way
Friends I once held close fled the fast lane.
I didn't notice, I just had to make it.
Head down, nose in the grindstone;
The kiss of life placed on my brow
Kept sliddin' to the ground
And now it's buried six feet under.

Preaching from the floor again
The same old sad song,
""Bartender, bring another drink for their favorite son.""

Where did it all go wrong?
What's the use in even holding on?
Here's to love, hate, and promises.

Almost called it today.
Turned to face ""The Void""
Numb with the suffering
And the question,
""Why am I?""
So many times I've tried and failed to
Gather my courage, reach again for that nail.
Life's been like
Dragging feet through sand,
And never finding, 
Promised land.

Preaching from the floor again
The same old sad song,
""Bartender, bring another drink for their favorite song.""

To promises and promised land lies."

Course of rage, a never ending fight for the unknown

Well, I'm tired of all this bullshit
They keep selling me on T.V.
About the communist plan
And all the shady preachers
Begging for my cash
Swiss bank accounts while giving their secretaries the slam

They're all in Penthouse now
Or Playboy magazine, million dollar stories to tell
I guess Warhol wasn't wrong
Fame fifteen minutes long
Everyone's using everybody, making the sale

I used to think
That only America's way, way was right
But now the holy dollar rules everybody's lives
Gotta make a million, doesn't matter who dies

1493,Queensrÿche,Scarborough Fair,"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, 
Remember me to the one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine.

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, 
Without a seem or needlework 
She once was a true love of mine.

Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
And gather it all with a basket of flowers
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

Ask her to buy me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
Between some water and the stand
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?

1494,Queensrÿche,Sign of the Times,"Heading for the classroom yesterday
The kids file through the metal machine
It finds what they may hide
No it just ain't right
A sign of the times

Another church is burning to the ground
Looking for the vandals and they're nowhere to be found
But the hate's alive
A sign of the times, Sign of the times 
A sign of the times, Sign of the times 

Would someone please let me know how we have spun out of control?
Has the captain let go of the wheel?
Or could we please try to find a way to be a bit more kind?
I see the road to tomorrow in the haze!

On the Senate floor they congregate
Many pockets lined with green,
From those behind the scenes, yeah they take the bribe (it's on the side)
A sign of the times, Sign of the times 
A sign of the times, Sign of the times"
1495,Queensrÿche,Silent Lucidity,"Hush now don't cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over
Or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run to in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize it and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly, you hear and see
This magic new dimension

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you, in silent lucidity

Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Dream control
Dream control (hug me)
Dream control
Hug me

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you"
1496,Queensrÿche,Sliver,"It's time to sack up and let go of your mothers.
Take your gun, it's the cross that's carried by your brothers.
A sliver is all there is, a sliver of the old you.
Underneath the skin, buried deep,
there's a man. There's a soldier in you.

What you doing here?
Welcome to the show!

There's only one man you can trust, he's the one at your side.
This shit's for real, there's nowhere to hide.
They say that conflict makes the man.
He survives with what he can.
The brave of heart won't look away
but live to fight another day.

What you doing here?
Welcome to the show!"
1497,Queensrÿche,Someone Else?,"When I fell from grace
I never realized
How deep the flood was around me.
A man whose life was toil
Was like a kettle left to boil,
And the water left scars on me.

I know now who I am.
If only for a while,
I recognize the changes.
I feel like I did before the
Magic wore thin and the ""baptism
Of stains"" began.

They used to say I was
Nowhere, man,
Heading down
Was my destiny.
But yesterday, I swear,
That was someone else not me.

Here I stand at the crossroads edge,
Afraid to reach out for eternity,
One step, when I look down,
I see someone else not me.

Looking back and I see
Someone else.

All my life they said I
Was going down,
But I'm still standing,
Stronger, proud.
And today I know there's
So much more I can be.

From where I stand at the crossroads edge,
There's a path leading out to sea.
And from somewhere
Deep in my mind,
Sirens sing out loud
Songs of doubt
As only they know how.
But one glance back reminds, and I see,
Someone else not me.

I keep looking back
At someone else, me?"
1498,Queensrÿche,Speak,"They've given me a mission
Don't really know the game, yeah
I'm bent on submission
Religion is to blame
I'm the new messiah
Death Angel with a gun
Dangerous in my silence
Deadly to my cause

Speak to me the pain you feel
Speak the word
The word is all of us

I've given my life to become what I am
To preach the new beginning
To make you understand
To reach some point of order
Utopia in mind, you've got to learn
To sacrifice, to leave what's now behind

Speak to me the pain you feel
Speak the word
The word is all of us
Speak the word
The word is all of us

Seven years of power
The corporation claw
The rich control the government, the media the law
To make some kind of difference
Then everyone must know
Eradicate the fascists, revolution will grow

The system we learn says we're equal under law
But the streets are reality, the weak and poor will fall
Let's tip the power balance and tear down their crown
Educate the masses, we'll burn the White House down

Speak to me the pain you feel
Speak to me the pain you feel
Speak the word (revolution)
The word is all of us
Speak the word (revolution)
The word is all of us
Speak the word
The word is all of us
Speak the Word
The word is all of us

Speak!"
1499,Queensrÿche,Spreading the Disease,"She always brings me what I need
Without I beg and sweat and bleed
When we're alone at night
Waiting for the call
She feeds my skin

Sixteen and on the run from home
Found a job in Times Square
Working live S&M shows
Twenty-five bucks a fuck
And John's a happy man
She wipes the filth away
And it's back on the streets again

Spreading the disease
Everybody needs
But no one wants to see

Father William saved her from the streets
She drank the lifeblood from the saviour's feet
She's Sister Mary now, eyes as cold as ice
He takes her once a week
On the alter like a sacrifice

Spreading the disease
Everybody needs
But no one wants to see

Religion and sex are powerplays
Manipulate the people for the money they pay
Selling skin, selling God
The numbers look the same on their credit cards
Politicians say no to drugs
While we can pay for wars in South America

Fighting fire with empty words
While the banks get fat
And the poor stay poor
And the rich get rich
And the cops get paid
To look away
As the one percent rules America

Spreading the disease
Everybody needs
But no one wants to see
The way society
Keeps spreading the disease"
1500,Queensrÿche,Suite Sister Mary,"""Kill her. That's all you have to do""
""Kill Mary?""
""She's a risk, and get the priest as well""

Ten P.M., I feel the rain coming down
My face feels the wet, my mind the storm
Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour
Moving silent, through the streets, they're mine, they're mine

Midnight, she sings praises in the Hall
To saintly faces hallowed be their names she can't recall
Sister Mary, virgin Mary, silent with her sin
(""What are you doing out in the rain?"")
She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks
(""I've been waiting for you, come in"")

Mary, Mary just a whore for the underground
(They made you pay in guilt for your salvation)
Thought you had them fooled? Now they've sent me for you
You know too much for your own good
Don't offer me faith, I've got all I need here
(My faith is growing, growing tight against the seam)
What we need is trust, to keep us both alive
Help us make it through the night

I've no more want of any faith
Binds my arm and feed my mind
The only peace I've ever known
I'll close my eyes and you shoot

No Mary, listen, you've got to pull your strength 
(From my lips, I pray I feed you well)
Your precious cross is gone, it made me wait so long
For what you gave to everyone
The priest is cold and dead on his knees he fed
(From my barrel of death, he turned)
The Holy water red, as he died he said ""thank you""
I just watched him bleed

I feel the flow, the blessed stain
Sweating hands like fire, and flames
Burn my thighs, spread in sacrificial right
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight

Mary, my lady of pain
Always alone
Blind you search for the truth
I see myself in you, parallel lives
Winding at light-speed through time

No time to rest yet
We've got to stop his game
(Before madness has the final laugh)
Too much bloodshed
We're being used and fed
Like rats in experiments
There's no final outcome here
Only pain and fear
(It's followed us both all our lives)
There's one thing left to see
Will it be him or me?
There's one more candle left to light

Don't turn your back on my disgrace
The blood of Christ can't heal my wounds, so deep
The sins of man are all I taste
Can't spit the memory from my mind
I can't cry anymore

Mary, my lady of pain, always alone
Blind you search for the truth
I see myself in you, parallel lives
Winding at light-speed through time, you're mine"
1501,Queensrÿche,Synchronicity II,"Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Crispies
We can't hear anything at all
Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why
The secretaries pout and preen like
Cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake
Many miles away, many miles away"
1502,Queensrÿche,The Chase,"You think you're smart, inventive
Because you've figured out my game?
Pride is a handy substitute
When you've got only yourself to blame

All my dreams I've realized while you were indisposed
While you've spent eighteen years watching TV
I've watched my fortune grow

Here I am I'm finally on the outside and
You're nowhere near where I've been
I've got you where I want you at last
You've got no idea who I am

We circle around each other waiting for reaction
We circle around each other waiting for reaction
Wanting satisfaction for the past
I want nothing from the past

Always been so easy you're like a puppet on my string
Throwing down hollow threats, unsure of what to think
Why should I care? You wouldn't dare
You're nothing but worthless I swear

From where I stand I've got you where I want you
You'll never take me! Never take me down
I've seen all I need to put you in the ground
Revenge is normal, a typical reaction

I've seen your cynical reaction
If you're standing outside of in
Always on the outside of in

Here we are at last facing oblivion
And this is where finally it ends
You don't belong here
Holding fast to each of our sins

With hope by my side, I'll survive to see the dawn
Believe me or not you owe me, I owe you nothing
I gave your life a purpose
I owe you nothing but your death
Without me you wouldn't have learned a thing

1503,Queensrÿche,The Killer,"Mother hides her face.
She drops to her knees,
Her sacrifice complete.
The last of her line.
What's left of her name?
Nothing will ever be the same.

I'm not sorry for what I had to do.
It must be done.
You know G'd rewards the winner.
Now I'm on my knees again,
Give me strength to win.
If I stop to listen,
I hear ""Voices"" in the wind.

""Shoot him!"" They say,
Who will be the killer?
Who will be the winner?
""Shoot him!""
Who will be the killer?
Can't give in!

You know you can't begin to
Imagine where I've been,
Until you've walked a while in my shoes.
Surrounded and outnumbered.
Children wearing bombs?
I'm crying.

Oh, now I can't stop to sympathize.
Would you trade your eyes for mine?
I'll give you more time to answer.
I'll give you some time to rethink.
But there's never time when
The bullets are flying.

You duck your head and hit the ground!
""Shoot him""! Yeah!
Who will be the killer?
Who will be the winner?
""Shoot him!"" Yeah,
I've got to be the killer!
I've got to LIVE!

When you feel it.

Open your eyes so you can see it.
Don't try to think just believe it.
Then you'll know you're not dreaming!

Who will be the killer?

1504,Queensrÿche,The Mission,"In the wooden chair
Beside my window
I wear a face born in the falling rain
I talk to shadows from a lonely candle
Recite the phrases from the wall
I can't explain this Holy pain

Six days ago my life had taken a tumble
The orders came from high above they say
A need to use me once again they've got my number
Further the cause boy, yes you know the game

I'll wait here for days longer
Till the sister comes to wash my sins away
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow
She brings the only friend
That helps me find my way

I search the past back to a time
When I was younger
A target for the new society
Picked to displace the leaders
Countering objectives
Of this new underground reality

Waiting for days longer
TilL sister comes to wash my sins away
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow
My love for her
Will help me find my way

My mission saved the world
And I stood proud
My mission changed the world
It turned my life around

I look around my room is filled with candles
Each one a story but they end the same
I'll hide away in here the law will never find me
The walls will tell the story of my pain

Waiting for days longer
Till sister comes to wash my sins away
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow
She sets the pace for my delivery of pain

My mission saved the world
And I stood proud
My mission changed the world

Save this world, we'll all stand proud
Our mission changed the world, we'll change the world
We'll all stand proud"
1505,Queensrÿche,The Needle Lies,"""I've had enough and I want out!""
""You can't walk away now"" 

I looked back once
And all I saw was his face
Smiling, the needle crying
Walking out of his room
With mirrors, afraid I heard him scream
You'll never get away

Cold and shaking
I crawled down alleys to try
And scrape away the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall

(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name

Wet and raving
The needle keeps calling me back
To bloody my hands forever
Carved my cure with the blade
That left me in scars
Now every time I'm weak
Words scream from my arm

(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name
(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
(Don't ever trust)
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name"
1506,Queensrÿche,The Thin Line,"Another hungry look in her eyes again
Pacing the floor
The hunt begins
Skin-tight leather provides my pleasure
Wake my fear, surge wit the pressure
Walk away and leave forever, do I dare?

Raise my eyes, she stands
Holding out healing hands 
Are you happy now?

I walk the thin line for you
Do just what you say to
With fear as my friend
I walk the thin line one more time for you

Addictive face pretending, don't speak the word
Forbidden sin relenting, I barely heard
Screams of entry blur my vision
Wake my fear of divine intervention
Crawl away and bleed forever, if you dare

Hand on mouth the game goes on
Love, our stage to play upon
Are you happy now?

I walk the thin line for you
Do just what you say to
With fear as my friend
I walk the thin line one more time for you

I walk the thin line for you

I walk the thin line one more time for you"
1507,Queensrÿche,Tribe,"Taken to a place underground,
A cavern, ten thousand steps down
The only light was fire fly glow,
Reflecting in the blue crystal show
Feeling in the darkness surrounding me,
Roots of giant Sequoia trees
Anchor the canopy of life that's above
The answer to the mystery of life is

Traveled through the jungles of the Yucatan
And drank the potion from the magic man
Held the starlight inches from my face,
Pushed the door open, # 7.
I walked the path way to heaven
Saw the same face of God.

[Chorus]
Seems every where I go
I see the same face, I feel the same flow.
With every one I meet and every hand I shake,
I'm every man, trying my best to get to know
Because everything's at stake

[Verse]
We're the same tribe.
Passing through Morocco for the faithful is a trip
Hallucinating visions drives my desert ship
For a thousand miles we could not fail,
Can't enjoy if you can't inhale
Clearly a lifetimes need of some experience and
For the record, peace

[Chorus]
Seems every where I go
I see the same face, I feel the same flow

1509,Queensrÿche,Warning,"I remember I was asking why
And someday you said I'd know
All these years, of fighting hard
And now it's finally come too close

I can't believe it's now happening to me
Oh, couldn't it wait a few hundred years
Destiny can't rest you see, now it's time
Time to cry your tears! Now cry!

The child of centuries, forgotten in time
You talk in circles of rhyme
Seer of places future and past
The warning you gave us is surely our last

Warning!
Behold the child, his pointing hand
Is raised in solemn grace
His eyes once wide with learning wonder
Now leave stains upon his face

Now see the hands of the working man
He's leaning back against the wall
Once busy hands are idle now
Standing ready for the fall! Our fall!

The signs will come as days past by
For those that claim to see
The blind will stay not choosing to die
Not believing the visions I've seen

Warning!"

Provided with toys and Scouting for Boys
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
And you didn't like school
You know you're nobody's fool

So welcome to the machine

Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright we told you what to dream

He loved to drive in his Jaguar

But I just need what's left of 
Today, and you can wash it all away.
When it all comes down and I'm feeling tired and afraid, 
You're always there, and seem come when 
I've nothing left to give away.

Now I wait for your winds to come and give me breath for 
Another day, and your rain to wash me.

I feel the rain coming. 
I feel it in my heart, take away my pain.
I feel the rain coming. 
Wash me down, wash me down.

Here comes the rain. 
Hold me now, just for awhile.

I feel like a candle flame in the wind. 
The dust of my deeds past, covers me, like a fading lie.

I feel the rain coming. 
I feel it in my heart, wash away my pain.
Wash me down, wash me down. 
I feel the rain coming.

Here comes the rain."

Pieces of insincerity
Are like the stuff upon which we feed.
Do I feed you?

The game of us and them we play.
On and on admit that we like it this way.

I'm upside down, inside out for you.
No matter what goes down, I'll still be there for you.

They say that like attracts like, we're one and the same.
To say you're one of my kind is to say,
We don't take the blame.
The box that all others find they need,
To make themselves more than they seem,
Only makes them scream.

It goes on and on, this insanity,
The game of us and them we play.
On and on admit that we like it this way.

I'm upside down, inside out for you.
No matter what goes down, I'll still be there for you.

We've seen the sun setting in their eyes.
It could be worse, it could be us.
Not another life time without you

Is everything I need to know
Just restin' in the afterglow (of your fire/love)

You
Yes, you have always been here
A feelin' deep inside
A feelin' that I could not see
Or touch, or try to hide

Never really reaching the lines

Such a twisted reality

It's like a dreamland
With time standing still
So make your big plans

And you got all your time
So you got the illusion that your doin' fine
So you smile in the mirror
Through the sadness your smile can't disguise
Why don't you come right out and say
Baby you can't take another day without me
You know I'm runnin' through your blood
You need me like a drug and you can't live without me...

Lost somewhere between heart and mind

She'll make you play
You said you go
But I
I gotta prove it to you

She'll push me
Over the edge

I know where to push

I had enough
Cause I've done it to you
And now I'm feeling the bruise

Tell the world
Tell the world
I'm holdin' on
And tell the world
Tell the world
I'm growing strong
Yeah

Movin' on
Thinkin' of you
And you
You're not thinkin' of me
When you take it on

We will be friends
Play me for a fool
You know I'm changing the game
I let you know
It's not up to you
For givin' in too

We'll tell the world
Tell the world
We'll tell the world
Tell the world

We'll tell the world
Tell the world

1607,Ratt,Tug of War,"When I'm alone and filled with promise
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
I don't believe that silence is golden
I don't want to stray
Sometimes daylight drives me crazy
When you believe in the one and all
Some black masks roll out their feelings
I don't want to stray
If it's something I might have said

Life is a tug of war
Slap in the face
Life is a tug of war
All over the place
Life is a tug of war
Let's cut to the chase
Every night I dream

Soon you'll think love really happens
Now you got me up against a wall
Something went wrong 
And I feel like crawlin back into your arms again
Show your faith I'm your friend

Life is a tug of war
A slap in the face
Life is a tug of war
A total disgrace
Life is a tug of war

Sorrow and pain
Life is a tug of war

Life is a tug of war

So give it all you got
And give it your best shot
If something's wrong then make it right

Guarding all the children, is not love the answer?
You cannot pretend your life is real

1624,Saigon Kick,Come Take Me Now,"Time, I'm dreamin' it all away, I can't find
The words to say but somehow I feel it's over
God, I'm down on my knees to pray, life slowly
Fades away, it just seems to last forever

Home, take me to the place, it's warm
And I'm not afraid, You shelter me from the rain

Lord, come take me now, I feel
That it's over, I feel that it's over
Lord, come take me now, I feel
That it's over, I feel that it's over

Lost, out here without a trace
Feeling all the pain, wondering if I'm insane
So, you think that yesterday is gone away, you wish
It was here to stay, it just doesn't seem the same

Lord, come take me now, I feel
That it's over, I feel that it's over
Lord, come take me now, I feel
That it's over, I feel that it's over

Lord, come take me now, I feel
That it's over, I feel that it's over

1625,Saigon Kick,Coming Home,"He says she said that the counters 
in the room was a paranoia
It's hard to believe the walls can breathe
But I see it in my eyes
I see it in my eyes

Pretty girls with painted faces
Dancing for the boys
Crazy dreams just how it seems
As you know she slowly passed me by

Coming home, oh-oh-oh
I'm coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh

Flying high to paper skies
Soaring through the heavens of shame
Find me now I never left the ground
Only how the stars remain the same
So the stars remain the same
So they remain the same

Coming home
Well I'm coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh

It's always the beautiful ones that let you down
They fall in love with the lust
They fall in love with sex
They fall in love with the faith
The faith, the faith, the faith in Hell

Coming home,
A-well I'm coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh

A-well it's one small thing I say to you
Is always keep control
Pretty girls with their painted faces
Dancing for the boys
Are coming home, home, home
Are coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, Coming home"

Where the little girls play

Sweet Larissa wants candy
Johnny wants her to stay
Sweet Larissa wants Johnny
But Johnny thinks he's gay

Time's always changing
And I don't know what to say
Same old story
Just a different day

Upstairs, turn right, take a look around
Your mama's not at home

Johnny's got a need
Johnny's got a needle
Johnny feels at home

1627,Saigon Kick,Eden,"Three little girls, they run up the street,
They're beginning to dance for all to see.
Wanting for something that they can't find,
So they shift their hips and they get in a little grind,
Singing oh oh oh oh, singing a la la la

Steal the bread from the baker man,
And you make a fist with an outstretched hand,
And you feed 'em something that they don't own,
And you burn down the teacher's home,
Singing oh oh oh oh, singing a la la la

Singing oh oh oh oh, singing a la la la

Chorus:
You and I are heading for the end of time and there's no rhyme.
All we know is crashing down; the absence of the heart is now.
Can you run a little faster; won't you try?
We must beat ourselves to Eden or we'll die.

Trying to act like we just don't care,
So we jump around like it just ain't fair.
Throw your neighbors to the ground
And you take your stuff and you head downtown,
Singing oh oh oh oh, singing a la la la

Chorus

Knock the one that you need the most,
And you kiss the ass of the holy ghost.
Trick your friends so they think you're cool,
And you get up on the floor of your school,
Singing oh, singing a la la la

1628,Saigon Kick,Feel the Same Way,"Saw the fire light. Had the same dream tonight.
Felt the fears of the endless night in the middle of the morning light.
We have disease gone crazy thoughts of revolution hazy.
Computer days are lazy.
I'm on the side of the man who's wiser.
I'm on the side with the gun that fires.
Lost a life tonight. Caused a little fright tonight.
Stole a dream of right.
Call me a man with a view that's wild.
Call me a man with a mind like a childs.
Can you feel the power? Watch them build the biggest tower.
Cry a little shower all in the site of a race that's leaving.
All for the right of a man you're killing

Hidden, yet to find
There's children behind an iron gate
Hiding swollen eyes

Change these fields of rape
Wash them away like the morning rain on your face
We gotta change these fields of rape
Take me away from the burning pain of this place

There is hunting in the fields of rape
And we've become the game
There is running in the fields of rape
Abolish all mankind

There is crying on the African soil
And life is hard to keep
There is dying in a Bosnian town
A girl of just sixteen

Change these fields of rape
Wash them away like the morning rain on your face
We gotta change these fields of rape
Take me away from the burning pain of this place

There is danger in the fields of rape
Not too far from where you walk

But somewhere there's a little child locked up inside your alybi's.
So take a bow for what you've done.

Freedom

They light the sky. So many die for what they see is wrong or right.
Your world it seems a puzzle piece. So close but we never see.

Our statue reads the words of peace. Those written before my time.
She holds the light for those who died, so die for me and pray for me.

Close your eyes my darling and you'll find the light.
Close your eyes my friend and they'll be no fright.
Close your eyes my darling and you'll find the way.

All the fire and all the hate won't change the feelings, won't change your fate.
So stop your crying and feed my faith. I'll kill your god and take his place.
Kill the leaches in your little dream. The bloods not spilling. It's not what it seems.
Hey, have you ever walked beneath the rain in hope of washing away the pain and all your tears?
Hey, have you ever talked of all the shame within your everlasting fear of me?

Catch me if I fall."

I may not have the mind of Jung
I cannot buy the things you need to have
But there is something you can't forget

I love you
I love you
Through the fires
And all the hell
It's something I can't stop

Let's give it one more try tonight, baby,
Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes,

And in the morning I'll be gone away
All the things I left behind
If you need me I'll come night or day
Lets stop the hands of time

Let's give it one more try tonight, baby,
Love is on the way

The hills wish they were mountains. And the weeds, to be trees.
In the years to come, we all run away from, away from, away from...

In the light of day I can still see the light, see the light.
Veins of red and blue dance on tracks in the night, in the night.

The world goes round. x 2

She will come to you with a scream for her life, for her life.
Act of god, part two. Her life bleeds off the knife, off the knife.

Is spinnin' round
You'll be digging your grave
About six feet under

Stringing you up

Isn't it grand and sometimes unfair?

Climb as high as you can
Talk to the stars and kiss them for me

All that you know, all gone away

Life isn't it vague?
Haziness, thoughts of one's reason to live

Fly so far away
Over the clouds and wait for me there

Is this your world? So far away
All that you know, all gone away, so far away

As I watched the sun touch down
To the last point of a dark, pale, violent night
Endless thoughts flowed through my mind
Like faint rainbows caressing the skies
We are the new world love clan

Crimes based on position
Not of a constant just a transition

Love is what they say
Binding the last safe thing but steals it away

All that you know, all gone away

Is this your world? So far away
All that you know, all gone away

Is this your world?"

Gotta get fast upon my feet

Gotta act way beyond my means

Said he was a continental man from Greece
Wasn't really sure what that meant but at least
Promised her the life of dreams and a king?
Wasn't too long before bells were to ring

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around

So they lived their life upon a great big hill
Wasn't too long before blood was to spill
Hit him in the back with a tool from the shed
Now she's upset because she thinks he is dead

When she turned he rose above the hardwood floor
[Unverified]
He was right behind her and swinging a bat
Landed on her head with a soft wet smack

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around and around and around

He would take the children down
Throw them all around the ground

Wipe some snot off on his sleeve
And say goodbye to the clown

He would pray twice every day
He would not tolerate the gay
Oh, oh, oh
I'm alright, I feel that I'm coming around

Sgt. Steve, with all his needs
He would weed out the impure
He would guard our sacred shores
From the red, from the blue ones

Though we beat them once before
He had a feelin', not very sure
That they were back
Boys for attack

So we slit his throat for fear
We heard their footsteps very near
And oh, oh, oh
I'm alright, I feel that I'm coming around

1653,Scorpions,Alien Nation,"In the heat of the violence
The night's exploding everywhere
When hate pulls the trigger
The devil comes to take his share

In the garden of Eden
The time is running out so fast
Into heart of the demon
With no escape our die is cast
 
In the city of angels
Death is just a moment away
In the city of angels
Your future won't see the light of the day
 
Beware of the alien nation
Beware of the truth that they seek
They pray for eternal salvation
They pray for your soul to keep
 
On the eve of destruction
A reign of terror rules the street
When the heads start rolling
The devil comes to let it bleed
 
In the city of angels
Death is just a moment away
In the city of angels
Your future won't see the light of the day
 
Walk on past the alien nation
Walk on to the end of your reach
No fear of the alien nation
No fear of the hatred they preach
 
Don't run, there's no place to hide 
Today or tomorrow it will get you
Don't move, the knife is right at your throat
And whatever you do, there's no way out

When the shroud comes down on this place
To bury us all alive
We'll know the time has come, to face the heat 

Beware of the alien nation
Beware of the truth that they seek
They pray for eternal salvation
They pray for your soul to keep

Walk on past the alien nation
Walk on to the end of your reach
They pray for eternal damnation
They pray for your soul to keep"

1655,Scorpions,Always Somewhere,"Arrive at seven the place feels good
No time to call you today
Encores till eleven then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again

I call your number the line ain't free
I like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love I can't tell you how I feel

Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again

Another morning another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again

Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again"

1657,Scorpions,Arizona,"Arizona really was a gas
I was screwed up in a total mess
Mind blowing all the way, you know
Just out of sight
Some girl stopped me in the street at night
Oh, what a knockout and she felt so right
Oh, yeah she took my breath away
Just out of sight

Loved her in her car
Took me to the stars
Babe, we went nuts all the way
Loved her on the moon
Morning came too soon
She got me high and loose, loose, loose

Arizona really feels alright
Girls swing here and they treat you right
Have so many special ways, you know
And that's alright
Was so hard to leave and say goodbye
I'd like to stay and have another try
Mind blowing all the way, you know
Just out of sight

Loved her in her car
Took me to the stars
Babe, we went nuts all the way
Loved her on the moon
Morning came too soon
She got me high and loose, loose, loose
 
Loved her in her car
Took me to the stars
Babe, we went nuts all the way
Loved her on the moon
Morning came too soon

1658,Scorpions,As Soon as the Good Times Roll,"If you feel real sad sometimes
Caught in bad vibrations
And it seems you've lost your drive
And your destination
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by
Catch the train of better times
Rock tonight

Hard times go
As soon as the good times roll
Hard times go
As soon as the good times roll

Is packed with complications
And almost everything you try
Ends up in new frustrations
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by
Catch the train of better times
Rock tonight

Hard times go
As soon as the good times roll
Hard times go
As soon as the good times roll"

If you don't catch me now
I can't stop falling down

Baby our love will find a way
As long as we believe in love"
1662,Scorpions,Big City Nights,"When the daylight is falling down into the night
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune
Which never stand still

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights

When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before
But it's more like looking out for something
I can't find anymore

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning

There is no dream
That you can't make true, if you're looking for love
But there's no girl
Who's burning the ice away from my heart
Maybe tonight!

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning"
1663,Scorpions,Born to Touch Your Feelings,"I was born from the sound of the strings
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling

Close your eyes and I'll try to get in
To waken your heart like the sping
'cause I was born to touch your feelings

Steal the time, take a song and be glad
Be free as the birds, don't be sad
Your time will come, I'll make you feel it
You're still young like the sun after rain
Follow the light it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings

You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right
You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right

You were born just to lose or to win
To be someone's chime in the wind
To live between your mind and feelings
Find your way, check it out
Learn each day
Follow the light, it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings

You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right
You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right

The language of your body
Is right now all need
To understand you're ready for love

 A different guy and a better lover
 For your love, for your life check your way.
 And you like the rock 'n' roller
 A different life and whiskey Cola
 But don't be low keep your own style
 And catch your train!

 Don't be lazy man and work off your ass,
 He's the boss you've gotta do what he says!

 Catch your train, run and forget those ways,
 Keep it cool it's not too late!

For my dose of the news
Crawl right back in the sack girl
Had enough of the truth

Spend your dollars and rubels
Buy a piece of the wall
Build it up in your backyard
I'm so sick of it all
 
Ooh, it's a crazy world
Ooh, it's a crazy world
 
Drivin' down to the city
Doin' 155
Better late than never
I'm more dead than alive

We can find the Titanic
Put a man on the moon
But we can't fix out backyard
Man we better start soon

The more I feel we need to change

I get up (In a crazy, crazy world)
We all live (In a crazy, crazy world)
Ooh yeah (It's a crazy, crazy world)
I gotta get out (Of this crazy, crazy world)
 
Goin' home to my baby
It's been another hard day
Bust my balls for the tax man
So what else can I say

They spent our money on missiles
For the third world war
Now they're stacked in my backyard
We don't need them no more

1668,Scorpions,Crossfire,"It seems to me a nightmare becomes reality
The last days of the paradise are gone for you and me
We're living in the crossfire
And we'll be killed at first

Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world
Understand that we don't want to fight
Understand that we are mush too young to die
Understand no one will survive
Understand that we love our life

Can I trust the meaning of the life line in my hand
Which is as long as exciting hundred years
I could be a lucky man
But I'm living in the crossfire
Of a time that starts to burn

Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world
Understand that we don't want to fight
Understand that we are mush too young to die
Understand no one will survive
Understand that we love our life"
1669,Scorpions,Crying Days,"Force yourself to use your brain,
The only way to gain,
A lot of things are just a lie.
This world we love comes down in pain
With hate and bloody games
A question-mark up in the sky.

Look, you can't keep away
And you can't hide
Tomorrow, yesterday, today ...

Some people say, we'll do it better
Some people say, everything's good
Some people sing, let's come together
But nobody has ever brought it through
Maybe you and me ..."

She didn't want to know what I'd got to say
Just shook her head and looked the other way
And then she said, I've met your type before
For me you're all the same, you're such a bore

[Chorus:]
Oh no, don't make no promises
Oh no, your body can't keep

Next day, can you believe, she was at the show

Listen to the evening wind
Singing tunes of (tel aviv)?

Dreaming colors deep

Flag broken on the ground
Ringing fire blazing round
Where are your friends
You see all hope
Lying broken on a slope
Today all life is gone

Have a listen and you will see my friends
Wind is telling you the truth"
1676,Scorpions,Every Minute Every Day,"Well it seems that I was lost
In intoxicated nights
Following the trace of ecstasy
With no future and no past
Just the present was alive
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream

I was drowning in a feeling
That obsession rules
'till the morning kills the creatures of the night
And I read your lipstick message
On the mirror of the truth
Now that you're gone I realize
Without you
Life's like a song without music
Without you
This world won't be the same

I need your love, every minute
I need your love, every day
I need your love, every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

Well I know that I was lost
In the nightmare of my life
Following the flash of fantasy
In a feeling that exploded
I'd left reality behind
Addicted to the power of a dream
Without you
Life's like that road that leads nowhere
Without you
The world won't feel the same

I need your love, every minute
I need your love, every day
I need your love, every minute
I need your love, come back and stay"

So many things are wrong
So many ways, so many ways
Flying through the sky forever
into another time

Yesterday so far away
Many miles together
Were looking for a way

Day by day
So far away
All the world
To do the same

So we go together
Will you show me the way
Time has gone
It has gone

Far away, far away

And today
I'll see a way
Follow me we love you
Just listen, what I say

Forget your name and yesterday
Put out your hand
I'll do the same

Now were going to another land
Will you show me the way
Time has gone
It has gone far away

He's so bright and he is so great
Come on or it's too late

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly

See the rainbow in the sun
The man will not go
And the world they have no fun
Hurry up people run

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly

All together
Fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly"
1680,Scorpions,Fly to the Rainbow,"Life is empty, can't remember anytime before,
On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore,
Gliding through this life, and another is a child,
And we're doing games, and losing things,
Always playing gigs.

Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright,
Where the sun is shining, in the night.
I am in disgrace, yet I see a smiling face,
And I hope you let me, share your place.
I don't live today.

Rain in the sky , make the world fly,
Into time, beg me your time.
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,
Into time, beg me your time.

Rain in the sky , make the world fly,
Into time, beg me your time.
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,
Into time, beg me your time.

Rain in the sky , make the world fly,
Into time, beg me your time.
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,
Into time, beg me your time.

Well, I lived in magic solitude
Of cloudy-looking mountains
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops 
Roaming through Space ten thousand years ago
I've seen the giant city of Atlantis
Sinking to eternal waves of darkness 

Somewhere in the blue distance
Are those long-forgotten trees of yore
A broken violin floating alone in December
Darkness everywhere and nothing more.

Symbol, strange Symbol, Melancholy
Painting torrid colors to a sky of green
Candle breathing one night only
Far away, in chillness, bleak, unseen

Drifting galley, ghostlike shadow,
Sails rigged to catch and kill the Time
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow
To call the Thing 
Sublime!"
1681,Scorpions,He's A Woman She's A Man,"I saw it walkin' lonely down the street
Cool like a cat, like crazy clean
I looked twice again, I can't believe
Oh no no no
 
It turned around right then and looked at me
I said oh no, it really couldn't be
It was a man, it was a woman, too

He's a woman
She's a man
He's a woman
She's a woman

I think it really came from far away
I'm feeling hypnotized, I have to stay
It takes my hand and says come on, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
We're goin' home, it's nice and warm to say
He starts to move, she starts to play
I need a body, why not you

He's a woman

Perfume of the skies ?
Fingers cold as ice ? freeze ?
Devil in disguise!

Well, she's a, she's a, she's a
You know that she's a hell-cat, hell-cat, hell-cat, hell-cat
(She's gonna scratch up your mind ?)
You know that guy with piccadilly-eyes
Was talking to the French boy
But didn't realize.
Banana-long-boat-eating
An' he tried to get a wife
But he couldn't stay alive
Well, you know that lad with the rubber-dad
Paints his fingers yellow, blue, and red.
An' you also know that she's a liar
Knowing only her desire ?"

Searchin' for love that lasts forever

There's just one thing that's on my mind
 
Is it lust, is it love
Whatever it is I can't get enough
Is it lust, is it love
When I look around tell me who can I trust
Is it love

Sometimes it's hard to know
If this will be a night to treasure
When the damage has been done
And the hurting has begun
You'll justify a moment's pleasure

Whatever it is I can't get enough

It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above

Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose

He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

They tried to break me with their rules
But they had no chance at all
'Cause I knew what to do
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll

I had a feeling they couldn't buy
Still got that feeling they still can't buy,
They still can't buy,

To what I'm doing, but I guess
There's no other way of life
Which is strong like this
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll"

So many worlds away

I meet my girl, she's dressed to kill
And all we gonna do
Is walk around to catch the thrill
On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo

Enjoy the zoo
And walk down 42nd Street
You wanna be excited too
And you will feel the heat

We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo"
1732,Scorpions,They Need a Million,"I see a rainbow in the sky
So many colors and the light
I see the world and I see all the people
How they're running all the time

I see your shadow over me
Then in my ears I hear a symphony
I see the world and I see all the people
What they are doing what they need

They need a million and a billion
And your money too
They need a million and a billion
And your money too

I feel fine though I realize
That I don't need the million
They are all poor

I feel fine though I have eyes
To see my world and all it skits on ice

I feel fine though I realize
That I don't need the million
They are all poor

I feel fine though I have eyes
To see my world and all it skits on ice"
1733,Scorpions,This Is My Song,"I can't believe what the people say
There's only hate everywhere
So many people go different ways
So many things don't you care

They see nobody, they see themselves
But a stage like in a show
They see the hell, and they need your help
They need your help, they need love, love

This is my song
I tell you about the story of love
This is my song
I tell you about the story of love

This is my song
I tell you about the story of love
This is my song
I tell you about the story of love

I think I need you, you need me too
The place where we live is here
The world is griping what can I do
For you and you everywhere

I sing this song 'bout the world of love
And hope you hear what I say
Forever freedom, forever love
Forever love everyday"
1734,Scorpions,To Be with You in Heaven,"You can shoot me down
You can drag me 'round
Girl I'll get you
It won't be long
You can smash my heart
You can trash our love
But my desire for you is much too strong
 
To be with in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills
 
You can waste my time
But you can't change my mind
I won't stop you
So just go on
You can play your games
But it's all in vain
'Cause my desire for you is much too strong
 
To be with in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills

To be with in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills
 
Girl I'm on fire
Heaven seems so close tonight
Girl I would die for your love
 
You can shoot me down
You can drag me 'round
Girl I'll get you
It won't be long
You can smash my heart
You can trash our love
But my desire for you is much too strong

To be with in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills

To be with in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills

To be with in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills..."
1735,Scorpions,Top of the Bill,"You're a rock-n-roll star
You are out of the charts
Your blood is cold you're getting old
But your life is rock-n-roll
 
That crazy rock-n-roll band
Is spinning in your head (in your head)
Each and every way ya make the thoughts
Is about stars on the chart

Ohhh... and they are top of the bill
 
You're a rock-n-roll star
You've been the first one on the chart
You've had glory and fame
Rock-n-roll was your game

Ohhh... and you were top of the bill"
1736,Scorpions,Twentieth Century Man,"In the jungle of these times
Honest love's so hard to find
In the world of video
Computers tell you what to do
The world's devoted to the Dollar sign
 
Remote-controlled and on the line
Plug in man on the rack
Waiting for a heart attack
And no chance to die

No more space for love
The world gets really tough
Can't you see the end
Twentieth Century Man?

In the jungle of these times
There's nothing left for them to buy
They look for God on the screen
They've got even dream-machines
They are mesmerized

 No more space for love
 The world gets really tough
 Can't you see the end
 Twentieth Century Man?
 
 No more space for love
 The world gets really tough
 Can't you see the end
 Twentieth Century Man?"
1737,Scorpions,Virgin Killer,"Cry like you feel,
Try like you feel, feel it!
Try to escape,
Cry to escape, escape it!
It's so hard to run away
He's a virgin killer 

No, no, no, can't you see?
No, no, no, can't you see?
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,
You're a demon's desire!

Death on the screen,
Sadistic magazines, watch out
Suicides ev'ryday,
Political ways, get it
Well, you can't find new ways 
But he's a virgin killer 
 
No, no, no, can't you see?
No, no, no, can't you see?
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,
You're a demon's desire!

Garbage in the streams,
A-bombs in your dreams, look out
Sharks in the pictures,
Exorcist prescriptions, forget it
Try to get away from that,
'cause he's a virgin killer 

No, no, no, can't you see?
No, no, no, can't you see?
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,
You're a demon's desire!"
1738,Scorpions,Walking on the Edge,"Welcome to a trip
 Into my hurt feelings
 To the center of my soul
 You better bring a light
 To find the house of meanings
 In the labyrinth of yeas or no
 For you, life is just like chess
 If you don't make a move
 You'll lose the game like this

 Cause you, you're walking on the edge
 You, you chose the way of love and pain
 You, don't you see the bridge
 I've built for you, it's just one step to start again

 Welcome to a trip
 Into my emotions
 To the language of my heart
 You're sailing on a river
 That becomes an ocean
 Which you can only cross with love
 For you, life is just like chess
 If you don't make a move
 You'll lose the game like this

 Cause you, you're walking on the edge
 You, you chose the way of love and pain
 You, don't you see the bridge
 I've built for you, it's just one step to start again"
1739,Scorpions,We Let It Rock...You Let It Roll,"We come to you through a storm of lightning
To drive this place totally insane
Another show that really keeps us fighting
For what it takes to blow your mind away
Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you hear me now
Let me hear you too

We come to you through a wall of thunder
Electrified by the sound of the guitars
Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you see me now
I want to see you out there

We let it rock to free your energy
You let it roll, come on get on your feet
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy

We come to you through a burst of fire
Energized by the feedback of the crowd
Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you feel me now
Can you feel the groove

You let it roll, come on get on your feet

You let it roll, up to the ecstasy"
1740,Scorpions,We'll Burn the Sky,"I'm in love with the sunshine
I'm in love with the fallin' rain
Everything seems to call your name
Yesterday you were leavin'
Leavin' life and all your pain
Everything wants you back again
Wants you back again
Wants you back again

I found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt always naturally high
And my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
You're my life giving fire
And you carry all my love
Through you I was so inspired
You're engraved deep in my heart
Heart, heart, heart

My dreams recall us being one
I've searched for you to be free
The force of life you have always been
I feel blue since you're gone
You're breath of life surrounded me
When can I join you to be free
Join you to be free
Join you to be free

Wait, can this be a dream
There is a voice in my head
It belongs to you, it says
Don't cry, no need to be sad
There's a way to stay with you again
It's more than you ever had
And no death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are my other part

I know we've never been apart
Your love sets fire to my heart
We'll burn the sky
When it's time for me to die
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah
When it's time, time, time
We'll burn the sky
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah"
1741,Scorpions,When the Smoke Is Going Down,"Just when you make your way back home
I find some time to be alone
I go to see the place once more
Just like a thousand nights before
I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

This is the place where I belong
I really love to turn you on
I've got your sound still in my ear
While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

I climb the stage again this night
'Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down"
1742,Scorpions,Yellow Raven,"The yellow raven sipped the air
Of thunder and of rain
The yellow raven sipped the air
Gentle lies kissing the rain

Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?
Take me away to somewhere
Take me away from here!
Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?
Answer to my yearning
Take me away from here!

The fire bird began to cry
When the music died away
The fire bird began to cry
And smoke was slowly drifting by

Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?
Take me away to somewhere
Take me away from here!
Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?
Answer to my yearning
Take me away from here"
1743,Scorpions,You Give Me All I Need,"New love is blind
Why don't you see
You hurt me inside, you're killing me
It makes me sad all the time

To see you around with all these guys
My heart's in pain
I need you so
My love's the same
So please don't go

You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need

Let's try again
There's still romance
We'll start a new life, take a chance
There are so many ways

Please don't forget it anyday
My heart's in pain
I need you so
My love's the same
So please don't go

1744,Scorpions,Your Light,"When you're feeling lost and blue
When there is no love for you
You'll find him and it's all right
It's all right, it's all right
When you're feeling down and low
When you've got no place to go
And when no one smiles hello
He's by your side, you know
When you're getting deaf and blind
When you drag one leg behind
And when you're finally gonna
Lose your mind
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right
'Cause he is by your side
'Cause he will be your guide
'Cause he will be your light
And you're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, you're not alone

1745,Skid Row,Beat Yourself Blind,"Give me a minute 'cause I'm wrapped in superstition
Pour me a chemical to take away the edge
Don't make up anything that's breaking all your fingers
Just slap around a bit of what it takes to pledge

Carry out another stone as a slave
Ask general-know-it-all, who's juggling the earth?
Tease all the natives that will walk across your grave
And shove aside your nation all for what it's worth

Beat yourself blind [Repeat x6]
An open eyes and a closed mind

Look at the suit in suspended animation
A faded outline that used to be a man
A piece of paper that's fallen out a window
Has got a better chance to know where it will land

To bleed in vain, to bleed in vain, under my eyes are painted skies
Down at the bone yard, they're diggin' up the relics
Handfuls of parasites thrown into machines
I got the phone call they're tearin' down the mission
The zombies had a ball, but don't know what it means

Beat yourself blind"
1746,Skid Row,Big Guns,"She was a ballerina on a subway train
Stiletto heels and a candy cane
Looked like a number on a station wall
Hot on the tail of a social call

I wet my lips I thought I had it made
Like Valentino with a hand grenade
I made my move with my libido on
She circled once and then she dropped the bomb

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Blew me away
And I went down in flames

I met a sidewalk preacher on a roller skate
He said he had the key to heaven's gate
I said: ""I'll wait for the movie 'cause I been there before""
And learned: like is a battle and love is war

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Took me by surprise
She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Blew me away
And I went down in flames

I'm doing time as a back seat Romeo
Play solitaire with my hands in the air
Another night and no bullets to spare

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Took me by surprise
She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Blew me away
And I went down in flames

Big guns (Big guns)
Big guns, blew me away
And I went down in flames

Big guns, big guns
She really, really got the big guns
She shot me down in flames"
1747,Skid Row,Blitzkrieg Bop,"Hey ho let's go
They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds

The blitzkrieg bop
They're piling in the back seat
They're generation steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat

The blitzkrieg bop
Hey ho let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, i don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go."
1748,Skid Row,Bonehead,"Is there a problem? The laugh of the rich man
Has got you crying poor
Are you as heavy as hell in a handbag
Or just a virgin whore?
If the weight of the world is on your shoulders
Then carry it for a day
Do you cry for peace or peace of mind;
Is reality in the way?

Enter the martyr out through the in door
The savior has arrived?
Is all your anger force of habit
And keeping you alive?
An empty shotgun shooting your mouth off
Something's on your mind
The cheap messiah of persecution
Is alive and doing fine

I won't leave if you stay, I don't buy what you say
If you're a new God let me see a miracle
I won't leave if you stay, I don't buy what you say
I can't say that you're a fool,
but if you're a new God let me see a miracle."
1749,Skid Row,Breakin' Down,"What was it you once said
That there would be things in life that couldn't be
Not for a second did I believe you
Not for a minute did I believe that

Within your need you lie alone
This empty space you call your home

If you just let me in
I wouldn't let you break down
I'm breakin' down

As if you thought the rain could wash away the day
And could heal you
Not for a second did I believe it
Not for a minute did I believe that

Within your need you lie alone
This empty space you call your home

What was it you once said
That there would be things in life that couldn't be
Not for a second did I believe you
Not for a minute did I believe that"
1750,Skid Row,C'Mon And Love Me,"She's a dancer, a romancer
I'm a Capricorn and she's a Cancer
She saw my picture in a music magazine

When she met me, said she'd get me
Touched her hips and told me that she'd let me
I took her hand, baby, this is what I said,
I said

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, don't you hesitate
'Cause I just can't wait
Baby, won't you take me down on my knees
You can do what you please
C'mon and love me

I'm a man, I'm no baby, and you're lookin' every inch a lady
You're good lookin' and you're lookin' like you should be good
You were distant, now you're nearer
I can feel your face inside the mirror
The lights are out and I can feel you, baby, with my hand

So

1751,Skid Row,Can't Stand the Heartache,"Fall in love with a twisted lady
Suicide with a cover girl
Spent all your time then you got stuck paying the price

Uptown, kick it down, into a spin
Face the wall, take it all, you just can't win

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
Can't stand, can't stand the heartache

You got caught in the line of fire
Bystander innocence
You held your own till it wasn't yours anymore

Waste away another day into the night
You're at home by the phone, it don't seem right

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
Can't stand, can't stand the heartache

You held me like a prisoner
And I don't know
Why I stayed here from the start

Uptown, run me down under your wheels
I pray, one day, you'll know how it feels

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
Can't stand, can't stand the heartache

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
Can't stand, can't stand the heartache

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart

Can't stand, can't stand the heartache"
1752,Skid Row,Creepshow,"Zoned out afternoon
Let's catch ""who's on top of who""
Tell it like it is
'Cause it isn't anyway

Much to my surprise
I caught it right between the thighs
My sweet little sister
Was layin' me away

My jaw dropped dead to the table
She put my cool in shock
Crack kills and blood spills baby
But psychos, dykes and transvestites
Are on the choppin' block

Oh no I saw my baby on the creepshow
Out on spillin' my guts on the news
Oh no I caught my woman on the creepshow
Hit me with a shovel 'cause I can't believe that I dug you

She filled my boots with lead
Was it something that I said
A picture paints a thousand ugly words

Baby's acting tough
Check out my fisticuffs
That's just what she deserves

I can't flip from the station
Can't unplug what's done
Her six-foot-deep temptation
She nicked my skin, and then kicked me in
And then she buried me for fun

Oh no I saw my baby on the creepshow
Out on spillin' my guts on the news
Oh no I caught my woman on the creepshow
Hit me with a shovel 'cause I can't believe that I dug you

My jaw dropped dead to the table
She put my cool in shock
Crack kills and blood spills baby
But psychos, dykes and transvestites
Are on the choppin' block"
1753,Skid Row,Delivering the Goods,"Feeling rock queers, we're ready to kick tonight
No time to hesitating, my body's aching
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
Charging, vain grace, as active as the hundreds size of proof
Megation, reliving on, we're ready to hit  the room

You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're here and your way like a dynamite  
Delivering the goods  
Delivering the goods

Shake down, rock them boys, crack that whip strip me
Want straight, airwaves, find a rather newer places down
Stealing your hearts all across the land
Hot blood doing good, we're gonna load it with our friend

You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're here and your way like a dynamite  
Delivering the goods  
Delivering the goods

Hey your way, stay your way
Oh it's all gonna punches, we aim with the crunches
Laugh until we send it to your brain
If we look before we fell, we knock but more than yell
Gonna do it again and again
We'll beat you into submission so you might as well surrender
Do come over and listen, just the angle by you're hearing the picture
Bust up, ah, 'til the seams that we're gonna break
Shoot further, giving more than you're ever gonna take
Leading your heads crushed down on the floor
Begging for mercy, be careful or I'll do it some more

You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're here and your way like a dynamite  
Delivering the goods

1754,Skid Row,Fire in the Hole,"Why not just skin me like a yankee pig?
This neo-nazi stuff just ain't my gig
Still ain't sure what you had in mind
I picked it from the stench you left behind
Steady drip of memory for my head
Bet you got jealousidal tendencies
Could I wind up dead

Something going around Then there's fire in the hole
Cover me I'm going down
Then there's fire in the hole
Unlucky white kid didn't leave with the blues
Paint balls of fire he had a ball with dio
Give us love while we're covered in blood
Flying high but ain't sure which way is up
Crash landing in the submarines
Belly up to the enemy

Something going around then there's fire in the hole
Cover me I'm going down then there's fire in the hole
I even sinking fast on the ship of souls
Cover me I'm going down then there's fire, there's fire in the hole

There's something going around Then there's fire in the hole
Cover me I'm going down Then there's fire in the hole
Am I even sinking fast on the ship of souls
Cover me I'm going down"
1755,Skid Row,Firesign,"Sailing ships go through my mind
Past wreckage on the way
Glory seekers fall in line
Getting closer
Summer laugh, some will cry
What will summer bring!
Some will take her by the reins
And ride the suffering

On a carousel through my yesterdays
Doubt sees the obstacles
Faith sees the way

All the ways you kill me
They've begun to thrill me
Nothing there fulfills my firesign
Brotherhood betrayal,
Sabotage to no avail
Nothing there can kill my firesign

Beaten, burned, I'll take the fall
And get up right in your face
Walk all over what I believe
But I'm still here, you disappear
Without a trace
No need to follow, no need to lead
No need to beg or borrow
I just need to be me"
1756,Skid Row,Forever,"Remember when we were young 
Just two kids on the run 
With our fists full of dreams 

Took it awhile, playin' it cool 
Stayed up late cuttin' school 
While lightin' cigarettes, like James Dean 

In the backseat of my Chevrolet 
Where the radio would play and play 
And all the world would fade away 

Together we stand 
Well, its just you and me 
So baby, hold on and you'll see 
Forever we stand 
And we'll make it through 
'Cause I know that I can't live without you no, no, no

They said we're growin' up too fast 
What we had would never last 
So we left without goodbyes 

And then some times, well, they got tough 
Roads ahead looked kinda rough 
And all we had was you and I 

We prayed to God on those cold, dark nights 
And then we knew that it would be alright 
We'd go through hell just to hold each other tight 

Together we stand 
Well, its just you and me 
So baby, hold on and you'll see 
Forever we stand 
And we'll make it through 
'Cause I know that I can't live without you

As long as the world keeps turning, 
As long as there's another day 
Together, forever we'll stay, yeah

In the backseat of my Chevrolet 
Where the radio would play and play 
And all the world would fade away, yeah 

Together we stand 
Well, its just you and me 
So baby, hold on and you'll see 
Forever we stand 
And we'll make it through 
'Cause I know that I can't live without you 

Forever, forever 
Forever we stand 
Forever, forever 
Forever we stand"

The box I keep myself in, closes out my air
So I build a fire, so I can sit and stare

(Can it be I'm frozen)

As I stare into the weather
My eyes drying from the cold
As I stare into the weather
I sense my thoughts growing old

I listen to the prophets predict the stem of tides
I stare into the weather that's keeping me inside

(Can it be I'm frozen)

As I stare into the fire
Will the prophets change my mind
While I stare into the fire
All the colors treat me kind

I'll dust away the fallings the winter leaves for me
I'll stare into the fire and set tomorrow free

1762,Skid Row,I Remember You,"Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time you there for me

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights through every endless day
I'd want to hear you say, I remember you oh oh

We spent the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said I love you babe, without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights through every endless day
I'd want to hear you say, I remember you

We've had our share of hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
Oh my darling, I love you

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights through every endless day
I'd want to hear you say, I remember you

1763,Skid Row,In a Darkened Room,"In a darkened room
Beyond the reach of God's faith
Lies the wounded, the shattered remains of love betrayed
And the innocence of a child is bought and sold
In the name of the damned
The rage of the angels left silent and cold

Forgive me please for I know not what I do
How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true

Tell me when a kiss of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room

All the precious times have been put to rest again
And the smile of the dawn
Brings tainted lust singing my requiem
Can I face the day when I'm tortured in my trust
And watch the crystallize
While my salvation it crumbles to dust

Why can't I steer the ship before it hits the storm
I've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shore

Tell me when a kiss of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room"
1764,Skid Row,Into Another,"Slowly I heal the love that's found its way
Onto another path in times of change
Crossing a bridge unknown

Should they both let go then let me lay
Let me lay

Show me a sign
To a light that shines
One direction into another
Sheltered peace of mind

Somehow I know my legs will carry me
Searching for circles end
Hoping the wounds will mend
Should this scar, then it was meant to be"

Stand atop it all outside the status quo

No see, no speak then know where you're goin'
Drag your feet then nothing you're showin'
Take your place or fall to the lions
Lose your face and stand where you're dying

Living in a hole is taking its toll
My iron will's in position
Seize you are not owed, stand or fall
And refuse to be denied

Pride is all in vain without the blood of need
Bones can break in shame from taking charity
Hide from all the hell and wash up with the tide
Wait and you commit psychological suicide

Break the molds of beg and submission
Wake the dead or no one will listen
Holding ground is just the beginning
It's uphill bound and in for the killing"

A hungry politician is the wolf that's at the door
Hell-bent submission and feedin' on the poor
We could stare into the sun if we would open up your eyes

Busted on the rockpile - getting dusted in the heat
Shackled to the system - and draggin' my feet

I'm riding on a breakdown - another whiteknuckled shakedown
Feels like I'm livin' on a chain gang
I'm riding on a breakdown - a suicidal shakedown
Feels like I'm on a chain gang

A con man's intuition can wash your sins away
Send your contribution and he'll save your soul today
What can he know, has he been through hell and back
He takes the cash and drives it home in a brand new Cadillac

Spitting at the guard dog, burning in his wicked deal
Screamin' down the railroad with no one at the wheel

I'm riding on a breakdown another whiteknuckled shakedown
Feels like I'm livin' on a chain gang
I'm riding on a breakdown a suicidal shakedown

Cold blooded criminal mind
Getting off on high position

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Captain Fantastic. The nineteen seventies

Dive head-on into you, Dive head-on into you
Dive head-on into you, Dive head-on into you

Bury the news with the views from
behind
the door
Rattle the bones with the drones at the
Corner store, see them for myself

Commies, kinks and masochists
Weirdos, love and homicide
Witches, freaks and 45s
Kick a painted pony let the spinning wheel ride"

1780,Skid Row,See You Around,"I never promised you the sunshine
You never handed me the moon
We're pulling threads out of our faded silver lining
We've grown out of our cocoon

The last train is leaving
There's nothing more that I can say
I didn't mean to bring you down
I guess I'll see you around

I left the best of my intentions
Took it one day at a time
It's not like all is lost or that the world is ending
We've just fallen from the vine

The last train is leaving
There's nothing more that I can say
I didn't mean to bring you down

Rest assured the one thing we know
Things just really didn't go our way

1781,Skid Row,Slave to the Grind,"You got me forced to crack my lids in two 
I'm still stuck inside the rubber room 
I gotta punch the clock that leads the blind 
I'm just another gear in the assembly line-oh no 

The noose gets tighter around my throat 
But I ain't at the end of my rope 

'Cause I won't be the one left behind 
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind 
Tear down the rat racial slime 
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind 
Get it? 

A routine injection, a lethal dose 
But my day in the sun ain't even close 
There's no need to waste your prayers on me 
You better mark my words 'cause I'm history, yes indeed 

You might beg for mercy to get by 
But I'd rather tear this thorn from my side 

'Cause I won't be the one left behind 
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind 
Tear down the rat racial slime 
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind 

They swallowed their daggers by turning their trick 
They tore my intentions apart brick by brick 
I'm sick of the jive 
You talk verbal insecticide

1782,Skid Row,Subhuman Race,"Jesus knows my story, he knows the position that I'm in
A hooker knows the feeling to get fucked the way I've been
Turn my insides out; your mouth drank my water

You look at me like I'm subhuman
You talk to me like I'm subhuman
You're treating me like I'm subhuman
You're jumping into the subhuman race

Brothers hear my story, but don't you take no pity out on me
A soldier knows the feeling to get pushed out in a field
Taking liberties; burned by your dictation"
1783,Skid Row,Sweet Little Sister,"She blew my mind behind the wrecking machine
She was a shitload of trouble called the Subway Queen
Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene

One night I caught her running out the cellar door
There was about a million people lying flat on the floor
For such a sweet little lady I would swear she's rotten to the core

She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of her car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later

I know a thing or two about, sweet little sister
Her mom would kill her if she knew what she do, sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue, sweet little sister
Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little, sweet little sister 

Every quittin' time is another disease
Too many cowboys ridin' high shootin' low at the knees
The back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze

The pettin's getting heavy got his tongue in her ear
Her friend is doing time for kickin' ass on a queer
They're in a mental state and all their friends are here

She's tellin' lies through her burgundy lips
Angel on a mission of mercy
She'll get you dancin' with the crack of her whip
Take you up to heaven in her rocket ship

I know a thing or two about, sweet little sister
Her mom would kill her if she knew what she do, sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue, sweet little sister
Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little, sweet little sister 

She got her hands in the cookie jar smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of her car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later

I know a thing or two about, sweet little sister

1784,Skid Row,The Threat,"I've been convicted with and without reason
Tarred and feathered like a piper on a killing spree
And felt the anger of generations
And been a target for a cheap shots of authority

So you think you cut me down to size
Well there's something you should realize
It's gonna take more than a break in the law
To make me smile pretty for the wreckin' ball

Won't beg, won't bleed
The end of sacrifice is a threat to society
Hard line, you'll see
Once you've made a mark, you've made a threat to society

I wasn't put there to be treated
Like some disease you hoped would go away if left alone
You can sweep me under the carpet
But, I'll still infect your need to use me as a steppin' stone

[Chorus:]
Got 3-D vision, live in cyberspace
Oh what a rush, oh what a place, oh yeah

Can we find a way to shine an inner light
Can we find a way to make it work out right

We should meditate a higher conscious
Listen in peace, in peace and harmony
All I want to do, all I want to do
Is brighten your darkest days

So do you hear my message of love

The time has come for me to fly

You know you keep me hangin' on
It's our love that makes me strong
You're the world to me for eternity

So I'm looking back on yesterday
And how we laughed until we cried
And we feel it as we're all growing older
It's so hard to say good-bye
Once again it's hard to say good-bye

As I stare into the hourglass of life
I think of how I left you then
When my life is over and all is said and done
You can hear me sing this song again

You know you keep me hangin' on
It's our love that makes me strong
You're the world to me for eternity

So I'm looking back on yesterday
And how we laughed until we cried
And we feel it as we're all growing older
It's so hard to say good-bye
Once again it's hard to say good-bye

In the heat of the moment
When two bodies are melting as one
Embers fallin' down from the fire above

I lift you up why can't you see
For you, Heaven it cries

Mary, Mary full of grace show me your love
And let it reign forever
The miracles that you create were sabotaged
By those who hate...why
Tell me is it all in my mind
Show me what I'm going to find

""Fear not, for I have redeemed you
I have summoned you by name, you are mine
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you
And when you pass through the rivers
They will not sweep over you
When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned
The flames will not set you ablaze""
Tell me am I wasting my time
Show me why are we all so blind

Ya better pay attention when I'm talkin' to you
I've been around here for a long, long time
Could have bought this land for damn near a dime

So I headed on over, leaned against his truck
And ya better hear me out or you're shit outta luck
I've been through times that you wouldn't believe
It makes a man feel about a hundred and three
Again he asked, what do ya do
I can't imagine by lookin' at you
Boy, things have changed since way back when
I wish that I was back in my teens again
I said hey, I said hey, to what the old man said
So we hopped in his truck, went for a ride
He talked about things before I was alive
Ya know, that used to be a big mining town
My brother and I brought that mountain down
My oh my, look how they built over there
Have ya ever thought about cutting that hair
Ya never told me what do ya do
Tell me kid, are ya just passing through
You say hey, you say hey, from what the old man said
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried

So, low and behold when all was told the only listening one was me
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to break on through
So, low and behold when all was told the stubburn one was he
So the moral of the story is ya gotta learn a lesson

1825,Steelheart,Can't Stop Me Lovin' You,"I remember the days when our lives were so complete 
We had each other, love was all we would need 
But now you have changed since the first day that we met 
You found a new lover, it's me you want to forget 
You tried to tell me our love was in vain 
I'm a victim of your love babe, and you're to blame 

You can't stop the rain from fallin', you can't stop the sun shining through 
'Cause I'll be there forever holdin', you can't stop me lovin' you 

Now that you're gone, life is empty and cold 
Oh how I miss having you to hold 
My nights are sleepless, I'll never be the same 
Living without you I'm going insane 
And as I sit here wipin' tears from my eyes 
How can I make you come to realize 

You can't stop the rain from fallin', you can't stop the sun shining through 
'Cause I'll be there forever holdin', you can't stop me lovin' you 

Well I'll be here, ready and waiting, waiting to love you 
Everything that I do reminds me of you 
You can't stop me from lovin' you 

You can't stop the rain from fallin', you can't stop the sun shining through 
'Cause I'll be there forever holdin', you can't stop me lovin' you 

You can't stop the rain from fallin', you can't stop the sun shining through

But not like the one I met last night 
She said boy I really like your style, forgive me if I appear too wild 
But I want to mow you down like a freight train 

I jumped back, I saw the fire in her eyes 
Well I started shaking in my shoes 
She said relax babe, you're in good hands 
Oh tell me what have you got to lose 

Chorus: 
Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor 
Shake shake it up babe and shake it up some more

Shake shake it up babe and shake it up some more 

Back seat she was running hot, she said baby give me all you got 
Time for dirty dog to come feed the kitty 
We were bumpin' and grindin' all night, hanging on with all my might 
Rollin' till the train was running off the tracks 

The smoke cleared, I looked into her lovin' eyes 
Well I knew my love was on the line 
I said girl I'd be a fool to let you go 
She said come on boy, stop wastin' time

The leather's breakin', skirts are shakin', we're feelin' good tonite 
Over in the corner, standin' all alone

The bass is thumpin', the drums are pumpin', it's drivin' me insane 
I must be going crazy, my feet can't feel the floor 

Gonna swan dive in the punch bowl, and go swimmin' for the door

But living with you is like livin' in jail, and I'm tired of doing time 

Kick it! 

Huh! Whoa! 

They say that I've turned crazy on the wrong side of the tracks

Stay out, no, I need no other, I got the Devil by my side 

Riding this wild horse yeah, I'm tangled in its reins 
I've grown scared of tomorrow, yesterday's in my veins 
See the snake bites so quickly, the venom runs so deep 
Now I'm holdin' on while I'm in God's hands as the poison lays my soul to sleep 

Now years are melting faster, habit is my master 
Oh I give a little, take a little, make a little, sell a little 
A stone cold sinner in love, so

No, no, no, no, I won't come easy

1842,Steelheart,Take Me Back Home,"Every step we take is the hard way 
We try to build an empire all in just one day 
But if we take a breath, and take a look around 
Are we missing things, are both feet planted on the ground 

Sometimes we forget who we are 
We take our chances much too far 
Can I find the time to show this heart of mine (a little sunshine in the rain) 
Oh, it's so hard to see, what we've grown to be 
We fight this world alone, yeah, and turn a life to stone 

[Chorus]
Take me back home, the place where we belong 
Where all our hearts still roam, now take me back home 

The grass is always green on the other side 
We climb the walls to find out to ourselves we lied 

Oh we fight so hard to make a stand 
We try and fit the world in the palms of our hands 
Oh we're searching for a piece of mind 
But the world has put money in your hands and made us blind 

Will I reach the light, that leads me through my life 
(Sometimes I hear the angels sing) 
Will I find the road, to ease my heavy load 
Make the right turn, yeah, not to crash and burn 

[Chorus] 

Yeah I still can remember, how we used to be 
Just a couple of little crazy kids, runnin' through the streets 
Now I can't change the future, I can only feel the pain 
I'm holding on, breath by breath, hiding from the rain 

[Chorus: x2]"
